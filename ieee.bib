abstract={Wireless sensor network applications in healthcare and biomedical technology have received increasing attention, while associated security and privacy issues remain open areas of consideration. The relevance of this technology to our growing elderly population, as well as our increasingly over-crowded and attention-drained healthcare systems, is promising. However, prior to the emergence of these systems as a ubiquitous technology, healthcare providers and regulatory agencies must determine an acceptable level of security and privacy. This paper will review biomedical applications of wireless sensor networks, identify security and privacy issues to be addressed, and note some of the proposed methods for securing these systems.},

abstract={The Elite Care Information Technology Group has deployed a system with many elements of pervasive computing, including portable and wearable devices and wireless networking, to create intelligent and responsive work and living spaces for the elderly in a residential setting. Elite Care based the setting's layout on an apartment complex rather than a hospital with its hallways and rooms. By using a social care model that has the staff making house calls rather than doctors making rounds, the residents continue to live as normally as they can. In this scheme, pervasive sensors and staff assist residents in maintaining their independence, offering assistance as necessary and using the pervasive sensors to monitor vital signs and health indicators. Elite Care has harnessed the technology in direct and important ways to construct a more humane and human world for its residents and staff.},

abstract={In this paper we analyse demographic problems and propose a solution for taking care of elderly in Europe. We present the nearly completed system for posture and movement recognition in the European FP7 project CONFIDENCE - Ubiquitous Care System to Support Independent Living. CONFIDENCE aims at providing care for the elderly using radio tags attached to the body providing positions and acceleration. The central part of the system deals with the reconstruction and interpretation of the user's behaviour in order to raise an alarm or issue a warning if a fall or an unusual mid- or long-term behaviour is detected. In this paper, the two systems are presented from the user. The first results and demonstrations show supreme performance; however, the costs of the research prototype surpass acceptability for a normal end-user. Cheaper commercial versions will be developed to help elderly live better.},

abstract={Elders are becoming a significant part of the population, in particular in Europe and Japan, where the decrease of the birthrate is becoming a serious social and political issue [1]. Additionally, people prone to a high risk of cardiac diseases are also increasing, mainly to due to the stress, unhealthy food, smoking habits and low exercise live style. On the other hand, current health programs for cardiac rehabilitation are expensive [2] and force the patients to miss working time to go to rehabilitation centers for assisted training. Therefore, the development of an home-based rehabilitation program based on games technology seems to be a good approach to minimize this problem. This demo presents a system for home assisted rehabilitation using the Kinect sensor, from Microsoft.},

abstract={One of the biggest drivers behind IT-based homecare solutions is the increasing aging population. We are specifically interested in "service tailoring" for the homecare domain, where healthcare professionals (care-givers) do the tailoring of services to support elderly (care-receivers). Our goal is that, using our approach, care-givers can create or modify services with less IT skills, time and/or effort, and care-receivers get services that are better suited for their specific and personal needs. As a proof of concept, we developed a software prototype of our approach. The prototype was subsequently used in a real-world field test at a care institution in the Netherlands to validate the approach. The validation focused on the usability aspects of the approach in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, learnability and satisfaction. This paper describes the design of the field test and reflects on the outcome of the validation experiments.},

year={2010}, 
pages={134-139}, 
abstract={Taking care of an elder with cognitive decline is not an easy task. Given their condition, elders could be involved in situations that may affect their physical integrity or quality of life, and caregivers may be unaware of the situation or not be able to attend it on time. This paper proposes a context-aware notification environment to support the work of caregivers. The aim is to increase the caregiver's awareness about the situations of care of older people in a nursing home, so that caregivers could act appropriately and timely to attend those situations. Firstly, we present the results of a study to understand the situations of care that occur at a nursing home. Later, we propose the design of a context-aware notification environment whose design was informed by this understanding. One of the main features of this environment is that it takes into consideration the contextual information both from the caregiver and from the elder in order to adapt the notification. Preliminary results of the evaluation of an implementation with an audio notification mechanism are promising. During the evaluation period caregivers perceived an increase in their awareness of the situations of care and a safer working environment regarding the provided quality of care.},

abstract={The population of elderly people keeps increasing rapidly, which becomes a predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a new approach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient intelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to construct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain independent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL that remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the power of human being, and the importance of social connections and social activities is less noticed. Our conjecture is that such features are fundamental prerequisites towards truly effective AAL services. This paper reviews the current status of researches on AAL, discusses the promises and possible advantages of AAL, and also indicates the challenges we must meet in order to develop practical and efficient AAL systems for elderly people. In this paper, we also propose an approach to construct effective home-care system for the elderly people.},

In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts. The architecture was validated from a functional point of view through a proof-of-concept.},

abstract={Games with remote controls and motion sensors that require the players to move, so-called exergames, have become very popular. Many of these games are also being played by the senior population. Participating in regular training sessions outside their homes can be challenging for elderly, and it is hard to motivate oneself to exercise regularly alone at home. Regular physical activity is important both for the physical and psychological health and it is an integral part of many rehabilitation therapies. In addition, many elderly suffer from loneliness, making social interaction within exergames very important. In this paper we provide a narrative review of how exergames can help to motivate elderly to exercise more, focusing in possible social interactions in online exergaming and persuasive technologies. Finally, we discuss how social exergaming can be used both to prevent loneliness and encourage physical activity.},

abstract={Wireless body sensors combined with ubiquitous Wireless Sensor Networks enable pervasive healthcare applications. This technology can significantly improve the quality of life of chronically ill and elderly. Remote medical monitoring applications consist of many features as continuous medical monitoring, emergency alerts, location tracking and home automation. These heterogeneous systems have to implement Quality of Service mechanisms to ensure that the different functions have their QoS requirements satisfied, that the most important traffic still has its QoS requirements fulfilled in case of network overload and finally that QoS mechanisms are able to adapt dynamically depending on the context. From our knowledge, QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks for healthcare has never been studied from the context-awareness specific perspective, although context-awareness is the core issue of WSN for healthcare and that these networks have specific characteristics in comparison with most WSN. Health monitoring applications demand high reliability as life of human beings is involved, therefore Quality of Service support in such systems is vital. As patient may evolve from a non-critical health status to a critical one, context-awareness is essential to adapt the network performance to the new situation. In this paper we study the specific QoS requirements of healthcare applications. Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of related work regarding these characteristics and context-awareness. Finally, we point out remaining challenges and open research issues.},

abstract={Smart homes have significant potential to enhance the lives of older adults, extending the period of healthy ageing, through monitoring wellbeing, detecting decline and applying interventions to prevent or slow down this decline. In this paper we present results from interviews with 7 older adults who have been living in smart homes for over 4 years. Our aims were to 1) examine attitudes to living with sensors and AAL technology over time; 2) gather opinions on the usefulness of this data for supporting self-management of health and wellbeing and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of various visualization techniques for presenting sensor-based health and wellness data. Our findings show that older adults are interested in receiving feedback from sensor technology to support them self-managing their wellbeing. Potential beneficial information includes time spent inside and outside the home, walking time, sleep, activity, blood pressure and weight. This information needs to be enhanced by education and goal-setting and by representing data using visualisations that are simple and intuitive.},

It integrates functions of two systems developed within the two research projects MonAMI (6FP) and SMILING (7FP) where we participated. The main goal is to ensure higher safety for seniors who are in risk of falls and are living alone. The first module of the integrated rehabilitation system is aimed to identification of falls and emergency communication system for the households of elderly living alone. The platform for that is system developed under the 6FP - MonAMI. The second module of the diagnostic and rehabilitation system plays a preventive role as a home rehabilitation device used for regular training of gait during daily activities. The device is based on an innovation of the motorized mechatronic shoe TUKE developed under the 7FP project SMILING. Users train their walk ability during performance of everyday tasks while solving unexpected perturbations simulating influence of external environment by surmounting the uncertainty when stepping on. The complex system is undertaking the challenge to come in market where we see an absence of preventive, diagnostic-rehabilitation centers aimed on people (elderly) with risk of fall.

abstract={Allele specific polymerase chain reaction method (AS-PCR) was developed, validated and employed to determine the type and frequency of genetic polymorphism in NMDA receptor gene, GRIN2B for single nucleotide polymorphism rs10845840. The study has been approved by the relevant human ethics committee. Blood samples were collected in sodium-citrate tubes and stored at −80°C until further analysis. The genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood using the salting out technique. Allele specific primers were designed using the appropriate software. The polymerase chain reaction method was optimised and validated using DNA sequencing technique. Sixty samples from healthy volunteers were analysed. The results demonstrated that 85% of the subjects had CC allele, 12% had CT allele and 3% had TT allele. The assay would be useful for detection of the polymorphism in GRIN2B gene since the variations that occurred in the analysed samples were more than 1%. Recently, the gene has been reported to be associated with human brain volume (temporal lobe). It was also reported that the reduced temporal lobe volume in the elderly was associated with an increased in Alzheimer's disease risk. The optimised method will be used subsequently to elucidate the type and frequency of GRIN2B polymorphism among Alzheimer's disease patients in Malaysia.},

The paper aims at proposing a flexible and reliable monitoring system based on embedded systems and wearable devices. The system main feature is that it allows the doctor and family members to monitor the patients at distance using their mobiles. A suitable communication with the first aid center is foreseen for a fast rescue of the patients in case of critical situations. A user model ontology is adopted so that patient and context data may be used by any diagnostic and first aid software, thus envisaging an open and interoperable health monitoring system for elderly people living at home.

abstract={The growing of ageing population worldwide and the need to concentrate research efforts on a specific target group motivate our research and focus on frail ageing people with chronic disease and physical/cognitive deficiencies. The primary goal is to maintain frail and dependant people in their own home and delay as much as possible their placement in a nursing home, through reliable assistive technologies, to maximize their physical and mental function, and to continue to engage in social networks with the community, so that they can continue to lead an independent and purposeful life. Today, providing assistive services for frail and dependant people could be done following two ways: the first axis consists on seeking assistive technologies dedicated not only to end-users, but also, and even mainly, to helper around the user (relatives, neighbours, caregivers,..) to supervise Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The second axis could be to concentrate on rehabilitation and coaching solutions targeting people with chronic disease (ex. diabetes type 2) helping them modify their lifestyle to manage their health conditions. Such systems focus mainly on developing serious games deployable at home and connected to regional or national health information systems (e.g. the shared medical file database in France). Consequently, in both options, the development cost is high, and this is also the reason that most smart home projects are still at the research lab level worldwide. There are efforts trying to transfer the research lab demonstration prototypes into homes or nursing homes, but migrating systems from a well controlled research lab environment into a much more complex real-world environment introduces tremendous challenges in terms of correctness, reliability and fault-tolerant requirements.

abstract={Understanding human behaviour and activities is a challenging problem in computer vision. In application areas like health care and ambient intelligence, the use of a camera feed might be seen as too invasive and may be resented. Human behaviour understanding can combine images, signals, feature extraction and other machine learning techniques. This paper presents an overview of our technique that aims to investigate low cost and acceptable visual camera monitoring systems for the elderly. The main idea is to limit the amount of information that needs to be transmitted from the visual sensor unit. The proposed technique will use only filtered images, without saving or transmitting any visual information and thus maintaining privacy.},

abstract={This paper presents the use of PANGEA platform applied to improve healthcare and assistance to elderly and dependent people in geriatric residences. PANGEA is based on Virtual Organizations of agents (VO) and integrates a set of autonomous deliberative agents designed to support the carers' activities and to guarantee that the patients are given the right care. The system makes use of Wireless Sensor Networks and a Real-Time Locating System for providing autonomous responses according to the environment status. Agents are a suitable alternative to manage the enormous quantity of data provided of sensors because they can represent autonomous entities by modelling their capabilities, expertise and intentions. This approach facilitates the inclusion of context-aware capabilities when developing intelligent and adaptable systems, where functionalities can communicate in a distributed and collaborative way. Several tests have been performed to evaluate this framework and preliminary results and conclusions are presented.},

abstract={Cardiovascular disease affects the health of people seriously in the world, especially in the elderly. This paper proposes an effective approach of detecting and analyzing the health status of the elderly. In this work, we continuously acquire Ballisto cardiography (BCG) signal with the micro-movement sensitive mattress (MSM) during non-intrusive sleep in home environment. In the paper, we propose a new method to extract heartbeat intervals (RR) based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), and extract the signal features by calculating the parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) from time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis and nonlinear analysis. A Naïve Bayesian Classification method is applied to classify the normal persons, hypertension patients and coronary heart disease (CHD) patients by using the obtained features. The proposed method is evaluated by using the BCG datasets from eighteen subjects, including eight females and ten males (age 40-72). The results are satisfactory and can provide a classification precision of 92.3%.},

abstract={This paper presents results of user evaluations with a socially assistive robot companion for older people suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and living (alone) at home. Within the European FP7 project “CompanionAble” (2008-2012) [1], we developed assistive technologies combining a mobile robot and smart environment with the aim to support these people and assist them living in their familiar home environment. For a final evaluation, user experience studies were conducted with volunteer users who were invited to a test home where they lived and freely used the robot and integrated system over a period of two days. Services provided by the companion robot include reminders of appointments (pre-defined or added by the users themselves or their informal carer) as well as frequent recommendations to specific activities, which were listed e.g. by their family carers. Furthermore, video contact with relatives and friends, a cognitive stimulation game designed especially to counter the progress of cognitive impairments, and the possibility to store personal items with the robot are offered. Recognition of the user entering or leaving the home is triggering situation specific reminders like agenda items due during the (expected) absence, missed calls or items not to be forgotten. Continuing our previous work published in [2], this paper presents detailed description of the implemented assistive functions and results of user studies conducted during April and May 2012 in the smart house of the Dutch project partner Smart Homes in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.},

This scenario is similar to the very scarce use of telemedicine in healthcare. The present work begins analyzing why fall detectors have not achieved to permeate the industry. That road is used to know the drawbacks of current devices and systems, besides to allow studying several important concepts underlying the principles of fall detection. A novel smart detection system based on that survey is finally briefly presented. The design of this device is founded on the experience and results obtained by an earlier device that was designed in the framework of the thesis of one of the authors.},

abstract={This work presents a sound recording system for elderly security with low-complexity computation. To reduce the time complexity, the proposed system utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with only multiplication to replace the traditional modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). Such a transform can effectively reduce the computational time of proposed system. For recording the zeroes of the wavelet coefficients, an efficient zero recording algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses different encoding mode and corresponding bit data structure to further improve compression performance. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve about 33-fold improvement of the computation speed compared with the baseline, with also the similar rate-distortion performance. Such results indicate that the proposed system is superior to the baseline work to further be applied in low-end sound recording device for home-care services.},

abstract={Over the past century, in most developed and rapidly developing countries, there has been a continual increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition and medicine. However, this is now coupled with aging population demographics and falling birth rates, which when combined, are expected to significantly burden the socio-economic well-being of many of these countries. In fact, never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions for the healthcare and social needs and well-being of the elderly. In this presentation, we will describe an ongoing project in Ubiquitous (U)-Healthcare - a smart medical home. In our work, we are using advances in information technology, wireless communication, web-based technologies and autonomics, to develop new, smart and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such a solution would enable elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being continuously monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated earlier than in later stages as is currently done; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. In this presentation, through a few examples, we will discuss our ongoing work and the challenges we have uncovered, plus some of the research issues we are pursuing. In particular, we will focus on the critical role of information technology (IT) in developing innovative, low-cost and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis. Several examples will be described to highlight IT for U-Health.},

Although the measurements are not taken in a controlled setting, there are distinct advantages to being able to collect data frequently in a naturalistic setting. Routine measurements over time allow us to detect trends in various aspects of cognitive performance and avoid biases due to education, culture, and experience.},

abstract={Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging, and is recognized as a major contributing factor to disability and loss of independence in the elderly. Recent evidence shows that age-related loss of muscle strength and power (dynapenia), as well as muscle fatigue are a better predictor of disability. In this paper we describe three ambient casual games that have been designed to measure arm muscle strength and fatigue utilizing a custom-designed interaction device that provides a natural user interface for the games. The games are designed to be used frequently and for short periods of time. We conducted a formative evaluation of the games with 5 older adults to assess ease of use and their interest in playing them. We compare the results of traditional measures of muscle strength using a clinical dynamometer with those obtained using the videogame. The higher frequency with which measures can be obtained from playing the videogame can result in a more reliable and timely assessment of risks of dynapenia and frailty.},

A Web-based survey has been developed to begin to measure the drinking norms at Foxfield with the hopes of using the data to create a safer environment at future events. Using a limited sample of 78 students, the preliminary data show that students drink more at Foxfield than each day of a normal week. Students also report drinking more and longer at Foxfield than during Halloween and football games (events known to be large social events at UVA). 66% of respondents also reported at least one negative consequence as a result of another's drinking and 68% reported at least one negative consequence as a result of his own drinking.

pages={541-545}, 
abstract={Walking is a popular recreation activity. In addition, it is a mild and healthy exercise for the elderly. However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. The development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a main topic of this paper. We discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. In the previous report, we developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. In this paper, we propose a new structure to control a frictional resistance force that is generated on the surface of the MSE and a metal pin. In addition, we propose to use this device as a single unit for the haptic device on feet. According to the compressive test of the unit, the maximum force that can be controlled with the unit is insufficient yet. However, it appears that we can control frictional force with the proposed structure. We also conducted a simulation to estimate required values of the performance for the unit. It is much higher than the current state of the unit. We have to improve the performance of the unit in the future.},

year={2013}, 
pages={184-191}, 
abstract={Automatically estimating a person's energy expenditure has numerous uses, including ensuring sufficient daily activity by an elderly live-alone person, such activity shown to have numerous benefits. Most previous work requires a person to wear a sensor device. We introduce a video-based activity level estimation technique to take advantage of increasingly-common in-home camera systems. We consider several features of a motion bounding rectangle for such estimation, including changes in height and width, and vertical and horizontal velocities and accelerations. Experiments involved 36 recordings of normal household activity, such as reading while seated, sweeping, and light exercising, involving 4 different actors. Results show, somewhat surprisingly, that the feature horizontal acceleration leads to an activity level estimation fidelity of 0.994 correlation with a commercial BodyBugg body-worn energy measurement device. Furthermore, the approach yielded 90.9% average accuracy of energy expenditure.},

pages={1-4}, 
abstract={FitForAll (FFA) exergaming platform helps elderly to entertain themselves while they do their workout. Motion sensing devices depict user's movement patterns on a game screen. The work described here, highlights the significance of developing human-computer interaction systems focusing on the needs of end-users. Specific design techniques are adopted in order to provide seniors with content that is easily accessible and comprehensible. Some early results of a first prototype are presented. 14 seniors in total, either healthy or with cognitive decline (either mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) have provided feedback on several aspects of platform usability. An additional evaluation component of the platform that is thoroughly investigated is the affective evaluation of the FFA platform. An important conclusion that stems from the present research is the highly significant predictive value of affective states on usability evaluation, highlighting the important role of the entertaining exergaming environment regarding its usability. Further investigation on the enhancement of seniors' affective experience during game play is of utmost importance to us, as there is strong evidence that dynamic game content adaptation according to one's affective state would result into better training adherence and seniors' reinforcement of motivation.},

abstract={If we watch elderly people at home for health or security purposes, we need a reliable pervasive information from a domestic network of localizing sensors allowing to follow the different locations at which the dependent persons can be detected. The data recorded can be treated as the sequence of color coded numbers of balls (symbolizing rooms) taken in a Polya's urn, in which the persistence of the presence in a room is taken into account by adding a certain number of balls of the same color as the ball just drawn. We discuss the pertinency of such a procedure to early detect sudden or chronic changes in the parameters values of the random process made of the succession of ball numbers and we use it to trigger alarms, whose level depends on the real biological age of the elderly people watched at home.},

year={2014}, 
pages={240-245}, 
abstract={Wireless body area network (WBAN) is an emerging technology that provides socialized health monitoring service. However, the quality of service can be severely degraded by concomitant inter-WBAN interference in some specific environments where multiple WBANs are densely deployed, e.g., hospitals and senior citizen communities. In this work, we propose a Bayesian game based power control scheme to mitigate the impact of inter-WBAN interference. By modeling WBANs as players and active links as types of players in the Bayesian game model, the proposed power control scheme tries to maximize each player's expected payoff involving both throughput and energy efficiency. We prove the existence of Bayesian equilibrium (BE) for the proposed power control game and also derive a practical sufficient condition for the uniqueness of BE. A harmonic mean based algorithm is then proposed to obtain an approximation of BE point without the need to pass message among WBANs, which satisfies the non-cooperative manner for inter-WBAN interference mitigation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge to the BE point effectively.},

abstract={Elder people are becoming a predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. This paper proposes a design to construct a virtual ambient assisted living community where dwellers make contributions to the community so as to best utilize resources and minimize costs. We use service oriented architecture (SOA) to orchestrate the available resources inside the community, thus bringing social intelligence to the social computing. We also propose building such a virtual community making use of virtual reality and in the form of serious game [Stuart Rory, 1996]. Daily activities and instruments (such as sensors, cameras, etc.) in real-life may be translated into their virtual community equivalents, and activities happening in the virtual world will trigger corresponding actions in the real world, so that inter-reality may be obtained through this virtual community. We expect such a virtual community could help not only efficiently utilizing the social resources in maintaining the independent living of the elderly people, but also helping these people maintain their connections to the society and bring them entertainment, so that the quality of their living standard may be improved at the same time.},

abstract={A software architecture for smart watches supporting and securing the everyday life for the elderly is presented. The approach starts from the insight that the usage of smart watches for care-giving and handling personal health hazards is a best practice driven, empirical discipline, requiring a declarative, easy to maintain software description for the smart watch devices. The second rationale for the approach presented is the decomposition of the complex interrelations of "health hazards" into definable modules of manageable size, each addressing the handling an individual health hazard. The proposed, hierarchical architecture builds on the automatic detection of the activities and events of daily life (ADLs, EDLs) by the sensors of the smart watch. Handling of health hazards will be modeled by UML state machines, which utilize the detected ADL/EDLs for their state transitions. The architecture has to take account for a plenitude of relevant hazards, managed by a multitude of simultaneously operating state machines, via a central synchronizing control mechanism.},

abstract={Developed societies are currently facing severe demographic changes: the world is getting older at an unprecedented rate. New challenges are raised to the traditional systems of health care. There is an urgent need to find solutions that allow to extend the time people can live in their own environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility. Residing and being cared in the own familiar environment, in contrast to an institutionalized inpatient setting is becoming more attractive for an increasing portion of the population. Ambient Intelligence and, particularly, the development of Ambient Assisted Living environments can help to minimize hospital stays and, in doing so, enable patients an independent life in a domestic environment. However, the complexity of such systems raises fundamental questions of communication and computer-supported cooperation among components, devices and systems. This paper reports on the work developed in the eHealthCom project, an interoperable health-assistive platform designed to meet the requirements of the current health services in caring, monitoring and motivating the elderly population in their own environment.},

title={Choice stepping reaction time test using exergame technology for fall risk assessment in older people}, 
year={2014}, 
pages={6957-6960}, 
abstract={Accidental falls remain an important problem in older people. Stepping is a common task to avoid a fall and requires good interplay between sensory functions, central processing and motor execution. Increased choice stepping reaction time has been associated with recurrent falls in older people. The aim of this study was to examine if a sensor-based Exergame Choice Stepping Reaction Time test can successfully discriminate older fallers from non-fallers. The stepping test was conducted in a cohort of 104 community-dwelling older people (mean age: 80.7 ± 7.0 years). Participants were asked to step laterally as quickly as possible after a light stimulus appeared on a TV screen. Spatial and temporal measurements of the lower and upper body were derived from a low-cost and portable 3D-depth sensor (i.e. Microsoft Kinect) and 3D-accelerometer. Fallers had a slower stepping reaction time (970 ± 228 ms vs. 858 ± 123 ms, P = 0.001) and a slower reaction of their upper body (719 ± 289 ms vs. 631 ± 166 ms, P = 0.052) compared to non-fallers. It took fallers significantly longer than non-fallers to recover their balance after initiating the step (2147 ± 800 ms vs. 1841 ± 591 ms, P = 0.029). This study demonstrated that a sensor-based, low-cost and easy to administer stepping test, with the potential to be used in clinical practice or regular unsupervised home assessments, was able to identify significant differences between performances by fallers and non-fallers.},

Regular exercises help with managing the disease, but physiotherapy is costly and without monitoring there are no reliable workout records and many patients lack motivation. In this paper we evaluate exercise games and motivate the need for applications which are mobile, fun, provide monitoring, and incorporate social media features. Based on this we develop a smartphone-based golf game, which uses GPS and accelerometer sensors for collecting monitoring data and motivating patients to get active. The physical simulation uses an experimentally derived formula to convert wrist accelerometer data into driving distance. User testing demonstrates that the exercise game is entertaining and has a sufficient realism, but more game psychology concepts need to be incorporated to improve playability.},

abstract={Depression and loneliness among the elderly are one of the biggest problems affecting the world population. This leads to elderly isolation which is a major risk factor for suicide. Moreover, if isolation is coupled with physical illness and incapacitation, such a risk increases exponentially. To fight back this problem, roboticists have been proposing solutions to autonomously monitor, support and even promote physical activities among the elderly. Nevertheless, those appear as very high-cost and complex solutions that require an advanced technical expertise. Recent off-the-shelf solutions, such as the well-known NAO robot, emerged as possible alternatives. An extension to the NAO robot, denoted as RIA, is being developed at the Engineering Institute of Coimbra (ISEC). The RIA is not only built for a social interaction with the elderly but also as an autonomous tool to promote professional care through the analysis of health and environmental parameters. Therefore, the RIA robot is an adapted NAO low-cost platform equipped with several sensors that can measure different parameters like body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. By validating this valuable platform, the foundations were laid for a whole new paradigm in elderly care.},

The research aims to design human robot interaction towards automated medication support for older people [3], [4]. In the current design, the older people are guided by a Stationary Robotic Medication Management System (StRoMMS) while they take their daily medications in their independent living quarters in a retirement village. We performed a pilot user study to evaluate the hypothesized technological requirements of the robotic system as well as the clinical workflow requirements [1] taking into account the health care context. The demonstration shows a snapshot of the interaction for the main medication dialog that the older person undergoes. There are multiple interactions in a day for multiple types of medication scheduled at multiple times. We also show some features of the workflow that ensure any errors are reported in real-time, as well as a feature that ensures the medication regime can be monitored by the health care providers remotely [2] in real-time. The robot also has capabilities to engage the older people by singing and dancing with entertainment content they prefer. Qualitative results from the research is presented in the video and informed a bigger field trial in New Zealand.},

We evaluated the effects of these methods in the corticospinal tract (CST) integrity, through MRI-based tractography. Four patients with middle cerebral artery stroke were evaluated, before and after 32 rehabilitation sessions. After CST identification at the level of the pons, manual regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn, by two independent evaluators. We observed a superior result in the neuronal integrity measurements for both evaluators in the game-rehabilitated patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results suggest that the CST may recover through rehabilitation, and also that games-based rehabilitation may be superior to conventional rehabilitation, although further studies are still necessary to confirm these findings.},

abstract={This contribution addresses the development of technology for the elderly with the aim to improve their general well-being. We report work on a prototype system named CARE that combines the functionality of a digital image frame with an active recommender mode. Recommendations are chosen on the basis of context information acquired by sensors embedded in the user's environment, and a well-being model to carefully decide on at which point in time what kind of activity is most suitable to suggest. We describe conception and implementation of a first CARE prototype that we used for in-situ testing in a senior's home, as well as for gathering feedback on system usage and user appreciation. The paper concludes with some lessons learned from analyzing log file data of the trial period and from conducting a post-trial interview.},

Three application scenarios are implemented using the proposed network architecture. The group-based data collection and data transmission using the ad hoc mode promote outpatient healthcare services for only one medical staff member assigned to a set of patients. Adaptive security issues for data transmission are performed based on different wireless capabilities.

This study investigates the use and contribution of wrist-worn multisensors for activity recognition. We found that accelerometers are the most important sensors and heart rate data can be used to boost classification of activities with diverse heart rates. We propose a genetic algorithm-based fusion weight selection (GAFW) approach which utilizes GA to find fusion weights. For all possible classifier combinations and fusion methods, the study shows that 98% of times GAFW can achieve equal or higher accuracy than the best classifier within the group.},

abstract={Health and mobility of elderly people is becoming a more and more important issue in Indian's ageing societies. New communication-based methods to provide health service with personal health care devices and services are considered promising elements of best medical care for everybody. Among all services a system that can help people living with very less support or care takers around them is essential. To achieve this vision, several technological issues have to be solved: (i) body sensors to monitor vital functions like ECG, BP and Body Temperature have to be developed; (ii) the collected sensor data has to be analyzed to detect emergency situations; (iii) relevant data has to be integrated with other information systems in the work environment of medical experts; (iv) information has to be send in secure way using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. These challenges are addressed within the Ubiquitous Health Care System. The goal of the paper is to develop a framework in which health professionals can remotely monitor and diagnose elderly person or patients.},

year={2014}, 
pages={880-887}, 
abstract={Smart environments have progressed and evolved into a significant research area with development of sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning strategies. Ambient Intelligence incorporated into smart environment assists in resolving many social related applications to facilitate the future society. The initiative of modeling Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in smart homes have helped in the deployment of applications to various domains like elderly care, health care etc. Activity recognition is the task involved in reasoning within smart homes with the aim of recognizing the ongoing activity of the occupant. Constructing an activity model is essential to carry out recognition and is achieved through various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Data driven approach constructs activity model through statistical machine learning mechanisms while knowledge driven approach constructs activity model through knowledge representation and modeling strategies. Uncertainty and temporal data are better handled by data driven approach while re-usability and context based analysis is handled better by knowledge driven approach of activity modeling. To combine the features of data driven and knowledge driven approaches, a hybrid activity modeling technique is required. The proposed system performs activity modeling via Markov Logic Network, a machine learning strategy that combines probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning with a single framework. Activities in a smart home are categorized as simple and composite activities, wherein composite activities are defined as related simple activities within a given time interval. The proposed system models both simple and composite activity using soft and hard rules of MLN. Experiments carried over the proposed system shows the effectiveness of the proposed work for recognizing simple and composite activity.},

abstract={Elders lose independence and wellbeing, accompanied by decreased functions in terms of hearing, vision, strength and coordination abilities. These factors contribute to balance difficulties that eventually lead to falls. The injuries due to falls, at this age, are risky, since most of the times may cause a significant - and permanent - decrease of quality of life or, in extreme cases, death. In this context, a fall detection system can bring an added value to assist elderly people. This paper describes a system consisting of a wearable sensor unit, a smartphone and a website. When the sensor detects a fall it sends an alert using the smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0, to notify the family members or stakeholders. The sensor device includes an inertial unit, a barometer, and a temperature and humidity sensor. The website displays the log of previous falls and enables the configuration of emergency contact numbers. The proposed fall detection system is one of multiple components within a larger project under development that offers a holistic perspective on falls; the complete wearable solution will also feature, among others, physical protection (minimizing the impact of falls that occur).},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to integrate the technologies of radio frequency identification, global positioning system, global system for mobile communications, and geographic information system (GIS) to construct a stray prevention system for elderly persons suffering from dementia without interfering with their activities of daily livings. We also aim to improve the passive and manpowered way of searching the missing patient with the help of the information technology. Our system provides four monitoring schemes, including indoor residence monitoring, outdoor activity area monitoring, emergency rescue, and remote monitoring modes, and we have developed a service platform to implement these monitoring schemes. The platform consists of a web service server, a database server, a message controller server, and a health-GIS (H-GIS) server. Family members or volunteer workers can identify the real-time positions of missing elderly using mobile phone, PDA, Notebook PC, and various mobile devices through the service platform. System performance and reliability is analyzed. Experiments performed on four different time slots, from three locations, through three mobile telecommunication companies show that the overall transaction time is 34 s and the average deviation of the geographical location is about 8 m. A questionnaire surveyed by 11 users show that eight users are satisfied with the system stability and 10 users would like to carry the locating device themselves, or recommend it to their family members},

A semi-automatic vision function, heart rate sensors and physiological stress sensors have been integrated. GPRS system is used for location determination and GSM is used to communicate in those cases where certain abnormal events like falling, accident or health issues are trigged. The real-time interaction functions are designed with the motive to make the user operating the wheel-chair completely self-dependent and his interaction with the environment can be like of a normal person.},

abstract={Recent advances in cloud computing and ubiquitous computing have changed the computing paradigm rapidly. Cloud computing is the computing that relies on a large pool of systems interconnected in private or public networks to deliver computing resources like services and data. Nowadays, there is no need of having local servers or personal devices to handle applications and data. Access to these resources for everyone and anywhere has become a necessity. Moreover, the evolution of ubiquitous computing combined with cloud computing implies the development of personalized services and applications considering the user preferences in order to provide an appropriate user interface anywhere anytime. However, the user interfaces so far are not conforming to the needs of people and especially those with disabilities or elderly. The paper introduces an accessible tool for declaring and managing user preferences that participate in personalization implementation in cloud computing environment. The proposed tool focuses mostly on elderly and people with disabilities and helps the users to build preference sets in order to improve access efficiency.},

year={2015}, 
pages={575-580}, 
abstract={Intelligent systems and smart devices have played the major role in improving the healthcare organisation in terms of continuous tele-monitoring therapy and maintaining telemedicine management system for sickle cell disease. The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required. A machine-learning algorithm was conducted to perform the classification process.

abstract={The role of managers in a Scrum organization is a topic of high interest with almost no research. Changes in management roles and behaviors were evaluated in a rapidly growing, social entertainment and gaming company in Finland. Sulake introduced Scrum in 2006 and within 6 months institutionalized Scrum across the organization. The company was surveyed in 2009 and responses from 19 managers and 36 non-managers were carefully studied. The biggest challenges of Scrum for managers were keeping up with the team and learning to "let go" and stop micro-managing the teams. Managers report Scrum increases productivity (73%), increases quality (58%), and makes it easier to change direction (84%). The role of the manager changes from telling people what to do into communicating goals and visions (a key insight of Takeuchi and Nonaka). Increased responsibility of the team affects hiring practices of managers in a Scrum company.},

abstract={Simplified computers become more important than ever before in our modern life. However, this new-form computer actually has many ergonomic problems according to previous user experiences. As the coming era of the elderly, the elderly people have many chances to use simplified computers. It is also why many related ergonomic studies have been the trends of current research focuses. In this study, we use the usability engineering methods to study the design principle of simplified computers. The experimental equipment includes ACER Iconia Tab, and ASUS Eee transform-Pad, and experimental software includes Game software, Social networking software, Chinese short article and Web site browser, together with the combination of both subjective interface usability attitude inventory and objective inventory survey to enhance our research results. Our conclusions are that elderly people have poor performance in operating social networking software, Chinese type-in and browsing the worldwide web site, because of their less usage experiences. Next, when Elderly people are using transform-Pad, they have better performance on game software than on social networking software, Chinese type-in and browsing the website.},

abstract={The analysis of intake behaviour is a key factor to understand the health condition of a subject, such as elderly or people affected by diet-related disorders. The technology can be exploited for this purpose to promptly identify anomalous situations. To this end, the point cloud, provided by a depth camera placed on the ceiling in top-down view, is used as input to three self-organising algorithms. The output are three different models that represent the monitored person during intake activities. Starting from these models, the nodes representing the head and the hands are selected. They are useful to identify most of the actions performed by the person while having a meal. In the experimental section, the positions of these nodes are compared with a ground truth and the performance of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of distance error.},

The domain of home assistance also includes caring for the elderly. Healthcare services globally are seeking to allow people to stay in their familiar home environments longer due to the multitude of benefits associated with living in non-clinical environments and technologies to determine an individual's movements are key to ensuring home emergencies detected through lack of movement can be responded to promptly. This paper proposes a device-free technique which would enable the individual to proceed with normal daily activities without the concern of having to wear a traceable device. The principle behind this is that the human body will absorb/reflect the signal being transmitted from a transmitter to one or more monitoring stations. Results are presented which demonstrate that human detection and tracking is possible to within 1.5m resolution.},

The most likely to benefit from these smart homes are people in loss of autonomy such as the disabled people or the elderly with cognitive deficiencies. But it becomes essential to ease the interactions with the smart home through dedicated interfaces, in particular, thanks to systems reactive to vocal orders. Audio recognition is also a promising way to ensure more safety by contributing to detection of distress situations.

abstract={Ubiquitous is a Latin-derived word meaning "to exist at any time and place" likes water or air. In computing, the word "ubiquitous" indicates an environment in which users have access to networks without any limitation regarding computers, networks or places. Important issues in building Ubiquitous Korea (U-Korea) are the social problems appearing with a rapid increase in the old age population. Nowadays, with the rise of the nuclear family, the increase in the number of elderly people living alone, and the change in the status of women, both wives and husbands are employed outside the home, and the relatives who would be responsible for supporting the elderly sometimes are on long or short business trips, and it happens that old people can't be looked after. Therefore the government developed a wireless paging system for the sick , disabled, old and weak so that when an emergency happens, by just simply dialing 119, an emergency aid center could take prompt action. However, the present wireless paging systems composing the under-layer of the emergency aid information system have some problems, such as, a lack of reliability, problems among terminals, mobile transmitters and receiving terminals, the users' refusal to admit the need for the system and poor operational skills, administrators' perfunctory management and checks, etc. On account of these problems, the system efficiency has degraded and therefore a system upgrade is necessary. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the newly implemented SAFE119 system, a new wireless paging system seeking to correct the problems of the current system.},

pages={23-27}, 
abstract={In advanced countries throughout the world, the population of Alzheimer's Disease(AD) patients has been gradually increasing with the aging of the society. As a result, it has become an important research topic how to diagnose AD early and give necessary treatment and training to AD patients, especially those with mild cognitive impairment(MCI), whose executive functions such as response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, attention switching and planning may display evident disorder and impairment. Unlike traditional paper tests and subjective assessments by the patient's relatives, this study adopts virtual reality(VR) technology to develop a novel diagnosis & assessment system, which uses head mounted display(HMD), game technology and sensors to generate an interactive and panoramic scenario-a virtual convenience store-for assessment of executive functions and memory. A variety of tasks of multi-layered difficulty-level hierarchy, such as memorizing a shopping list, looking for certain goods, and checking out, has been designed for customized and adaptive assessment, training, and treatment of MD. In the meantime, the study also records test-takers' performance data (including path and central-vision movement) in the process of all tasks for the development of a novel diagnosis & assessment method. Moreover, test-takers' technology acceptance is measured for assessing the elderly's subjective perception of new technology and discussing the topic of human-machine interaction. In the study, tests on 2 healthy adults have been completed, the system's functionality has been preliminarily verified, and test-takers' subjective perception of the system has been investigated.},

abstract={Tripping and slipping are serious health concerns for the elderly because they result in life threatening injuries i.e., fractures and high medical costs. Our recent work in detection of tripping gait patterns has demonstrated that minimum toe clearance (MTC) is a sensitive falls risk predictor. MTC measurement has previously been done in gait laboratories and on treadmills which potentially imposes controlled walking conditions. In this paper, we describe a prototype design of a wireless device for monitoring vertical toe clearance. The sensors consists of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope connected to Crossbow sensor motes for wireless data transmission. Sensor data are transmitted to a laptop and displayed on a Matlab graphic user interface (GUI). We have performed zero base and treadmill experiments to investigate sensor performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20m indoors and 50m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements were found to follow the Optotrak measurement trend but could be improved further by dealing with double integration errors and improving data transmission rates.},

abstract={The advancement of medical technology greatly extends people's lifespan. Nevertheless, the continuous falling of birth rate has promoted an “aging population” in many nations. It also means that more emphasis will be placed on improving the quality of life and care for the elders. Most long-term care services in Taiwan are provided on an institutional basis by nursing homes due to the structural changes in society and family. Traditional family-based home care system is perishing. Once an elderly people are unable to care for himself, he must be placed in a nursing home. The majority of the elderly, however, would much prefer "age in place" and live out their lives where they belong. Taiwan and other countries around the world are all striving for establishing pervasive community care services. To provide more responsive and personalized care services, this research aims to develop a “Smart Community Care System (SCCS)” based on the concept of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Mobile Agent (MA) technologies. Caregivers may locate care-receivers easily in a community with RFID while MA furnishes timely and accurate information for the care provision. The care historical data can be automatically recorded as well. The SCCS is expected to be able to promote the pervasive community care services with convenience, context awareness and accuracy.},

Depth images have been collected continuously for about eight months from several apartments at a senior housing facility. Shape descriptors such as bounding box information and image moments were extracted from silhouettes of the depth images. The features were then clustered using Possibilistic C Means for resident identification. This technology will allow researchers and health professionals to gather more information on the individual residents by filtering out data belonging to non-residents. Gait related information belonging exclusively to the older residents can then be gathered. The data can potentially help detect changes in gait patterns which can be used to analyze fall risk for elderly residents by passively observing them in their home environments.},

However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. Especially, development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a new challenge. In this paper, we discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. We developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. According to the experimental results on a dot-type braille block, a target level of the maximum plantar pressure was clarified. On the basis of these results, we designed a unit for the haptic device on feet.},

This article presents an initiative to evaluate activity recognition systems: a living-lab evaluation established through the annual Evaluating Ambient Assisted Living Systems through Competitive Benchmarking-Activity Recognition (EvAAL-AR) competition. In the EvAAL-AR, each team brings its own activity-recognition system; all systems are evaluated live on the same activity scenario performed by an actor. The evaluation criteria attempt to capture practical usability: recognition accuracy, user acceptance, recognition delay, installation complexity, and interoperability with ambient assisted living systems. Here, the authors discuss the competition and the competing systems, focusing on the system that achieved the best recognition accuracy, and the system that was evaluated as the best overall. The authors also discuss lessons learned from the competition and ideas for future development of the competition and of the activity recognition field in general.},

These evolved e-Health services can improve the quality of the patient's care, increase the user's interaction, and assure these e-Health applications to be fully compatible with global telemedicine systems.},

abstract={In the Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan (UM), we have spent the past five years building social context into several courses in the traditional computer science (CS) curriculum. Specifically, freshman- and senior-level, project-based classes have been designed to both teach significant and appropriate academic content, while also building software games and apps for children with cognitive and/or physical disabilities within the university's associated hospital. Children with disabilities provide the context for these courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional curriculum. The cadence of the course(s) is typically: propose, pitch, form groups, design, build, test, and improve. Each student submits a written proposal for the project. A group of experts read all of the proposals, and choose the `best' for pitching to the other students in the course. Groups are formed, using student preferences, based upon the pitches. The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final) of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through subsequent independent studies or internships. If the software project is `minimally viable', the groups are encouraged to continue development and work with the university's Center for Entrepreneurship or Office of Technology Transfer toward eventual commercialization. During the past academic year (2013-2014), one of the senior-level courses had the singular focus of developing software apps and games for a 13 year old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy. Her family was actively involved in the course, filt- ring project ideas and offering suggestions for improvement. Some of the most promising apps are currently installed in the family's house for methodical review and eventual improvement. This paper will discuss the general process that is used in this style of course, the specific approach that was used during the 2013-2014 academic year, and offer general suggestions for implementation in disciplines other than computer science.},

abstract={With the aging global population, according to WHO, 1-in-3 individuals over the age of 65 years (a total of 65 million people worldwide) suffer from hearing loss. This paper tap on the ubiquitous mobile device and proposes the development of a mobile phone based assistive visual aid for the elderly hearing impaired to assist them in their daily life when they choose not to or cannot afford to wear hearing aids. In fact, the proposed assistive visual hearing aid can be used by the hearing impaired community at large and not just confined to the elderly. The visual “hearing” aid takes the form of a noninvasive, inexpensive, in-conspicuous and easy-to-use app on a mobile phone or tablet in which the elderly can record the speech. It will automatically perform a speech-to-text conversion locally on the mobile phone in real time such that the elderly can read the text visually. Non-real time conversion is also made available where the conversion is done at the backend server via Internet. This app is intended to enable the hearing impaired community and the elderly to lead a fulfilling and independent lifestyle despite the challenges caused by their impairments.},

abstract={Ambient assisted living technologies (AALT) are considered to offer means for reducing health care burden to societies by prolonging capability for independent living and by improving the quality of life for elderly persons suffering from dementia and their caregivers. This research presents a novel activity support framework for transforming cooking activities in to workflow process models optimized for people suffering from dementia. This is achieved by first splitting a cooking activity in to tasks composed of set of basic actions. Due to nature of dementia, actions taken by a care recipient can be considered to be stochastic. This research presents a model of a care recipient suffering from dementia based on data from literature. The model contains probability distribution of possible outcomes mapped to available basic actions in a cooking activity. This allows the use of Markov decision process (MDP) to determine optimal sequence of actions to perform a cooking activity. The resulting process models can be used as set of instructions by a prompting system or as a process model for a belief monitor type of AALTs. The designed framework was tested by comparing manually constructed and verified process model to one produced by a test computer program. Further research is needed to refine the care recipient model, study transforming cooking recipes into cooking activity models and to validate the framework in real-world settings.},

abstract={Recent advances in wireless technology, sensors and portable devices offer interesting opportunities to enable ubiquitous assistance to individuals in need of prompt help. Providing healthcare services to mobile users, such as, patients, elders, or potential drug abusers, is a rather challenging task. Novel middleware-level supports are required to integrate sensor infrastructures capable of detecting changes in the monitored subjects' health conditions and of alerting medical personnel, and the victim's relatives and friends in case of emergency situations. Along this line, the paper envisions a context-aware middleware-level solution dubbed Pervasive Environment for Affective Healthcare (PEACH). PEACH integrates together various sensors in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) to detect alterations of monitored subjects' affective and physical conditions, aggregate the sensed information, and also detect potentially dangerous situations for the monitored subject. Finally, PEACH aims at providing outdoor assistance to the victim/patient by quickly promoting the formation of ad hoc rescue groups comprising nearby volunteers. Through encouraging results obtained from both simulations and a practical drug-rehabilitation application testbed, the effectiveness of the envisioned PEACH framework is verified.},

Visualizing deviations in ADL can help medical specialists and nurses to recognize disease symptoms at an early stage. This paper presents possible visualizations for identifying such deviations. These visualizations have been iteratively explored and developed with three different medical specialists to better understand which deviations are relevant according to the different medical specialisms and explore how these deviations should be best presented. The study results suggest that the participants found a monthly bar graph in which activities are represented by colours as the most suitable from the ones presented. Although the visualizations of every ADL was found to be more or less relevant by the different medical specialists, the preference for focusing on specific ADL's varied from specialist to specialist.},

abstract={Sensor networks (SNs) placed on human bodies and in the environment can intelligently and unobtrusively support professional teams (for example health care professionals) to improve their work and on the other hand their subjects (for example patients and elderly at hospital or at home). In pervasive healthcare settings, protecting the privacy of the medical care subjects and the medical staff is very important, because the lack of privacy may hinder the broad acceptance of pervasive health technology. Moreover, there is a need of empowering end-users with flexible personalized controls for their personal data collected, processed and communicated via SNs. The privacy protecting mechanisms must be non-obtrusive and context-aware to support the daily private and professional life of the persons. Since the devices/nodes used by patients and medical professionals will have diverse capabilities, many of them with very limited resources, an important question is the implication of the privacy protection mechanisms on the overall system performance. This paper proposes novel flexible privacy protection framework suitable for diverse set of ubiquitous applications; describes evaluation frames for it and investigates the cost of privacy protection. Evaluation of the influence of the context complexity and policy-based management is also presented.},

These wearables might also motivate elderly to be active and live healthy. Unfortunately they are mostly designed for younger users and it is unclear if they are usable by older adults. In order to answer this research question a four week lasting empirical study was conducted regarding individual motivation and activity trackers' usability with 15 participants older than 60 years. During the first session, participants put the activity tracker into operation without further instructions while "thinkingaloud" and mental effort was measured. During the whole study participants used the activity tracker according their personal needs. Usability was measured by Post Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) three different times - during introduction session, middle session after two weeks and at the final session after four weeks. The added value as well as the necessity of an app was evaluated in a crossover design. Therefore, participants used the activity tracker two weeks with and two without app. Aspects concerning user requirements identified during interviews were weighted by a pairwise comparison at the final meeting. Results revealed elderlies' attitude towards usability, requirements, motivation, mental effort and technical affinity of activity tracker under field conditions. All in all activity trackers are accepted and motivating for elderlies as well as they have a suitable usability.},

abstract={Wireless health systems enable remote and continuous monitoring of individuals, with applications in elderly care support, chronic disease management, and preventive care. The underlying sensing platform provides constructs that consider the quality of information driven from the system and ensure the reliability/validity of the outcomes to support the decision-making processes. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model. Indeed, the averaged R2 value for the movements using simple sensor location improve from a general 0.71 to as high as 0.84 for an individual activity type. The different methods present a range of R2 value averages across activity type from 0.64 for sensor location to 0.89 for multidimensional regression, with an average game play MET value of 7.93. Finally, in a leaveone-subject-out cross validation, a mean absolute error of 2.231 METs is found when predicting the activity levels using the best models.},

abstract={This work presents an system developed using artificial intelligence algorithms for getting automatic movements of a robotic bed based on posture classification and identification. We think this kind of devices can be used in hospitals to care for people with motor disabilities. This bed functionality has been developed in response to the requirements defined by the application of our diagnostic methodology [21]. Our diagnostic methodology applied on public hospitals allowed us to understand that the problem of mobility in elderly people and disabled people involves solutions like devices that attend these individuals to achieve movement without many complications. The movement of these patients can be performed routinely or sporadically during their stay in hospital. For patients who require certain routine application of this movement is designed an intelligent monitor system. This intelligent system allows medical experts to program the movements of the robotic bed considering the patient's posture and time. In order to develop this intelligent device, we construct a methodology for bodies classification in lying state using HOG descriptor and pressures sensors positioned in a matrix form on the surface where bodies lie down. it will be done in real time. Due to current technology a limited number of sensors is used, which results in low resolution data array. This work considers the problem of human posture classification with few information (sensors), applying digital process to expand the original data of the sensors and so get more significant data for the classification, however, this is done with low-cost algorithms to ensure the real-time execution.},

The system provides a complete, end-to-end and scalable solution for a wide range of applications ranging from remote healthcare monitoring of elderly people living alone to health management for all the residents in an aged-care facility under a limited number of staff. The major benefits of such a system include its pervasive and unobtrusive nature, an elevated objectivity level and hence quality in health assessment and a significant reduction in service provision cost. The system architecture encompasses the abilities to collect multiple types of data from both static and mobile sensors, transfer such data over either a homogeneous or hybrid wireless network to a central server, and perform data fusion to extract vital information about the health status of the person being monitored},

Hence, there is a growing need for wearable systems for physiologic monitoring. While various biosignals are monitored with traditional approaches, it is worthwhile to investigate alternative sensing techniques in order to improve accessibility and understanding of patients' conditions. This paper presents our laboratory's development of such a wearable system, which makes use of unconventional techniques for physiologic monitoring.

abstract={Signal scavenging is analogous to energy scavenging: seemingly ubiquitous energy in the environs provides the signal for usage as a personnel sensor. Such energy can be used to detect motion, and most importantly falls. Stray signals can be detected in aluminum foil as voltage differences between touched foil (say by hand) compared to that untouched. Spectrum analysis shows the stray electromagnetic noise signal consists substantially of 60 Hz and its harmonics. Also the signal intensity for both touched and untouched monotonically increases with foil area. While personnel monitors find utility in many areas including security, personnel control and activity detection, we believe these putative sensors to be useful in inobtrusive monitoring of elders to provide them with increased independence at a critical time in their lives.},

abstract={Context-aware technology in the home environment can provide an effective mechanism in supporting the wellbeing and autonomy of the elderly challenged by chronic diseases and physical impairments, such as osteoarthritis. Total Hip Replacement (THR) is the most common procedure to relieve both pain and functional disability experienced by elderly patients suffering from end-stage osteoarthritis, thereby improving their quality of life. The paradigm shift in healthcare on shortening in-hospital care has created an atmosphere of misinformation for both the patient and the medical staff about individual patterns of recovery, creating uncertainty about patients' recovery outcomes. This paper presents work on applying User Centred Design methods (UCD) to inform the design of a qualitative measure which will be used as a means to reduce the lack of information around the patient. The described design process elicits functional system requirements, and guides the design of a qualitative measure based on Experience Sampling Method (ESM). The ESM tool will be used to improve and expand the understanding of elderly patient's living experiences after discharge.},

year={2016}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={The world senior population is projected to douDle as a percentage over the whole population in the next decades. In order to preserve or improve the quality of life of this population, as well as to keep healthcare costs sustainable, it is important to better support their ability of independent living. Cognitive decline is a major threat to independent living; it may be experienced in normal aging but it may also lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and more serious neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. Early detection of cognitive decline, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of its evolution for early intervention are a priority. Researchers have found that subtle differences in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) as well as the recognition of subtle errors while performing IADLs may be useful for MCI diagnosis as well as to differentiate different forms of cognitive disorders. However, occasionally performing ability tests in equipped rooms on medical premises has several shortcomings including cost and reliability of results. Pervasive computing coupled with intelligent data analysis can have a major role in this application domain by continuous monitoring of activities at home during daily life. This idea has been at the core of several recent research projects. The main challenges that we are facing are: a) reliability, unobtrusiveness and affordability of the sensor infrastructure, b) precision and robustness of techniques for IADL recognition, c) effectiveness of algorithms for recognizing fine-grained abnormal behaviors identified by clinicians as relevant indicators, d) identification of relevant patterns through long-term data analysis, e) privacy-awareness of data acquisition and management, f) effectiveness of visualization and interaction tools for clinicians. This talk will discuss the above challenges, report the experience on using hybrid statistical and knowledge-based techniques for addressing the recognition tasks, and - dentify critical aspects still to be investigated.},

year={2009}, 
pages={111-116}, 
abstract={This paper is a report of the feasibility and outcome of using a low-cost, commercially available gaming system - Wii Fit - for balance training after stroke. The patient was an 86 year-old woman five weeks after stroke, who was unable to walk without close supervision, even with a walker, due to poor balance and a tendency to fall. In addition to standard physical therapy, the patient participated in four training sessions with the Wii Fit system; each training session included four different games. The outcome measures were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Reach and Lateral Reach tests, Timed Up & Go test (TUG), computerized posturography, and the Short Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ). The tests were done before the intervention and on the last day of training. The SFQ was done during the third training session. The patient greatly enjoyed the training sessions and felt that she was receiving very dasiaup-to-datepsila treatment. She did not experience any discomfort such as nausea or dizziness while using the system. Following combined Wii and standard treatment, the patient demonstrated improved antero-posterior symmetry of stance, and there was a 10 second improvement in her TUG score. When released from hospital, she was able to walk with a walker with minimal supervision. This initial pilot study indicates that the Wii Fit gaming system has the potential to be used in clinical settings in order to improve balance. A full clinical trial is necessary in order to examine this premise.},

abstract={Power electronics are widely used in the transport and energy sectors. Hence, the reliability of these power electronic components is critical to reducing the maintenance cost of these assets. It is vital that the health of these components is monitored for increasing the safety and availability of a system. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic technique for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of power electronic components. There is a need for an efficient prognostic algorithm that is embeddable and able to support on-board real-time decision-making. A time delay neural network (TDNN) is used in the development of failure modes for an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Initially, the time delay neural network is constructed from training IGBTs' ageing samples. A stochastic process is performed for the estimation results to compute the probability of the health state during the degradation process. The proposed TDNN fusion with a statistical approach benefits the probability distribution function by improving the accuracy of the results of the TDDN in RUL prediction. The RUL (i.e., mean and confidence bounds) is then calculated from the simulation of the estimated degradation states. The prognostic results are evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative accuracy (RA) prognostic evaluation metrics.},

abstract={We proposed a completely unconstrained method for long-term monitoring sleep quality of residents in nursing homes using an Internet-based automatic sleep monitoring system, "Umemory". When a resident lies in bed, his/her heart pulsation, respiration, and body movement are sensed by a piezoelectric transducer under a mattress. The corresponding digital signal is sent to database servers via Internet, and further processed in the servers. 1090 days' data from 13 subjects in 2 nursing homes were obtained by this system for evaluation. Through comparing with records provided by nursing home staff, we found that this system could provide detailed information about the nursing home residents' sleep quality. Furthermore, the analysis result provided information such as "in-bed" body movement and sleep quality, which was unable to be constantly observed by nursing home staff at all. Therefore, it is concluded that our method may serve as an effective and convenient tool for automatic monitoring nursing home residents' sleep quality. This system may also lessen the burden of nursing home staff and be used to optimize personal specific healthcare service.},

In this paper we describe a fuzzy logic system for recognizing activities in home environment using a set of sensors: physiological sensors (cardiac frequency, activity or agitation, posture and fall detection sensor), microphones, infrared sensors, debit sensors and state-change sensors. Motivated by the fact that fuzzy controllers have been successfully embedded within billions of dollars in commercial products, plus the characteristic of data providing from each sensor, the fusion of the different sensors has been performed by using fuzzy logic. This fuzzy logic approach allowed us to recognize several activities of daily living (ADLs) for ubiquitous healthcare.},

abstract={This paper describes ongoing work in analyzing sensor data logged in the homes of seniors. An estimation of relative energy expenditure is computed using motion density from passive infrared motion sensors mounted in the environment. We introduce a new algorithm for detecting visitors in the home using motion sensor data and a set of fuzzy rules. The visitor algorithm, as well as a previous algorithm for identifying time-away-from-home (TAFH), are used to filter the logged motion sensor data. Thus, the energy expenditure estimate uses data collected only when the resident is home alone. Case studies are included from TigerPlace, an Aging in Place community, to illustrate how the relative energy expenditure estimate can be used to track health conditions over time.},

abstract={Pervasive computing technologies offer solutions to many of the problems people face in aging. In doing so, they have the potential to support certain values such as human welfare. However, these solutions also have the potential to diminish human values such as trust, privacy and autonomy. Many of such value issues are recurrent, general problems that play out in specific application contexts. By accounting for values during the design of technology, designers would be in a better position to create technology that supports rather than hinders the values of its stakeholders. Yet, there are few methodical approaches to dealing with values in design. Moreover, knowledge on how specific value problems can be tackled is not captured systematically in a reusable way. We propose using Value Sensitive Design to analyze recurrent problems and identify affected stakeholders and their values. We use these analyses as a starting point for generating design patterns, or reusable solutions to recurrent problems, that explicitly include value considerations. We provide an initial set of value-sensitive design patterns as a proof-of-concept.},

abstract={An adequate level of trust must be established between prospective partners before an interaction can begin. In asymmetric trust relationships, one of the interacting partners is stronger. The weaker partner can gain a higher level of trust by disclosing private information. Dissemination of sensitive data owned by the weaker partner starts at this moment. The stronger partner can propagate data to others, who may then choose to spread data further. The proposed scheme for privacy-preserving data dissemination enables control of data by their owner (such as a weaker partner). It relies on the ideas of bundling sensitive data with metadata, an apoptosis of endangered bundles, and an adaptive evaporation of bundles in suspect environments. Possible applications include interactions among patients and healthcare providers, customers and businesses, researchers, and suppliers of their raw data. They will contribute to providing privacy guarantees, which are indispensable for the realization of the promise of pervasive computing},

The influences of social and hedonic factors were examined, in addition to the normally studied utilitarian factors of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Three elderly participants interacted with the Nabaztag, a zoomorphic robot, for 10 days to improve their overall health condition. Hedonic factors were not found to be important for the acceptance of the Nabaztag. However, these factors seemed to be important for building a relationship with the Nabaztag. Social factors were found to be important for the acceptance of robots, but not for building a relationship with the Nabaztag. The results yielded some interesting findings that need more study: (1) the relationship between the place of the Nabaztag and acceptance and use, (2) the relationship between naming the Nabaztag and building a relationship with it and (3) the relationship between using verbal/non-verbal communication and building a relationship with it.},

abstract={Statistics show an aging trend in the world population, which will progressively overload existing health systems. Therefore, we believe that ubiquitous computing will play an important role in domicile settings, coping with the growing need for automated home healthcare support, especially for the sick and elderly. The integration of independently developed off-the-shelf systems (e.g., health-monitoring, entertainment, communications, home automation, etc.) may cause unplanned interactions between them (cf. feature interactions). This is a major concern since the correct/expected behavior of an isolated system may not be the same when deployed in conjunction with other systems, causing interferences, i.e., unexpected outcomes or misbehaviors. The Safe Home Care project tackles this problem to pursuit the safe deployment and reconfiguration of home healthcare smart-spaces. We propose the use of state graphs to represent off-the-shelf systems and predict the occurrence of intra-system's feature interactions. We use pre-deployment simulations to forecast feature interactions before deployment. We assess the applicability and correctness of this approach through a set of simulated home assisted living scenarios.},

abstract={Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a dual effect on human health. Low UV doses promote the photosynthesis of vitamin D and regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, while an excessive UV exposure is the main cause of skin cancer, along with eye diseases and premature skin ageing. Nevertheless, the link between UV radiation levels and UV exposure is not fully understood since exposure data are limited and individual anatomical variations in UV doses are significant. For these reasons, a numeric simulation tool (SimUVEx) has been developed and validated in order to predict the dose and distribution of UV exposure received taking into account postural information and ambient irradiation data. SimUVEx is based on 3D graphics techniques usually used to render virtual environments to estimate the exposure of a 3D virtual manikin characterised as a triangular mesh surface. Each triangle receives a certain quantity of solar energy depending on the direct, diffuse and reflected radiation, the body surface orientation to the sun and the shadows from other parts of the body. The goals of the second version of SimUVEx are to move from individual-based to population-based (e.g., Switzerland and, eventually, Europe) exposure assessment, expanding temporal, spatial and morphological simulation capabilities. Outputs from SimUVEx version 2 will allow building exposure scenarios, identifying high-risk situations and producing reference dose ranges for typical outdoor occupational and leisure activities.},

abstract={Home monitoring plays an important role within pervasive healthcare, particularly for monitoring the elderly and patients with chronic disease. For assessing activities of daily living, one of the most challenging problems for research remains that of accurate transition detection and characterisation. Early detection of a change in these transitions, such as difficulty getting up from a seated position, can be an indicator of further complications which often precede a fall. Such changes can also accompany early stage neurological disorders which can be treated effectively to improve quality of life. In this paper, we present a system for the accurate characterisation of motion based upon the fusion of ambient and wearable sensors. A probabilistic, privacy respectful method for the extraction of detailed 3D posture information is proposed and fusion with an ear-worn accelerometer and gyroscope is discussed. We present results detailing high accuracy in the recognition of complex motions over four subjects.},

A questionnaire were distribute to the elderly who were aged about 55 and older and live in Taichung district and participating in community center or senior's organizations. Total 265 useable samples were collected. The data analysis used SPSS17.0. and AMOS17.0. Structure model was used to determine the relationship between each variable. For physical health, the self-rated health condition was measured by the questionnaire of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The finding reveal that the data fit the model moderately well and physical health influence elderly decision to consume food away from home. The study can offer restaurants some strategies to attract more seniors such as creating an elderly friendly environment and providing better services.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a concept that seeks to provide most autonomy, security, and health services for elderly people offering technology solutions to them. When AAL applications are provided through the Internet, it is possible to create new applications involving the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The AAL-IoT applications can be used to event detection (such as fall detection or blood pressure) and send messages to an emergency service or a family member through the Internet. The event detection is frequently performed by sensor networks. However, these networks can present some difficulties to provide the high quality of service required for AAL-IoT applications. Thus, this paper proposes a new routing metric that considers information about the nodes and their connections, seeking the network performance enhancement for AAL-IoT. The proposed metric is an additive composition of information about link quality and nodes energy. The results obtained through simulation show that the proposed routing metric can increase the network performance to better meet the AAL-IoT requirements.},

abstract={Nowadays, for supporting the independent living and emergency treatment of the elderly, a number of individuals (e.g., professionals, caregivers, relatives, neighbors, and friends) have been involved in the healthcare process. The collaboration among them can supply more information to help making correct decision and taking action timely. However, it is a challenge to achieving an effective collaborative healthcare among multiple parities with individual knowledge, located in different places, operating in different time, and doing not know each other even. For addressing the challenges in collaborative healthcare, this paper proposes an ontology-based semantic collaborative healthcare approach to supporting and enhancing the living of the elderly people. This approach achieves the semantic collaboration by exploiting the knowledge about the elderly, healthcare related information tuple, and the users including professional, relatives and so on. Ontology is utilized to model and represent such kinds of knowledge. A tuplespace-based coordination model is adopted to support the cooperation among different parities at anytime and anywhere with anybody.

abstract={Visual Sensor Networks (VSNs) open up a new realm of smart autonomous applications based on enhanced three-dimensional sensing and collaborative reasoning. An emerging VSN application domain is pervasive healthcare delivery where gait information computed from distributed vision nodes is used for observing the wellbeing of the elderly, quantifying post-operative patient recovery and monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. The development of patient-specific gait analysis models, however, is challenging since it is unfeasible to obtain normal and impaired gait examples from the same patient before the operation in order to build supervised models for gait classification. This paper presents a novel VSN-based framework for quantification of patient-specific gait impairment and post-operative recovery by using change analysis. Real-time target extraction is first applied to VSN data and a skeletonization procedure is subsequently carried out to quantify the internal motion of moving target and compute two features; spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory for each vision node. Change analysis is then used to measure the change, i.e. difference, between two unlabeled datasets collected pre- and post-operatively and quantify gait changes. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient gait monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

Furthermore, it is going to use medical data from vital signs for, on one hand, the detection of symptoms using a rule system based on Jess (tachycardia, arrhythmia ...) and, on the other hand, the prediction of illness using chronobiology algorithms. This paper proposes a knowledge base to represent general human information, heart details and electrocardiogram parameters based on ontologies and a Jess' rule system to detect anomalies and patterns from electrocardiogram information.

The key idea of this study is to leverage their presence by collecting the received signal strength (RSS) measured among fixed devices, deployed in the environment, and the wearable one. The RSS measurements are used to classify a set of user's positions in the bed, monitoring the activities of patients unable to make the desirable bodily movements.

abstract={Determining the location of individuals within indoor locations can be useful in various scenarios including security, gaming and ambient assisted living for the elderly. Healthcare services globally are seeking to allow people to stay in their familiar home environments longer due to the multitude of benefits associated with living in non-clinical environments. Technology to determine an individual's movements or lack of movement is key to ensuring that home emergencies are detected and responded to promptly. This paper proposes a device-free wireless-based localisation (DFL) system which would enable the individual to proceed with normal daily activities without the constraint of having to wear a traceable device. The principal behind this is that the human body absorbs/reflects the radio signal being transmitted from a transmitter to one or more receiving stations. The system design procedure facilitates the use of a minimum number of wireless nodes with the aid of a principle component analysis (PCA) based intelligent signal processing technique. Results demonstrate that human detection and tracking are possible to within 1m resolutions with a minimal wireless hardware infrastructure.},

abstract={Pervasive healthcare solution for medication noncompliance problem would help to save $177 billion annually in the United States. And the rapidly increasing demanding of daily monitoring with onsite diagnosis and prognosis is driving homecare solutions to integrate more and more sensing and data processing capacities. So a powerful system is needed not only to address the medication noncompliance but also to be used as a pervasive healthcare station in home. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive healthcare solution for medication noncompliance and daily monitoring is proposed using an intelligent package sealed by controlled delamination material (CDM) and controlled by radio frequency identification (RFID). Onsite diagnosis and prognosis capacities for kinds of health parameters are supported due to scalable and intensive computing capacitance of the 2D-Mesh-NoC based multi-core architecture. Additionally, friendly human-machine interface is emphasized to make it usable for the elderly, disabled and patients due to enhanced multimedia performance. Experimental results of an implemented prototype confirmed the necessity of the multi-core architecture and approved the feasibility of the proposed intelligent package.},

Then, the locations are modeled as trajectories according to the spatial-temporal relationship between locations. The mining phase utilizes different strategies to discover diverse types of behavior patterns by observing long-term regular routines. Therefore, we can mine valuable knowledge from monitor-dependent people's life style and regularity, which makes sense to supply the accessment of life activity measurement, the suggestion of healthy life mode, etc., for the domiciliary elderly.},

abstract={Accidental falls of our elderly, and physical injuries resulting, represent a major health and economic. Falls are the most common causes of serious injuries and a major health threats in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to the elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by a static wireless nonintrusive sensorial infrastructure based on heterogenous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure, named AID (Alarm Intelligent Device), is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. We have developed, different to other contributions, a specific low-power multi-hop network consists of nodes (Motes) that wirelessly communicate to each other and are capable of hopping radio messages to a base station where they are passed to a PC (or other possible client). The goal of this project is 1) to provide alerts to caregivers in the event of an accident, acute illness or strange (possibly dangerous) activities, and 2) to enable that authorized and authenticated caregivers by means of a itinerant wearable mote can be inserted into mesh and interact with it. In this paper, we describe an ubiquitous assistential monitoring system at home.},

abstract={Falling is a major risk to the health and quality of life for the elderly and for those with vestibular impairment. Virtual environments have been investigated in the past for their potential for vestibular rehabilitation. In this study, a low cost, off-the-shelf virtual reality game was evaluated for user head movements. Two levels of difficulty were used in the training, conducted in five sessions over the course of one week. Subjects felt very immersed in the environment and game performance increased gradually. Lateral head movements were recorded consistently throughout the training period and between difficulty levels, with a range of 60Â° left and right. Performance on standard balance tests after training also showed improvement. This suggests that this readily available virtual reality game could be used in balance rehabilitation.},

abstract={Self care is a recent initiative by the Department of Health in the UK that aims to treat patients with long-term conditions sooner, nearer to home and earlier in the course of their disease. To this end, it places the point-of-care in the community and often at the patients' own home. In this paper we discuss the building blocks of pervasive self care, a ubiquitous computing service infrastructure that can play a critical role in supporting patients with long tern conditions to manage their case. This service employs computing elements embedded in the home environment and the body so as to provide context-aware case management. The proposed architecture brings together islands of pervasive computing functionality into an integrated end-to-end architecture. In doing so, it aims to introduce a generic reference model for the delivery of pervasive self-care services that can help limit the considerable amount of duplication in current work in this field},

abstract={Telecare is a term that covers a range of products and services that use new technology to enable people to live with greater independence and safety in their own homes. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the user experience of a familiar telecare product called a `personal trigger' that provides a means of summoning assistance when help is needed. It is supplied as part of a community alarm service and should be worn at all times for continuous protection. Our evaluation is based on a survey distributed to over 1,300 clients in Moray, North East Scotland with a 60% response rate. The main findings are: clients view the service extremely positively, but almost two-thirds have never used their personal trigger to summon help and less than 8% wear it at all times; over two-thirds of clients wear their personal trigger most or all of the time, predominantly because it makes them feel safer; almost one-third of clients wear their personal trigger only some of the time to not at all, mostly because it is too sensitive or they forget to put it on. The appearance of the personal trigger was found to be less significant, despite the large majority of respondents being women. However, there is a need for better design to make it more comfortable and enjoyable to wear. Over the coming years, many older people will have higher expectations of public services. Designers can make things that are attractive and work well, and should be included in teams that develop telecare technology.},

abstract={In this paper we describe a wearable ubiquitous healthcare monitoring system that integrates electrocardiogram (ECG device) and an accelerometer sensor with a mobile device in a Bluetooth-based body surface network (BSN).

The main aim of this research was the early detection of abnormal situations (high/low HR, a fall) and the heart rate variability analysis. The human falls are very risky events that occur not only in the elderly people's daily living but also by epileptics and asthmatics. For these people independent living is strictly forbidden. A wearable sensor based monitoring system can inhibit serious injuries and allow those people live an independent life. Additionally, an SMS messaging module was integrated with the monitoring system. After detecting a non-standard situation a short notice is sent. The implementation of the QRS complex detection algorithm, that was based on the Tompkins formula, was tested on the records from the MIT-BIH database.},

abstract={As humans are being progressively pushed further downstream in the decision-making process of autonomous systems, the need arises to ensure that moral standards, however defined, are adhered to by these robotic artifacts. While meaningful inroads have been made in this area regarding the use of ethical lethal military robots, including work by our laboratory, these needs transcend the warfighting domain and are pervasive, extending to eldercare, robot nannies, and other forms of service and entertainment robotic platforms. This paper presents an overview of the spectrum and specter of ethical issues raised by the advent of these systems, and various technical results obtained to date by our research group, geared towards managing ethical behavior in autonomous robots in relation to humanity. This includes: 1) the use of an ethical governor capable of restricting robotic behavior to predefined social norms; 2) an ethical adaptor which draws upon the moral emotions to allow a system to constructively and proactively modify its behavior based on the consequences of its actions; 3) the development of models of robotic trust in humans and its dual, deception, drawing on psychological models of interdependence theory; and 4) concluding with an approach towards the maintenance of dignity in human-robot relationships.},

abstract={Game design demands a comprehensive understanding of the audience. Although recent developments in the video game industry have heightened the need to involve players in the design process, the research to date has tended to focus on participatory design with children rather than older adults. Moreover, due to the lack of information regarding gamers' social context and their experiences, there has been little agreement on whether video games with a multiplayer dimension are suitable for this age group. Through online and face-to-face group workshops with five experienced and five novice gamers aged 50 and over, we discuss the potential of social network games for older adults and the main game design components, which can encourage them to play. The results of this study suggest that a player versus environment (PvE) mode is preferred to player versus player (PvP) games and that collaboration between players should be prioritized over competition. This target also seems to prefer off-game communication tools to extend their virtual relationships.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is a new subfield of robotics that bridges human-robot interaction (HRI), rehabilitation robotics, social robotics, and service robotics. SAR focuses on developing machines capable of assisting users, typically in health and education contexts, through social rather than physical interaction. The robot's physical embodiment is at the heart of SAR's effectiveness, as it leverages the inherently human tendency to engage with lifelike (but not necessarily humanlike or otherwise biomimetic) social behavior. This talk will describe research into embodiment, modeling and steering social dynamics, and long-term user adaptation for SAR. The research will be grounded in projects involving analysis of multi-modal activity data, modeling personality and engagement, formalizing social use of space and non-verbal communication, and personalizing the interaction with the user over a period of months. The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated by human subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.},

abstract={A new paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare characterized by pervasive continuous vital sign data collection, real-time processing of monitored data to derive meaningful physiological parameters, and context-aware data- and patient-centric decision making, is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, this article presents an innovative resource provisioning framework that organizes and harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., laptops, tablets, PDAs, DVRs, medical terminals) in home and hospital settings. Novel wireless communication solutions for reliable vital sign transmission and algorithms for acquiring context awareness to support this framework are also discussed.},

abstract={Smart environments have progressed and evolved into a significant research area with development of sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning strategies. Ambient Intelligence incorporated into smart environment assists in resolving many social related applications to facilitate the future society. The initiative of modeling Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in smart homes have helped in the deployment of applications to various domains like elderly care, health care etc. Activity recognition is the task involved in reasoning within smart homes with the aim of recognizing the ongoing activity of the occupant. Constructing an activity model is essential to carry out recognition and is achieved through various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Data driven approach constructs activity model through statistical machine learning mechanisms while knowledge driven approach constructs activity model through knowledge representation and modeling strategies. Uncertainty and temporal data are better handled by data driven approach while re-usability and context based analysis is handled better by knowledge driven approach of activity modeling. To combine the features of data driven and knowledge driven approaches, a hybrid activity modeling technique is required. The proposed system performs activity modeling via Markov Logic Network, a machine learning strategy that combines probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning with a single framework. Activities in a smart home are categorized as simple and composite activities, wherein composite activities are defined as related simple activities within a given time interval. The proposed system models both simple and composite activity using soft and hard rules of MLN. Experiments carried over the proposed system shows the effectiveness of the proposed work for recognizing simple and composite activity.},

abstract={The increasing number of elderly citizens in our society increases the strain on traditional healthcare systems' resources. Ambient Assisted Living solutions seek to reduce the impact of this trend as well as provide a way for the elderly to continue living in their home environment as long as possible with a good quality of life and independence. However, due to the diverse nature of existing products and services, ensuring interoperability between them is important to provide flexible and adequate solutions for an individual's particular needs. The goal of this work is to propose a solution for this problem using Electronic Health Records and health information standards. For this purpose, a repository was implemented to store records in Extensible Markup Language format following the openEHR standard, as well as an application to create, manage and query these records. An interface engine was used to provide message transformation capabilities between different standards and openEHR. The results gathered from an evaluation of this work show that such a system provides fast insertion of information and reasonable querying times for single records. Also, the message transformation capabilities developed in conjunction with the storage mechanism provide an important step towards solving the interoperability problem.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.},

abstract={The changes of medical environments such as the growth of a patient with a chronic disease and the elderly, and the advance of the IT technology require highly qualified medical service of new paradigm. For the reason, home health management service has been focused with much expectations and interests. Our proposed home health management system (H2MS) monitors and manages daily physiological status which is easily acquired from multiple-sensor based ubiquitous bio-signal sensor during sleeping, bathing, evacuating, and living at home. H2MS is largely consisted of four functional subsystems: multiple-sensor based ubiquitous bio-signal sensor, home health intermediary client (H2IC), home health center (H2C), and home health service provider (H2SP). Each subsystem carried out their own processes and collaborated on a work with each other. H2MS provides various home health services for the wellness, as well as the elderly, chronic patient's illness, or terminal illness. Also, it is available to suggest various services: an early warning service according to the change of health status, advice service for health improvement, and appointment service for medical treatment. Moreover, this early warning service makes promptly emergency repairs as soon as occurrence of physiologically abnormal symptom. Consequently, early warning reports reduce the frequent intervention of high costed service of medical professionals.},

abstract={Home-bound patients, mostly elders face many problems regarding their critical health parameter variations and timely assistance in case of emergencies. It is really a malady when they suffer from other severe diseases, heart problems etc. A constant and reliable assistive technology is essential while taking care of homebound patients. The system, HOPE we have proposed has sensors to monitor the heart rate, body temperature, tilt and fall. The sensors are attached to the body of the elderly patient in a contented manner. The data can be sent to any Smartphone with Bluetooth support. In case of any emergency the caretaker will be given a notification about the critical situation. The provision to monitor the posture of the patient in the bed helps to reduce the cases of bedsore in bedridden elders. Day by day the menace of weakening health and chances of skin related problems, bed sores etc. are becoming critical in case of bed ridden patients. The experimental results presented in this paper give some insight into the behavior of the proposed system.},

In particular a reliable fall detector is presented, with focus on the protection and assistance to the elderly in the home environment. The integrated fall detector prototype includes two different sensors: a 3D Time-of-Flight range camera and a wearable MEMS accelerometer. The devices are connected in a networked configuration with custom interface circuits to a central PC that collects and processes the information with a multi-threading approach. For each sensor, an optimized algorithm for fall-detection has been developed and benchmarked on a collected multimodal database. This work is expected to lead to a multi-sensory approach employing appropriate fusion techniques aiming to improve system efficiency and reliability.},

abstract={A major practical problem when implementing home monitoring using 3D camera technology is the calibration process which serves to relate the camera coordinate system to a coordinate system interpretable by the caregiver. In this paper, we propose a calibration algorithm which can relate both coordinate systems without performing actual measurements of the position of reference points in the room. The calibration tool is constructed such that it can be operated by any caregiver and hence eases the deployment of the home monitoring appliances. Our method (semi)automatically detects a plane corresponding to the ground floor in the three dimensional images. Random points from that plane are used to calculate rotation angles in a least squares manner. Experiments are performed to investigate how the obtained results depend on the parameters of the algorithm.},

abstract={As robotic technologies of varying shapes and forms continue to make their way into our everyday lives, the significance of a humanoid robot's ability to make a human interaction feel natural, engaging and entertaining becomes an area of keen interest in sociable robotics. In this paper, we present our findings on how affective feedback can be used to drive reinforcement learning in human-robot interactions (HRI) and other dialogue systems. We implemented a system where a humanoid robot, named ZOEI, acts as a standup comedian by entertaining a human audience in a bid to generate humor and positively influence the emotional state of the humans. The mood rating of the audience is recorded prior to the interaction session. Using a survey, the eventual emotional state of the human participant is captured after the HRI session. For each audience member, we capture feedback regarding how funny each joke was. We present the implementation of the content selection framework. We share our findings to substantiate the idea that by using expressive behaviors of the humanoid to influence the delivery of content (in this case, jokes) as well as employing reinforcement learning techniques for driving targeted content selection, the robot was able to improve the human mood score progressively across the 16 people who engaged in the study.},

pages={40-44}, 
abstract={Ambient assisted living (AAL) applications are intended to allow elderly people to stay at home while connected to their family and medical staff. These applications involve several services as health-care services or infotainment, which are executed on different environments such as hospital, proximity doctor, family homes. These environments constitute a distributed, heterogeneous, highly dynamic infrastructure that makes it necessary to build AAL applications as adaptive software including the necessary mechanisms to dynamically modify their behavior. In this paper we propose a multi-level model to build context-aware self-adaptive entities: the basic level defines the mandatory functionalities for adaptive entities, while upper-levels define how to coordinate adaptation of primitive or composite entities. The generic nature of the model is illustrated by its use when building a self-adaptive distributed data management service for an AAL application.},

abstract={The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, like many other public health services worldwide, is facing a number of key challenges. Among them are an ageing population and a rising incidence of chronic health conditions. This situation requires a radical re-examination of how people manage their health and their healthcare in ways that challenge the relationship between people and healthcare services. Combining this observation with the opportunities afforded by pervasive information and communication technologies, we argue that design research should reach beyond simply locating devices and services to offer healthcare `in the home' and should examine this broader agenda. Rather than focussing design discourse on the specifics of one location, we should adopt a holistic view, beginning from people's lived experience. In this position paper we describe the User-Centred Healthcare Design (UCHD) project, 5-year collaboration between universities and NHS Trusts in South Yorkshire, UK. We suggest that new models of healthcare that re-define the institutional and social context of care are required if we are to meet the challenge of chronic illness. We describe our progress to date on the UCHD project, our commitment to placing patient experience at the centre of design, and our initial experiences of using an experience-based co-design method to improve outpatient services in a Sheffield hospital.},

year={2008}, 
pages={375-380}, 
abstract={Tripping and slipping falls are serious health concerns for the elderly because they incur high medical costs and can result in life threatening injuries i.e., internal bleeding. Recently there has been an increased interest in the development of portable inertial sensing devices for measuring human movement. These devices employ acceleration and angular data to obtain limb motion such as velocity and displacement through integration of acceleration values. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a wireless inertial sensing device for monitoring vertical toe clearance during walking. It has been demonstrated that variability in minimum toe clearance (MTC) which occurs during the swing phase is a sensitive falls risk predictor. Our device is composed of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope wirelessly connected through the use of Crossbow motes. The vertical toe clearance is obtained through double integration of the resultant acceleration in the vertical direction. We have performed zero base, treadmill and intersubject experiments to investigate device performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20 m indoors and 50 m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements coincided with Optotrak measurement trends but suffered from cumulative integration errors over time. The identification, quantification and reduction of these errors are intricate but important further research issues.},

abstract={An intelligent femtocell-based sensor network is proposed for home monitoring elderly or people with chronic diseases. The femtocell is considered as a small sensor network which is placed into patient house and consists on both mobile and fixed sensors disposed on three layers. The first layer contains body sensors attached to the patient that monitor different health parameters, patient location, position and possible falls. The second layer is dedicated for ambient sensors and routing inside the cell. The third layer contains emergency ambient sensors that cover burglary events or toxic gas concentration, distributed by necessities. Cell implementation is based on IRIS family of motes. In order to reduce energy consumption and radiation level, adaptive rates of acquisition and communication are used. Experimental results on body sensors and ambient ones are presented in the last section.},

abstract={The ubiquity of smartphones together with their ever-growing computing, networking, and sensing powers have been changing the landscape of people's daily life. Among others, activity recognition, which takes the raw sensor reading as inputs and predicts a user's motion activity, has become an active research area in recent years. It is the core building block in many high-impact applications, ranging from health and fitness monitoring, personal biometric signature, urban computing, assistive technology, and elder-care, to indoor localization and navigation, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent advances in activity recognition with smartphones' sensors. We start with the basic concepts such as sensors, activity types, etc. We review the core data mining techniques behind the main stream activity recognition algorithms, analyze their major challenges, and introduce a variety of real applications enabled by activity recognition.},

abstract={The paper describes a real-time adaptive battery model for use in an all-electric personal rapid transit vehicle. Whilst traditionally, circuit-based models for lead-acid batteries centre on the well-known Randles' model, here the Randles' model is mapped to an equivalent circuit, demonstrating improved modelling capabilities and more accurate estimates of circuit parameters when used in Subspace parameter estimation techniques. Combined with Kalman Estimator algorithms, these techniques are demonstrated to correctly identify and converge on voltages associated with the battery State-of-Charge, overcoming problems such as SoC drift (incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over-charging or ambient temperature fluctuations). Online monitoring of the degradation of these estimated parameters allows battery ageing (State-of-Health) to be assessed and, in safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Due to the adaptive nature of the proposed methodology, this system can be implemented over a wide range of operating environments, applications and battery topologies.},

abstract={AAL applications that support users (in particular, the elderly and patients) in staying at home are increasingly becoming popular in health care systems. Basically, these AAL applications provide personal information through location-aware, data-aware, and context-aware heterogeneous devices such as sensors and actuators. Obviously, due to this heterogeneity, it is very important to study the asynchronous flow scheduling problem. This article designs a simple but efficient asynchronous flow scheduling scheme aiming to sense, predict, and realize AAL applications. Specifically, the scheduling architecture is developed by analyzing various device characteristics and user activities, and the corresponding applications are classified from user needs aspects. Subsequently, we propose asynchronous flow scheduling taking into account energy efficiency and implementation simplicity. Detailed discussions of the proposed system and possible future research directions are provided.},

abstract={Owing to the significant scale of the aging population and the cost involved, efforts for driving quality lifestyle of the elderly is crucial. Recently, eCare (electronic care) has been an important issue of health care that utilizes the Web technologies to improve the quality of health care. However, existing aging services (health care or eCare) are mostly oriented to clinical gerontology or neurophysiology of aging. This paper devises a novel notion called iCare (intelligent care) which extends eCare (electronic care) technologies to a domain of ambient e-services that meet the desired quality elements. The objective of iCare is to provide quality e-services to the elderly people anywhere and anytime. We also present the iCare e-services framework that comprises an iCare e-service ontology and an e-service provision quality model. This framework also implies a future roadmap of quality-aging e-services that can be particularly accounted as affectionate technologies.},

Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), SF-8 (Quality Metric), was used to measure and to compare before and after the intervention in both groups. ANCOVA in SPSS 18.0 was used to analyze the data. Results of HRQOL showed that general health, physical function, role physical, and body pain in physical component summary and social functioning in mental component summary were significantly improved after the intervention. The study concluded that somatosensory video games had a great potential to be used as a health promotion tool for the elderly with disabilities. Case studies and qualitative approaches in further researches were suggested to understand the efficacy of this SVG intervention and to design individualized technology-based intervention programs for the elderly with special needs to promote their optimal health.},

abstract={Incontinence is highly prevalent in Patients with Dementia (PWD) due to a decline in their physical and mental abilities. Those PWD may lie in soiled diaper for prolonged periods if timely diaper change is not in place. Current manual care practices may not be able to immediately detect soiled diaper, although costly and labor intensive scheduled checks are performed. Delays in diaper change can cause serious social and medical issues. So, timely and effective continence management is important to potentially avoid the undesirable consequences. By developing assistive system leveraging on sensors, wireless sensor network, ambient intelligence and reminders, it is feasible to detect soiled diaper and remind the carers for timely intervention. With around the clock sensing, distributed monitoring and context-aware intervention, timely diaper change is possible anywhere anytime without wasting unnecessary care-giving resources and without causing annoyances to the elderly.},

abstract={The increasing cost of healthcare represents a serious challenge to most developed countries. Telehealth has been widely promoted as a technology to make healthcare more effective and affordable. However, current telehealth systems suffer from vendor lock-in and high cost, and are designed for managing chronic diseases, rather than preventing them. In this paper we evaluate technologies for supporting senior health consumers. Based on this we propose a framework for a novel telehealth system overcoming many of the shortcomings of existing technologies. The new system is web-based, has a Facebook-like plug-in architecture for adding new health applications, and incorporates social networking functionalities. We discuss the challenges in implementing the system, and summarize a user study evaluating the system. Our results demonstrate that health consumers have a positive view of this new telehealth technology, and that it can positively change the attitude of users towards their health.},

abstract={In his ACM Computers in Entertainment article, titled "Artist and Audience: Emerging the Nano-entertainment experience" [1], the author posited on how Inhabited Information Spaces, created as core catalyst of research, may be questioned as a multisensory future virtual work of art. This themed Human-Computer Interaction for Entertainment contribution for the EAI INTETAIN 2015 conference builds upon the earlier work by questioning meaning making from such self-active entertainment experiences. Contextually, self-active relates to actor empowerment via ICT, whilst entertainment refers to HCI paradigms that are fun, engaging, and enjoyable. Conceptualizing, designing and realizing alternative digital media entertainment situations in stage performance, interactive installations and exhibitions at leading Museums for Modern Art, National and International major events, contributed to development of a sensor-based system conceived as a platform to investigate meaning making having societal impact beyond art. The system involves arrays of selectable sensor profiles mixed and matched according to requirements. Sensing of human input can be through worn (biosignal e.g. EEG, ECG, EMG, GSR), held, and/or non-worn sensors (volumetric, linear and planar interface profiles). Mapping of sourced human data is to a variety of digital content including art-based (music making, digital painting, lighting effects), video games, Virtual Reality and robotic devices. System adaptability promotes participant profile matching e.g. according to desired outcome. All ages and abilities are potential users., eceding the commonly known camera-based game controllers such as EyeToy, Wii, and Kinect; the SoundScapes Virtual Interactive Space [2] system has been used in institutes, hospitals and clinics to empower people with impairment to unconsciously push their limits of functionality via creative and playful expression. Rehabilitation is less mundane and boring, where variety of ICT-based inte- vention motivates whilst offering creative opportunities for facilitators. Additionally, in a randomized intervention study with frail elderly patients, Hagedorn and Holm reported significant clinical rehabilitation impact up to 400% in the ICT feedback training specific performance [3]. This work highlights how co-informing paradigms between computer and human science and art, games and healthcare, can result in societal impact as well as commercial patented product and industry start-ups. At the core of the research is a rethinking in the way a human interacts with ICT. Current research explores a concept of dynamic air and alternative physical-virtual environments. Conclusions introduce a suggested need of increased researcher awareness of post-research effect following intervention/trials within healthcare and rehabilitation.},

abstract={There has been a very rapid growth in wearable computers over the past few years. Assisted living applications leveraging wearable computers will enable a healthier lifestyle and independence in a variety of target populations, including those suffering from neurological disorders, patients in need of rehabilitation after surgical procedures or injury, the elderly, individuals who might be at high risk of emotional stress, and those who are looking for a healthier lifestyle. Application paradigms for assisted living include activities of daily living (ADLs) monitoring, indoor localization, emergency and fall detection, and rehabilitation. All of these applications require monitoring of movements and physical activities for individuals. Wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based sensors can offer low-cost and ubiquitous monitoring solutions for physical activities. Signal processing techniques with a focus on enhancing accuracy, lowering computational complexity, reducing power consumption, and improving the unobtrusiveness of the wearable computers are of interest in this article, which constitutes the first attempt made at reviewing the literature of wearable IMU-based signal processing techniques for assisted living applications.

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a field of research activities focusing on IT support for healthcare, comfort and control applications for private home environments and seniors that has gained importance over the last years. AAL facilities often require positioning services, and generally need to offer easy installation and low energy consumption. We present an approach based on an ultrasound and RF system for three-dimensional indoor positioning and tracking using wall-mounted anchor nodes and a mobile positioning target. The target is a multifunctional customized handheld display and input device connected to the AAL environment. Positioning is achieved using TDoA distance measurement and a multilateration algorithm. To fulfill the low energy requirement, wall nodes are woken up only for positioning cycles by an ultrasonic pulse decoded by a custom electronic circuit and RF traffic is modelled with a small protocol footprint.},

abstract={The development of ambient assisted living (AAL) systems, which are tailored to health or elder care, requires specific methods and tools. AAL systems make often use of wireless sensor networks, machine learning algorithms and sensory devices. Since wireless sensor networks and their sensors are inhomogeneous, it became apparent that such systems need to cope with different hardware platforms, different programming languages, unreliable wireless communication, energy constraints, data analysis algorithms, recognition of situations, and deployment options. Developers to date tend to use a bottom-up approach: hardware components dictate the development of AAL systems and thereby restrict the range of use cases that can be realized; domain experts by contrast would prefer a top-down approach and model the systempsilas functionality independently from the hardware platform. Currently available software development environments and tools do not adequately support domain experts and developers to accomplish these tasks efficiently. This paper presents methods that support domain experts in their top-down approach, as well as technically experienced developers in their bottom-up approach. The implemented tools enable a model-driven software development process (from platform-independent modeling to generating AAL application code) and thus facilitate programming AAL systems.},

abstract={Incontinence is one of the major healthcare issues in everyday nursing care especially for frail elderly and patients with dementia (PWD) in nursing homes. Urinary incontinence and diaper use are prevalent in PWD due to decline in intellect and physical activities. They may lie in soiled diapers for prolonged periods resulting in indignity, discomfort, skin breakdowns and bedsores. In order to alleviate this, we propose a solution using wetness alert diaper capable of timely diaper change. In this paper, the experiences and lessons learned from initial evaluation trials with intelligent Continence Management System (iCMSv1) are explained. Then, desirable refinements and extensions are made to develop iCMSv2 enabling anywhere anytime continence management. We finally discuss challenges and possible future directions towards developing a new care model to manage incontinence effectively and efficiently.},

abstract={Building a cyber-physical system consisting of many reactive elements that continually interact with each other may require considerable efforts to ensure that it behaves as desired. The scale of the issues to tackle is much expanded when it comprises human-factors to analyze and change (e.g persuasion). In this paper, a development methodology is proposed for building the kind of system that developer interacts and communicates directly with the components in the domain. The developer interacts with them in simulated or runtime context in order to instruct and shape the whole system. As a technique of Agent-Based Modeling, the entire system is considered to consist of interacting (semi-) autonomous agents that can reason, adapt, and learn at runtime. This approach of development requires a particular agent architecture that can reason and learn about human activity and social conditions comprising spatial, temporal, and hierarchical structure of information. In this paper, the teachable approach is exemplified using a simulated persuasive multi-agent system for elderly care in ageing-in-place domain.},

abstract={This paper proposes a serious game for the elderly that allows for the enjoyment of scenic views while walking in the room. The proposed game employs hand buttons and footboards based on a PC as controllers. The game is intended to provide the elderly with physical satisfaction through cooperation and competition, entertainment such as vital power, and opportunities to maintain mental functions through games. To test the efficacy of the game, we considered a sample of 309 elderly individuals who were more than 65 years old and resided in Cheonan City. The results indicated that 76.1% of the participants were fully satisfied with the game, rating it 4.13 out of 5. In addition, 89.4% were willing to play the game again. These results suggest that the intended permissiveness and coenesthesia of the game may be appealing to the elderly.},

abstract={Elders who live alone are vulnerable population at risk. Despite telemedicine and clinical home monitoring are effective to provide health care, accidents at home are still one of the major risk factors. Important efforts have been done in home monitoring systems to detect potential scenarios of risk. However, the complex technological interaction has a negative impact on the user and intrusive or wearable devices are not recommended. Sensorized houses solve this problem, recording the behaviour of elders at home without a direct interaction. However, the detection of health-risk scenarios is a complex issue, since the large amount temporal data registered by sensors must be correctly interpreted. In such a case, Artificial Intelligence techniques have been used to automatically identify abnormal behaviors. Due to the number false positives of these techniques, the human intervention is still necessary. We consider that a semiautomatic approach, abstracting and visualizing the recorded temporal information, is a more suitable approach. In this work, we propose a specialised visualization model that helps system supervisors to identify through visual mining techniques most common scenarios of risk. We illustrate our proposal in a specific home monitoring system.},

In this paper, we employed mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to represent the Doppler signatures of various human activities such as walking, bending down, falling, etc. Then we used two different classifiers, SVM and kNN, to automatically detect falls based on the extracted MFCC features. We obtained encouraging classification results on a pilot dataset that contained 109 falls and 341 non-fall human activities.},

Dynamic vision detectors consist of self-signaling pixels that autonomously react to scene dynamics and asynchronously generate events upon relative light intensity change. Their complete on-chip redundancy reduction, wide dynamic range and high temporal resolution allow efficient and continuous activity monitoring in natural environment. Using a stereo pair of dynamic vision detectors, it is possible to represent the scene dynamics in a 4D space (including time) at a high temporal resolution. In this work, we performed 100 recordings of scenarios including falls in indoor environment using this dynamic stereo vision sensor. Seven features have been extracted and analyzed for three types of falls such that robust parameters will be kept for fall recognition. The result of this analysis is shown in this work with promising outcomes.},

abstract={Ageing is a major global demographic trend, which seems to be intensified. The earlier detection of risks associated with ageing, can enable earlier intervention to ameliorate their negative consequences. Many of these recent efforts are associated with the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the stemming from them innovations in the fight against this age related decline and frailty. Ubiquitous unobtrusive monitoring and training (recently much blended by means of exergames) has become reality due to the availability of new mobile sensors and devices and the emergence of new technologies and services. The current piece of work presents the different milestones we have achieved as best practices during the past seven years of piloting training and exergaming ICT components in an effort to support Active and Healthy Aging. Our impact verification and results validation methodologies are revisited here in an effort to outline best practices and build up neuroscientific evidence. Finally, this paper demonstrates how the construction of an Active and Healthy Aging Living Lab was materialised in an attempt to gauge evidence based research in the field of active and health aging.},

Subsequently, linear discriminant analysis was shown to predict participants suffering from increased anxiety and loneliness with a high accuracy (≥70%). While the number of participants is small, this study reports that objective ambient features may be used to infer clinically validated health metrics.

pages={335-344}, 
abstract={Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous opportunities for the implementation of ubiquitous health care systems in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against abnormal conditions. This helps with the automatic and remote monitoring/tracking of patients in hospitals and facilitates and with the supervision of fragile, elderly people in their own domestic environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug delivery. This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for the multipatient positioning in a wireless body area network (WBAN) which exploits the spatial sparsity of patients and a sparse fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based feature extraction mechanism for monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a central database server containing patient vital information. The main goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and resolution in the patient localization with less computational complexity in the implementation using the compressive sensing theory. We represent the patients' positions as a sparse vector obtained by the discrete segmentation of the patient movement space in a circular grid. To estimate this vector, a compressive-sampling-based two-level FFT (CS-2FFT) feature vector is synthesized for each received signal from the biosensors embedded on the patient's body at each grid point. This feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both short-time and long-time properties of the received signals. The robustness of the proposed CS-2FFT-based algorithm in terms of the average positioning error is numerically evaluated using the realistic parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6-WBAN standard in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the circular grid pattern and the CS-2FFT feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a significant reduction in the computational complexity, while improving the level of the resolut- on and the localization accuracy when compared to some classical CS-based positioning algorithms.},

abstract={Demographic changes worldwide are generating aged populations that bring sustainability challenges to the healthcare and social care systems. Therefore solutions that provide elderly citizens the chance to remain at their homes surrounded by an environment that takes care of them are needed. To support such environment the development of an ecosystem of products and services for Ambient Assisted Living is being carried out within the context of the AAL4ALL project. The provision of care and assistance services requires collaboration of multiple stakeholders which implies, under a socio-technical perspective, mechanisms for organization, governance and collaboration support among them. In this context, this paper presents an approach for modeling the management of such ecosystem using the i* modeling framework.},

title={Human activity recognition supporting context-appropriate reminders for elderly}, 
year={2009}, 
pages={1-4}, 
abstract={Dementia affects large number of elderly, manifested with memory impairment symptoms at the onset. This results in difficulties for elderly in scheduling and completing daily activities. In this respect a context-aware reminder system becomes an essential tool in helping elderly navigate their daily activities. Current work on reminder systems typically follows a set of pre-defined activities, organised into a plan. The plan is then used to prompt the elderly to execute specific activities or actions if they have not been completed. However, this is less than an ideal scheme, since the elderly sometimes choose to ignore the reminders due to being engaged in other activities that overlap with the scheduled activities. Therefore, a more flexible schedule is required, that delivers reminders in a context-appropriate manner. Such system must take into account not only the planned activities, but also the current activities of the elderly. We address this problem by monitoring the activities of the elder through our activity recognition system and using this information as a feedback to the reminder system. The reminder system can then decide whether a reminder prompt is appropriate to be delivered or should it be postponed for at a later time. We present the results of activity recognition and discuss how they affect the context-appropriate reminder system.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Health services are today facing a number of interacting challenges. It is generally accepted that major, even radical, changes are required in health services to deliver better health outcomes at an affordable cost. IT is a change driver both in the horizontal and vertical directions. Horizontally we see the emergence and extension of a generic IT infrastructure that eventually will allow anytime, anywhere access to information and knowledge and context aware decision making. In the vertical direction IT enables a more effective and efficient health service environment. Standards and guidelines for an interoperable electronic patient record (EPR) have been developed and are today endorsed by industry and governments. Several countries are investing into a nation-wide "backbone" for health information and EPR exchange. The creation of the "backbone" allows separating data from processes. It's the processes (services) where the biggest potential and challenge is for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health services. Another change driver is the expansion of (traditional) healthcare into a "health continuum" with the aim to engage and empower people to proactively manage their health and illness. This extends to the ageing people that can be assisted with tools and services to remain independent and integrated with the society. A third driver is the integration of medicine, life sciences, and engineering and physical sciences. These drivers point towards an application landscape that is characterized by "3 P's": pervasive, personal and personalized. In the keynote, we define what these three P's contain and how they relate to each other.},

number={1}, 
pages={31-42}, 
abstract={The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the virtual reality version of the Multiple Errands Test based on NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 10), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline.},

abstract={Aging is associated with changing physical, social, emotional, and financial circumstances that are often new to the elder. The affective distress that stems from coping with them could play a negative effect on the health of seniors and lead to severe cases of depression, an emotional disorder that could lead to fatal consequences. The combination of novel methods of ambulatory detection of emotional states, body area networks providing information from numerous bodily parameters, and sophisticated pervasive technologies offers new possibilities in the detection of and intervention in cases of subclinical depression. In this paper we present the technical aspects and rationale behind systems that can use emotional valence monitoring to quantify prolonged emotional negativity and identify the activities associated with such negativity. We argue that this as a suitable mechanism to facilitate ambient-mediated self-regulation and remote peer-support.},

year={2012}, 
pages={572-577}, 
abstract={Adaptation decisions made by context-aware applications on behalf of users are based on evaluations of current context and preferences of users. This context information is imperfect by nature and can cause applications to behave in ways that users do not expect. Applications that exhibit unwanted behaviour will negatively impact their usability and violate the trust users have in them. Intelligibility and control in applications can help users to understand why they decided to behave in certain ways, and to forgive the applications by enabling users to override the undesirable adaptation. This paper presents a non-monotonic rule based approach (defeasible logic) for modelling user preferences, which serves as the basis of decision-making of application adaptations. It facilitates automatic generation of explanations regarding reasoning of defeasible preferences. The model also supports creation of feedback mechanisms for nontechnical users to formulate their own preferences independently, and modify the adaptation decision process to control application behaviours. Moreover, to demonstrate its applicability we have designed a set of evolvable situations and a context model, which complement the defeasible preferences for building smart home applications to enhance health care of the elderly.},

year={2015}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are usually designed for pervasive healthcare applications. Since the primary traffic in WBAN is vital physiological signals, guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) is crucial while designing WBAN. However, QoS of WBAN will be degraded in strong inter-WBAN interference environment such as hospitals and senior communities, where WBANs are densely deployed. In this paper, by focusing on a more practical WBAN model, we propose a non- cooperative power control game to mitigate inter- WBAN interference, in which the cost function is well designed by considering both QoS requirement and energy constraint. The existence of at least one Nash equilibrium (NE) point for the game is proved and a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the NE is derived. To guarantee non-cooperative among WBANs, an interference segmentation estimate (ISE) algorithm is proposed to obtain an approximation of the NE point. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISE algorithm.},

pages={56-61}, 
abstract={Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is a subjective concept, reflecting the overall mental and physical state of the patient, and their own sense of well-being. Estimating current and future QoL has become a major outcome in the evaluation of critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to enhance the inference process of 6 weeks and 6 months prognosis of QoL after intensive care unit (ICU) stay, using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The main outcomes of the study were the EQ-5D five main dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety depression. For each outcome, three Bayesian classifiers were built and validated with 10-fold cross-validation. Sixty and 473 patients (6 weeks and 6 months, respectively) were included. Overall, 6 months QoL is higher than 6 weeks, with the probability of absence of problems ranging from 31% (6 weeks mobility) to 72% (6 months self-care). Bayesian models achieved prognosis accuracies of 56% (6 months, anxiety depression) up to 80% (6 weeks, mobility). The prognosis inference process for an individual patient was enhanced with the visual analysis of the models, showing that women, elderly, or people with longer ICU stay have higher risk of QoL problems at 6 weeks. Likewise, for the 6 months prognosis, a higher APACHE II severity score also leads to a higher risk of problems, except for anxiety depression where the youngest and active have increased risk. Bayesian networks are competitive with less descriptive strategies, improve the inference process by incorporating domain knowledge and present a more interpretable model. The relationships among different factors extracted by the Bayesian models are in accordance with those collected by previous state-of-the-art literature, hence showing their usability as inference model.},

abstract={We present a method for improving human segmentation results in calibrated, multi-view environments using features derived from both pixel (image) and voxel (volume) space. The main focus of this work is to develop a low-cost, vision-based system for passive activity monitoring of older adults in the home, to capture early signs of illness and functional decline and allow seniors to live independently. Silhouettes are extracted to address privacy concerns. Specific embedded assessment goals include daily gait, fall risk, and overall activity, as well as fall detection. To achieve these goals, accurate, robust segmentation of human subjects (silhouette extraction) from captured video data is required. We present a simple technique that makes use of features acquired from background subtraction results (silhouettes) of multiple calibrated cameras, along with the 3D voxel object formed from the intersection of those multiple silhouettes in a volume space to improve human segmentation results in dynamic environments; moving objects, non-human objects, and lighting changes often complicate this task. The technique is qualitatively evaluated on three data sequences, two of which were captured in an independent living facility for older adults.},

abstract={The percentage of the elderly population grew rapidly in recent years, so the tremendous life and health care needs became an issue of focus in an aging society. The elderly nursing home plays an important role and intends to provide a comfortable environment and living space and serve as safe and healthy place for the elderly. However, the frailty and fragility of the elderly in both physiologically and psychologically make it an uneasy task. To enhance the service and care quality of an elderly nursing home, a ubiquitous monitor system integrated with biosensors and wireless network technology was implemented as a prototyping system. For managing sensors easily, the universal plug and play (UPnP) technology from digital living network alliance (DLNA) is adopted. The system was expected to be a digital health network to improve the activity of daily living (ADL) of the residents, to detect the emergencies or accidents such as stroke, falling down, fainting, and heart attack, in order to enhance the quality of care and promote efficiency at the same time.},

This approach has shown the extraordinary importance of emotions for the evaluation of situations in social contexts. Its results could serve as a neuroscientific grid for social solutions based on research on affects and emotions to actively prevent neural cells from stress. Our understanding and the technological monitoring of emotional states of the brain are now at a stage that an integrative solution can be realised to facilitate a healthy living of a new ageing generation. The aim is to develop a biofeedback system to prevent inactivity (often associated with blue mood and depression, atrophy and rapid decrease of the plasticity of the brain and the aging of neural cells). We developed and going to test a biofeedback system as a human-machine-human system preventing neural deterioration and stress. The envisaged applications will particularly strengthen the technological capacity and will be an important basis for further clinical or technological applications that preserve health and independence in old age.},

abstract={Power electronics are increasingly important in new generation vehicles as critical safety mechanical subsystems are being replaced with more electronic components. Hence, it is vital that the health of these power electronic components is monitored for safety and reliability on a platform. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic approach for predicting the remaining useful life of power electronic components. The developed algorithms must also be embeddable and computationally efficient to support on-board real-time decision making. Current state-of-the-art prognostic algorithms, notably those based on Markov models, are computationally intensive and not applicable to real-time embedded applications. In this paper, an isolated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is used as a case study for prognostic development. The proposed approach is developed by analyzing failure mechanisms and statistics of IGBT degradation data obtained from an accelerated aging experiment.

This allows the stochastic degradation model to be efficiently simulated, in this particular example ~1000 times more efficiently than Markov approaches.},

pages={414-417}, 
abstract={Over the last few decades, the number of senior citizens living alone in Japan has increased rapidly, to the point of dampening economic activity, increasing the load on the social security system, and decreasing the vitality of the local society. In particular, the lack of communication between a large number of elderly people and the local community has become a social problem, and such individuals are a burden on welfare workers and volunteers. With support from Kanagawa Prefectural Government, our joint research team has constructed a support system that would assist welfare workers and volunteers in serving elderly people living alone and building an active local community network. In this paper, we discuss an advanced community model based on the aforementioned information transmission welfare support system for the aging society. We also propose a system that estimates an individual's living conditions by measuring the vibrations caused by sounds such as opening/closing of doors, flushing of the toilet, etc. Experiments revealed that this system efficiently identifies unusual/abnormal activities in households where senior citizens live alone and sends alert signals. This network model provides the necessary support to rescue workers and helps in establishing interactions between elderly citizens and their neighbors; further, it can be used to organize patrol activities.},

pages={243-244}, 
abstract={Our community is facing serious Aging Society especially in Japan. We have investigated in one of daycare centers which are facilities for elderly care. As the result, we realized that communication is needed for its own sake in these facilities and active communication can cure even depression and dementia. Therefore we propose to cope with these problems using a robot as a communication activator in order to improve group communication. We define group communication as one of types of communication which is formed by several persons. This time, we focus on a recreation game named “Nandoku. ” Nandoku is a quiz which can be described as group communication with a master of ceremony (MC). The system always selects its behavior and target (a participant in the game) to maximize “communication activeness”. Communication activeness is defined as amount of several panelists'(ordinary three: A, B, C) participation, which are calculated with panelists' face direction using camera information. For instance, if participant A is not fully participating by not making eye contact, the system is expected to select one of the behaviors such as “Can you answer, Mr.A?” to encourage A to participate in the game. We experimented with the system in a daycare center. As the result, obvious increase in participation was observed. That offers evidence that the robot can serve a practical role in improving the group communication as a communication activator especially for entertainment use.},

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are utilized to allow various populations including citizens with chronic conditions, disabilities, older adults and families to live independently in their preferred environment. Thus, systems are patient-centered rather than institution-centered as they are designed to address the needs of the elderly, their families and caregivers rather than these of health care facilities. Technology advances rapidly and it is an imperative to ensure that smart environments are designed, implemented and evaluated properly addressing not only technical challenges but also the end users' needs, ethical, clinical and policy issues and the design of sustainable and non-obtrusive interventions.},

abstract={The progressive ageing of population has turned the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into a prevalent disease suffered by elderly. Consequently, the spatial disorientation has become a significant problem for older people and their caregivers. The ambient-assisted living applications are offering location-based services for empowering elderly to go outside and encouraging a greater independence. Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness service enabler aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the service enabler introduced contribute to “context-awareness” paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences.},

abstract={A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.},

As a new urban development, a smart community concept has been proposed in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) before the earthquake. That concept aims an integrated and optimized community society with a variety of social services such as an energy, transportation, and logistics system. Currently, many problems for living in temporary houses have occurred. Particularly, the disuse syndrome in the elderly in temporary housing is serious. The many elderly have lost connection with outside community, because of moving to the temporary housing. And then they become withdrawal condition. Finally, they become bedridden by decline in physical function. These problems are common problem in future aging society in Japan. In this paper, the support model for a living on temporary houses in the disaster area is mentioned. The model become to a test bed model based on smart community toward future aging society.},

While stand-alone computer security and database security courses are offered in college-level computer science degree programs, these courses do not reach all computing majors and are often available only for senior level students. We believe that security should be incorporated into the computing curriculum at every level, including high school computing courses. In this paper we show how to extend the widely popular high school-level Oracle Academy program with security concepts. The proposed curriculum extensions require minimal changes to the current curriculum while introducing students to the security threats in database systems. We provide example database laboratory materials that can be included in a high school database or computer science course. We show that security concepts can be presented to the students even at this early stage of their education. We propose age and education-level appropriate methods, such as computer gaming and social interaction, to deliver the security relevant course modules. We also argue that it is imperative to educate high school teachers on database security topics to ensure satisfactory delivery of the security components.},

abstract={Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system that affects elderly. There are six main symptoms: tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movements), hand asymmetry, posture instability and freezing of gait. Nowadays any type of diagnose for this disorder is done through observation by a health care professional specialized in this area. Therefore a simpler and more efficient method that General Practioners can use to have some grounded information to decide to forward a possible patient to a specialist is needed. With this in mind different systems were studied coming to the conclusion that a mobile application is among the best options. This work can be split in four important phases (see Figure 1): (1) study of the current market for this problem and for the solution to be developed, (2) development of a smartphone application capable of gathering data of the early symptoms of Parkinson's taking into consideration all the smartphone's specifications; (3) use the application to gather data from real patients and a control group and (4) test and select a classification algorithm. The first phase involved two research topics: problem and solution. The problem consisted in studying all the symptoms that could theoretically be detected by the different smartphone components. The solution consisted in studying the different methods used to solve such a problem using data mining techniques (different feature selection and classification algorithms that best take advantage of the nature of the data gathered). The second phase consisted in the development of the smartphone application with four components (spiral analysis, tap analysis, simple questions and gait analysis). The third phase was dedicated in building the control group gathering data from healthy people and a Parkinson patients group for a total of 35 subjects. Finally, the fourth phase was using the studied algorithms to filter the different features- and compare the different algorithms selected. With the available data from the test subjects it was possible to achieve promising results from the gait analysis of the patients where the pelvic sway was a good feature to help differentiate Parkinson patients from healthy ones.},

abstract={The Pervasive Computing Laboratory at the University of Florida is dedicated to creating smart environments and assistants to enable elderly persons to live a longer and a more independent life at home. By achieving this goal, technology will increase the chances of successful aging despite an ailing health care system (e.g. Medicaid). One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house.},

abstract={The elderly population has increased in recent years, leading to increased prevalence and incidence of chronic-degenerative diseases, leading to cognitive impairment. A new trend of intervention used by health professionals have been using technological resources in their clinical practices. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of two programs of cognitive stimulation. A program is composed of traditional techniques and the other by inserting a computer system with games called Promoting Cognitive Performance - ProDC. An experimental study with the elderly aged 60 or older, of both sexes, classified with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia through the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). There were no statistically significant differences between groups. However, the results revealed important aspects to be discussed in the use of technological resources, such as games.},

abstract={The computer-based portable devices lead our societies to the world of u-healthcare, so that people may monitor their heart rate outside hospitals. The paper proposes an ultra-wearable smart sensor system combines electrocardiogram (ear-lead ECG), tri-axial accelerometer, and GPS sensors to measure normal or elderly personpsilas daily activities. The ear-lead makes possible to measure ECG signals without any chest belt or sticky tape. It measures the ECG signals from an ear to an arm. According to our research, the ear-lead is linear combination with regular ECG lead I and III. For most of people, especially, the ear-lead is highly correlated with lead-I ECG. Lead I can be used to detect some life-threatening ECG signals with critical heart rate or morphology changes such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular flutter (VFL), or ventricular fibrillation (VFib). The hardware of smart sensor integrates a TI MSP430 microprocessor, Bluetooth wireless transmission to PC client software, micro SD card storage, and LCD display. The embedded algorithm combines two sensors for noise reduction and utilizes voice biofeedback for exercise overload warning.},

Gait of elderly is captured with motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to recognize the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg. Experimental results showed that decision tree classifier was able to reach only 95% of classification accuracy, using 7 tags and 5 mm standard deviation of noise. On the other hand, k-nearest neighbor was much more accurate since it reached classification accuracy of over 99%, using only 8 tags with 0-20 mm noise.},

In short it identifies usability problems with future interaction technologies and map these future interaction technologies to e-Services.

year={2015}, 
pages={170-176}, 
abstract={At DOMUS for the past 14 years, several cognitive orthotics were designed and implemented and evaluated, most of the time using participatory design. The resulting set of orthotics can support a wide variety of activities of daily living (ADL) to foster autonomy at home for people with cognitive impairments, e.g. medication, meal preparation, or budget. DOMUS benefits from a rich and versatile research infrastructure to design, implement, and evaluate such orthotics, namely a smart apartment on the campus, a living lab in an alternative housing unit for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), seniors' residences, personal residences (apartments and houses). To different extents, all these places can be considered as living labs. In this paper, building on our extensive experience, we first show that participative design is the best-suited methodology for developing cognitive orthotics in living labs. Clinical researchers, caregivers, and end users are involved from the start. This ensures that design is user driven and that assistive technologies will satisfy users needs. Then we propose a classification of living labs according to the levels of control one can have on which and how much technology is deployed, on how space is organized and how it may vary from experiment to experiment, and on how the progression and execution of a scenario can be constrained or not. For each category of living labs, we discuss their different yet complementary characteristics, highlighting their pros and cons. For instance, our smart apartment provides tight control over technology, space, and execution of predefined scenarios. Accordingly evaluations then provide a lot of useful and reliable information about technology and the ability for people to use it, but less on acceptance of the technology and its integration at one's real home in her daily life habits.},

abstract={The aging of population is the grim reality which world is facing in the twenty-first century. At the same time, rates of disability are increasing due to population ageing and increases in chronic health conditions. These bring great challenge to elderly and disabled care in the whole society, since their physiological and pathological characteristics always bring them many inconveniences. In order to better serve the disabled and elderly people and provide them timely care in some public places, it is important to be aware of the location of them. At present, this has been a key focus that includes determining their physical location accurately and turning coordinates into meaningful information. This paper provides a sensor fusion-based infrastructure independent and agile real-time indoor positioning technology which can be used in monitoring the exact three-dimensional indoor location of the elderly and disabled people. It takes advantage of the built-in sensors in the wearable devices to analyze human movement and combine the map information to improve the location accuracy. The most prominent feature of method is that it requires no training or extra infrastructure. The experimental results show that the algorithm obtains high localization precision and preferable robustness.},

abstract={Care settings for older people, such as nursing homes, can have low levels of social interaction, which has been shown in many studies as being crucial to both the mental and physical well-being of older adults. Furthermore, increased social interaction has been shown to have a positive effect on adjustment in institutions for the aged. However, these social connections can be lost due to movement within the care system, with residents regularly relocating for a variety of reasons including cost and medical issues. Eleven health professionals and six residents living in a care home in Ireland were interviewed about their social activities and levels of engagement within the home. Storyboards were then developed and presented to the residents based on these interviews. Findings from the interviews indicate that activity levels among the more cognitively able residents are quite low due to activities catering for the less able residents. Furthermore, a lack of access to information and resources (such as books and newspapers) means that these more able residents reported experiencing long periods of boredom. Technology can potentially allow residents access to such information and resources, enabling them to pursue activities in their personal time which can then also be used as the basis for group discussions. The use of technology could, in addition, allow those residents who had moved out of the home to continue to participate and collaborate in activities with the other residents.},

This is due to an increase in the average age of the population, together with a greater focus on providing non-hospital health care services, and greater availability of low-cost components to support such systems. It is expected that smart home care technologies would be potentially useful in monitoring the safety of the elderly in the home environment. The safety of older and disabled people can be continuously monitored without interrupting their daily routine with intelligent devices and modern sensors located in their home environment and on the body. While home care technologies are beneficial for older people, and encourage independence, there are still privacy and safety issue that need to be considered if such systems are to be widely adopted. Further research is required, especially with respect to regarding use cases and the cost implications of home-based systems.},

abstract={An ageing population is now the leading healthcare concern of many countries in the world. Aged patients need more healthcare efforts as they present more cases of chronic illnesses involving higher healthcare costs. e-Health systems based on modern information technology are expected to play a role in alleviating this problem. Fortunately, there have been dramatic advances in healthcare technology in terms of mobility, size, speed and communication. However, the main drawbacks of currently deployed e-Health monitoring systems originate from the fact that patients are 'constrained' within smart rooms and beds fitted with monitoring devices. Such monitoring is not ubiquitous in view of the privacy, mobility and flexibility issues concerning patients. On the other hand, health monitoring products strapped to the patient's body provide no analysis or recommendations of results. A multi-agent architecture for mobile health monitoring is presented, involving a team of intelligent agents that collate patient data, reason collectively and recommend actions to patients and medical staff in a mobile environment.},

abstract={Evidences across industries including telecommunication, retail and trading, suggests many benefits are to be gained from automation. To obtain these benefits in the field of healthcare, there have been vast amount of studies conducted on utilization of technological capabilities during the past few decades. From medical information systems to Telemedicine to ubiquitous computing, smart and connected health applications are designed to have a positive impact on current and future health care practices. While there have been a lot of successful innovations in these applications, there have also been a lot of failure. Study of these applications highlights the importance of user involvements from the very early stage of new product development. This paper utilizes the categories identified in Smart and Connected Health (SCH) terminology recognized by National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct a holistic study of different technological applications developed for healthcare to identify major barriers inhibiting their diffusion. The User Centered Design (UCD) methodologies proven valuable in industrial contexts are reviewed to highlight their characteristics and capabilities to facilitate user involvement. It references cases where they have been valuable toolkits to address barriers recognized. Finally, the study categorizes the major barriers captured throughout the study and recommends best user centered design(s) approaches to be deployed for superior front-end management of healthcare solution innovation.},

abstract={As people age, older adults' health begins to slow down. Moreover, the elderly population number will grow in upcoming years, according to statistics. This fact can lead to clinics and the hospitals becoming overloaded, and the demand for supervision becomes a challenge for the healthcare area. Because the majority of health issues are in the kinesiology domain, using new technologies like Kinect Sensor, this paper proposes a home system that implies the serious games for older adults, machine learning models for exercises recognition and remote activity supervision. The aim is to minimize the physical effort by offering a believable and motivating virtual world where the patient simulates kinesiology exercises, responds to quizzes and sends feedback. In the same time, the system recovers the exercise data and interprets it in order to model personalized care solutions, to create user profiles, to calibrate the difficulty level of the game using a language of powerful questions, to analyze the exercises progress and the performance feedback, to detect symptoms or falls and to learn the users' behavior. The approach described in this paper is based on analyses of the existing similar systems and on the statistics regarding the acceptability of the lifestyle in self-management physical level for elders.},

abstract={The convergence of Internet and mobile devices has radically changed the way people communicate and interact with each other, and demand for applications that are "social" enough to assist their daily interactions. To support such device mediated interactions, the social relationships between actors need to be systematically modeled and represented. In addition, an application facilitating such interactions should be able to deal with the task conflicts that occur when an actor is involved in multiple interactions simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper we present an approach to modeling and coordinating social interactions with the notion of social context. It supports social interaction modeling from both the domain- and player-centric perspectives. In particular, the player-centric model provides the basis to coordinate multiple interactions in which an actor is involved. We further introduce a fuzzy logic based reasoning technique to infer the overall importance of each interaction, assisting the actor to resolve conflicts and make decisions. Finally, we validate our approach through a prototype implementation and test cases analysis.},

abstract={An alarm system suitable for pervasive healthcare in rural areas is presented. Taking advantage of ZigBee features, users can move freely around their habitual environment while enjoying constant protection. The resulting system is cost-effective, easily deployed (no wiring is needed) and the mobile device's batteries last for months. The user interface is a key issue when working with the elderly and those with disabilities. To ensure proper usability and avoid abandoning of the device, an alarm-detection procedure has been developed and contrasted with end-users. The application scenario is the isolated village of Fortanete, Spain, where the self- sustainability of the system is essential. In this environment, management of the alarm relies upon the user's relatives and neighbours to solve any problems that arise. Privacy and ethical considerations have also been addressed, as this kind of system can potentially invade the users' privacy; cognitive disabilities of the users also make it mandatory.},

pages={179-189}, 
abstract={Elderly in-home assistance (EHA) has traditionally been tackled by human caregivers to equip the elderly with homecare assistance in their daily living. The emerging ambience intelligence (AmI) technology suggests itself to be of great potential for EHA applications, owing to its effectiveness in building a context-aware environment that is sensitive and responsive to the presence of humans. This paper presents a case-driven AmI (C-AmI) system, aiming to sense, predict, reason, and act in response to the elderly activities of daily living (ADLs) at home. The C-AmI system architecture is developed by synthesizing various sensors, activity recognition, case-based reasoning, along with EHA-customized knowledge, within a coherent framework. An EHA information model is formulated through the activity recognition, case comprehension, and assistive action layers. The rough set theory is applied to model ADLs based on the sensor platform embedded in a smart home. Assistive actions are fulfilled with reference to a priori case solutions and implemented within the AmI system through human-object-environment interactions. Initial findings indicate the potential of C-AmI for enhancing context awareness of EHA applications.},

Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis.

abstract={In Ambient Assisted Living scenarios, elderly people are supported by pervasive and smart environments in their daily mobility and activities, with which they interact by means of a variety of devices and services deployed in the house. These devices, in addition to their particular function, can provide useful context information about the user behavior. In this paper we propose an indoor localization technique that exploits the presence of commercially available devices in the GiraffPlus AAL environment. GiraffPlus is a EU funded project, running in several test sites across Europe, that combines social interaction and long-term monitoring to help people live independently. In this context, the proposed localization algorithm is able to provide the position information in terms of last room visited by the user improving considerably the reaction of a user's caregiver in emergency situations. This paper also aims at providing a performance characterization of the commercially available devices used in the GiraffPlus AAL environments. We prove that, in order to guarantee an high level of reliability, this kind of device show a considerable transmission delay that makes the localization process non-trivial.},

abstract={In recent years, the increase in aging population in developed countries has become one of the most important societal challenges. It is becoming more and more important to ensure quality care and services in countries with a rapidly increasing ageing population and find solutions to lower the costs of healthcare. Digital technologies could present a solution in the form of digital health but the question of ubiquitous availability of these technologies is then brought to the forefront. Mobile broadband has become the fastest growing market segment which makes mHealth applications a good alternative for offering healthcare and well-being services to a wide range of users. However, without a ubiquitous and reliable mobile broadband connection, the availability of most high-bandwidth and life-critical applications is still questionable. In addition, privacy and confidentiality have always been important cornerstones in healthcare and must also be ensured in mHealth applications. Of particular interest are self-monitoring mobile applications, which have shown promise in increasing awareness of the variability of patient symptoms as well as offering reassurance through monitoring. Therefore, low-bandwidth, non-critical mHealth applications, which take advantage of existing networks and give users the opportunity to monitor their health parameters with the added input from their physician, should be more widely implemented. In this article the above-mentioned challenges are discussed and an example of an implementation of an mHealth application for diabetes self-management is presented.},

abstract={This paper describes the development of a computer-based serious game to enable older individuals to practice Tai Chi at home on their own. The player plays the game by imitating Tai Chi movements presented by a virtual instructor on the screen. The proposed system is decomposed into two modules. The first module is the game design, i.e., the process of recording an instructor training Tai Chi. Acquired data are used to create gesture templates and a virtual instructor. The second module is the game play in which the player attempts to mimic the virtual instructor. Gestures are measured in real-time and then compared with the prerecorded Tai Chi gesture template corresponding to the displayed movement. Visual feedback indicates how well the player imitated the instructor. The proposed system is not designed to classify gestures but to evaluate the similarity of a given gesture with a gesture template. The Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) method is applied to compute such similarity. The proposed approach (1) facilitates the design of assessment tools in which the user has to follow a sequence of predefined movements and (2) applicable to other domains, such as telerehabilitation.},

abstract={Mild sclerotic thickening of the aortic valve affects 25% of the population, and the condition causes aortic valve stenosis (AS) in 2% of adults above 65 years. Echocardiography is today the clinical standard for assessing AS. However, a cost effective and uncomplicated technique that can be used for decision support in the primary health care would be of great value. In this study, recorded phonocardiographic signals were analyzed using the first local minimum of the auto mutual information (AMI) function. The AMI method measures the complexity in the sound signal, which is related to the amount of turbulence in the blood flow and thus to the severity of the stenosis. Two previously developed phonocardiographic methods for assessing AS severity were used for comparison, the murmur energy ratio and the sound spectral averaging technique. Twenty-nine patients with suspected AS were examined with Doppler echocardiography. The aortic jet velocity was used as a reference of AS severity, and it was found to correlate with the AMI method, the murmur energy ratio and the sound spectral averaging technique with the correlation coefficient R = 0.82, R = 0.73 and R = 0.76, respectively.},

The high-level development of the system that extracts and stores information plays an essential role to deal with the avalanche of context data. In our case, the multi-agent system approach results satisfactorily because each agent that represents an autonomous entity with different capabilities and offers different services works collaboratively with each other. Several tests have been performed on this platform to evaluate/demonstrate its validity.},

A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living.

abstract={Physical inactivity is a leading risk factor in a number of chronic diseases. Older adults are at the highest risk because they are the least inactive of all age groups. Smartphone-based intervention techniques present the opportunity to support cost-effective behavioral intervention to promote physical activity. We present a pilot study that examines the feasibility of utilizing the “Strive” smartphone-based passive sensing application to motivate older adults to stay active. Eight participants aged between 50 and 80 years used the application over a period of three weeks to track their daily activity habits. Participants carried smartphones to track daily activities and introspected about their lifestyles as part of weekly check-in sessions. The value that 24×7 smartphone-based sensors provided to this population was an easy-to-use and always available companion to promote awareness about their physical activity. The main motivations for participants to stay active were to prevent loss of personal health due ageing and the need to stay young. Participants increased their daily physical activity by 15% over the first week. This increase was mainly driven by the younger participants. Participants were willing to bear the inconvenience of physical activity tracking due a phone if it meant that they would obtain a better report of their daily physical activities. Any application that tracks physical activity using smartphones needs to address the wearability of the phone.},

When pervasive computing is used to provide technology-driven assistive healthcare, there is a need for the system to be as intelligent and sophisticated as possible, while also being as transparent and accountable as possible for both subject and caregivers. The CARA (Context Aware Real-time Assistant) healthcare system implements a sophisticated hybrid reasoning framework that incorporates both rule-based and case-based reasoning mechanisms. This provides a novel solution that combines context awareness, general domain knowledge, and automated intelligence for pervasive healthcare. The use of a sophisticated reasoning engine in healthcare demands accountability of the system. To improve the accountability of the reasoning system, we explored the use of case provenance to provide better understanding of the reasoning outcome to the user, and increase transparency. We developed a semantic-based mechanism to check the correctness and coherence of the fuzzy rules by detecting possible conflicts, this aims to eliminate inconsistency.},

abstract={The number of elderly or patients having chronic disease living alone are increasing in recent years. Without children's help, they may not able to call for help by themselves when encountering health threatening conditions, like falling down or the suddenly heart attack, which may lose the best time for medical attention. This paper presents an automatic danger detecting and alerting tool for elderly or patients living alone, called We Care. It contains an easily wearable Badge and a Service Center. A cheap and energy efficient accelerometer is added to the Badge detecting 1) the falling down event, 2) the unexpected movement and motionlessness events and 3) the going out and going back home events. A GSM module is integrated to communicate with the Service Center and alerts their family members or doctors when the above events happened. By accessing the Service Center's website, the user can configure his Badge remotely. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our tool, which show that our tool is not only cheap and well-designed, but also customizable and with high usability.},

title={Designing for ubiquity: the perception of privacy}, 
year={2003}, 
volume={2}, 
number={2}, 
pages={40-46}, 
abstract={Ubicomp researchers have long argued that privacy is a design issue, and it goes without saying that successful design requires that we understand the desires, concerns, and awareness of the technology's users. Yet, because ubicomp systems are relatively unusual, too little empirical research exists to inform designers about potential users. Complicating design further is the fact that ubicomp systems are typically embedded or invisible, making it difficult for users to know when invisible devices are present and functioning. As early as 1993, ubicomp researchers recognized that embedded technology's unobtrusiveness both belies and contributes to its potential for supporting potentially invasive applications. Not surprisingly, users' inability to see a technology makes it difficult for them to understand how it might affect their privacy. Unobtrusiveness, nevertheless, is a reasonable goal because such systems must minimize the demands on users. To investigate these issues further, I conducted an ethnographic study of what I believe is the first US eldercare facility to use a sensor-rich environment. Our subjects were normal civilians (rather than ubicomp researchers) who lived or worked in a ubiquitous computing environment. We interviewed residents, their family members, and the facility's caregivers and managers. Our questions focused on how people understood both the ubiquitous technology and its effect on their privacy. Although the embedded technology played a central role in how people viewed the environment, they had a limited understanding of the technology, thus raising several privacy, design, and safety issues.},

abstract={The increasing elderly population is changing the demography of many countries, becoming a major issue for society. As a direct consequence of this demographic phenomenon, allied to technological developments and pressure to reduce healthcare costs, new healthcare technologies for proactive health and elder care is needed. However, interoperability issues among different levels of available technologies restricts a wider deployment among intermediate and end-users. This work presents a service-oriented middleware that was developed to provide access to the functionality offered by virtually any existing device, or application, in a residential setting, in a transparent and intuitive form. The proposed middleware abstracts the communication technologies involved, allowing to seemingly integrate different communication protocols, making possible the distributed cooperation of devices that were built as stand-alone products. As a test case, an application was built with the middleware to monitor blood pressure and electromyography signal using typical health devices.},

The results of a deployment of an AAIS during 2 months in the home of a PwD, indicate that the AAIS successfully addressed some of the problematic behaviors exhibited by the PwD, helping to reduce the burden of the caregiver.},

abstract={Pervasive healthcare environments provide an effective solution for monitoring the wellbeing of the elderly where the general trend of an increasingly ageing population has placed significant burdens on current healthcare systems. An important pervasive healthcare system functionality is patient motion analysis where gait information can be used to detect walking behavior abnormalities that may indicate the onset of adverse health problems, for quantifying post-operative recovery, and to observe the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of accurate motion analysis models, however, requires the integration of multi-sensing modalities and the utilization of appropriate data analysis techniques. This paper describes a simple and robust framework for improved patient motion analysis based on an ambient and a wearable sensor. Using visual information from a single vision sensor, target segmentation is first carried out and a skeleton extraction procedure is subsequently applied to quantify the target internal motion by computing two metrics, spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory. Extracted accelerometer information from a wearable body sensor is fused with the extracted metrics at the feature level by using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify target's walking gait into normal or abnormal. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

title={Elderly Mobility and Daily Routine Analysis Based on Behavior-Aware Flow Graph Modeling}, 
year={2015}, 
pages={427-436}, 
abstract={With the advent of ubiquitous computing and sensor technologies, indoor trajectory data of individuals can readily be collected to support analysis of their underlying movement behaviors. Different methods for activity recognition have been proposed where supervised learning algorithms are often adopted. In many applications like elderly care, the behaviors to be characterized are often not known in a priori and the behaviors of different individuals cannot be assumed similar even for the same activity type. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning methodology to first extract from the trajectory data of an individual behavioral patterns as representations of his/her daily activities, and then infer the patterns' occurrence per day for daily routine analysis. Extracting behavioral patterns is challenging as the patterns often carry long-range dependency and appear with spatio-temporal variations, making the conventional frequent pattern mining approach not suitable. We propose to model the trajectory data using a behavior-aware flow graph which is a probabilistic finite state automaton where the nodes and edges are attributed with local behavioral features. We then apply the weighted kernel k-means algorithm to the flow graph to identify sub flows as the behavioral patterns, followed by non-negative matrix factorization to compute the daily routine patterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it to a publicly available data set that contains trajectories of an elder living in a smart home for 219 days. With reference to the ground truth, our experimental results show that the proposed flow graph allows more accurate activity-specific behavioral patterns to be extracted as compared to a frequent pattern clustering approach. Also, we illustrate how the proposed method can be used to support daily routine analysis.},

Preventive medication management is enabled by an intelligent package sealed by Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by RFID link. Various vital parameters are collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the short range wireless link. Onsite diagnosis and prognosis based on these health parameters are supported by the scalable architecture.

abstract={Recent studies and workshops have stressed the fundamental importance of providing harmonised health and social care services that meet the extended needs of the individual, taking into account diversity in need, preferences, ability and support. For a real caring society, the notion of "information sharing" becomes clearly crucial when communication and interaction in health care is needed. This paper revisits recent funded projects undertaken by our team, in view of the so-called coordination of planned activities for elderly/disabled care and independent living support. Three development pillars are taken under consideration herein, namely, affective exergaming services for seniors/disabled, social media and the semantic web. Outputs from a multitude of projects are then used to provide evidence of how issues recently encountered under the so-called blue line dimensions are tackled; these are technological interoperability, semantic integration, modern interfaces, people needs/expectations and societal incentives. As the latter synthesize a con-temporary puzzle of personalised health care approach, this paper provides an innovative perspective of interlinking developments and outputs of research in view of improving healthcare.},

CSCC supports improved communication among individuals and a balanced distribution of responsibilities to allow the elder to live at home despite increasing care needs. The problem of coordinating the care of elders living at home hasn't been well defined or explored. We focus on using technology to aid the elder's entire support network. To distinguish this space from the broader research issues of computer-supported cooperative work, we call it computer-supported coordinated care and propose that it is a meaningful focus for the pervasive computing, CSCW, and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities.},

abstract={The emerging of wireless sensor network has profound impacts on many fields, among which medical application is important one. Wireless biomedical sensor network can provide long-term, real-time and non-obstructive medical supervision for the patients. The large scale application of wireless medical sensor network can effectively reduce higher cost burden owing to the aging society and long term healthcare for the chronic ill. It can also enhance the quality of life for elderly people and chronic patients, and decrease the probability of medical errors. This paper presents a pervasive medical supervision system based on the wireless sensor network on the acceptable cost and application feasibility. Except for bio-information such as the oximetry, the heart rate/pulse and the blood pressure, our system also provides some associated context data, e.g., the environment temperature, and the patient's video/picture in emergency situation which distinguishes our research with other similar systems. The design and implementation of the system composition are discussed in this paper. We also preliminary explore the network schedule mechanism of compound data transmission in this system.},

The contribution of this paper identifies the importance of developing and designing tailored virtual places which older members of society can utilize easily and safely within this context, with a focused application of addressing social isolation, enabling well being and lifelong learning. In this paper we also discuss our experiences of introducing SL to an elderly community and imparting to them the skills required to interact within the 3D environment and the resources that we developed to support their induction and training. This paper explores the impact of this approach and signposts next steps in experimenting with the use of SL as a domesticated digital technology tool that offers potential to support Ageing Well in our Information Society.

abstract={Developed societies are currently facing severe demographic changes: the world population is ageing at an unprecedented rate. This demographic trend will be also followed by an increase of people with physical limitations. New challenges are being raised to the traditional health care systems, not only in Portugal, but also in all other European states. There is an urgent need to find solutions that allow extending the time people can live in their preferred environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility. AAL4ALL is a project currently being developed in cooperation with 34 Portuguese interdisciplinary partners, from industry to academia, R&D and social disciplines, which employs a novel conceptual approach through the development of an ecosystem of products and services for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) associated to a business model and validated through large scale trial. This paper presents a comparative perspective of the needs and attitudes towards technology of the AAL users and caregivers identified in the analysis of a set of three different surveys: a users survey targeted at the Portuguese seniors and pre-seniors; an informal caregivers survey targeted at the family, friends and neighbours who provide care without any financial compensation; and a formal caregivers survey targeted at physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and direct-care workers providing care to elders. The first results indicate that AAL solutions must be affordable, user friendly and have a true perceived benefit to their users.},

abstract={Mobile smartphones have revolutionized the concept of mobile phones as different apps are built to offer various interesting applications in healthcare, gaming, etc. rather than using the phone only for voice services. The application developers take advantage of onboard sensors, web connectivity and powerful processing units of the smartphones to develop such interesting apps. In this paper, we present an interesting approach where direct acoustic coupling technique is employed to quickly and conveniently convert the smartphones into high quality digital stethoscope by using an ultra-low cost attachment. The design consideration primarily focused on affordability, simplicity and use-friendly aspects into account. The motivation of this work is to enable the heart patients to send their heart sound to doctor's chamber/ hospitals from their home instead of travelling all the way to hospitals/clinics. This is particularly useful in poor or developing countries where there is scarcity of healthcare centers and patients have to travel a long distance to visit the clinic. The situation becomes more serious in case of patients who went through heart surgery and requires follow up visits or for elderly population requiring routine checkups. For both the cases, in many instances, doctors primarily listen to the heart sound to prescribe further actions. Our solution can greatly help such situations and in many cases it can completely eliminate the travel. In addition, since data can also be recorded and saved, this opens up possibility for statistical analysis to further aid the diagnosis / monitoring. Thus, our solution can serve as a viable tool in connected health use cases for heart patients for needy geography.},

Considering multiple vital factors in a real-life scenario an intelligent decision support system could be developed and work more efficiently if associated with Pervasive Data Mining techniques. The approach presented in this research work illustrates the Pervasive Data Mining for Intensive care unit which utilizes “Adaptive Direct Acyclic Graph based Support Vector Machine” (ADAGSVM) to classify the health conditions of elderly patients. An Adult Prognostic Index (API) scoring system has been utilized which could be calculated on the basis of six important vital signs.

Interviews and a focus group were used to establish their understandings of online community and social networking sites (SNS) within the context of existing relationships in local communities. Past experiences of local community influenced expectations for online community and its authenticity. At the same time four catalysts were identified which motivated engagement with community resources both online and locally. These were: 'spaces and places', family, roles and loss. A sense of 'real' community was maintained through meeting people face to face with online communities and SNS being used predominantly as tools for achieving this aim. Exploration of the catalysts offers ways that greater community involvement might be further facilitated through design initiatives that make online community feel more 'real' to older users.},

abstract={Here, we present pervasive computing technology to determine the wellness of the elderly living independently in their homes. The framework of the intelligent system consists of monitoring important daily activities through the observation of everyday object usage. The improved wellness indices defined here have helped in reducing false warnings related to the daily activities of elderly living. Time series data processing techniques have been applied to the improved wellness indicators, to take care of the dynamic situation in relation to aging of the elderly and seasonal weather variation. With a minimal number of binary motion sensors, the elderly were tracked in real time to get better information on their physical condition. The developed system was able to recognize 94 percent of the basic daily activities accurately, and at the same time the system was able to assess the wellness activities quantitatively in near real time. The well-being indices of the elderly can be used by the healthcare providers to take preventive measures on deterioration of activities of daily living, and thus consequently reduce cost of healthcare.},

abstract={The FP6 project “Wireless Accessible Sensor Populations” (WASP) has developed an end-to-end infrastructure for the deployment and enterprise integration of wireless sensor nodes. The infrastructure is generic and allows for optimisation for a variety of applications by the development of dedicated services that can be distributed over (wearable and ambient) sensor nodes, the WSN gateway, and the enterprise (backend) system. Key to many applications, such as elderly care considered in this paper, is to optimise the battery lifetime of wearable sensor nodes that can be (remotely) customized to the monitoring needs of individual persons and to the quality-of-service demands for offered services. The WASP infrastructure provides practical solutions for these targets and is being validated for realistic elderly care scenarios. These scenario's aim to support the elderly in (semi-) independent Ambient Assisted Living settings as well as to provide health workers with effective means of studying transient deterioration and behavior changes characteristic to the ageing population.},

abstract={Health professionals, nursing and care staff are in short supply to cater to all the needs of the growing, global elderly population. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low cost and low power context aware robotic system to assist the elderly due to a desire to develop accessible technology for all countries and considering the poverty of many elderly. The system is furnished with 4 wheels for indoor navigation. It is equipped with 'environmental parameter monitoring' sensors and the system can be controlled by the user through voice commands. The system interprets the environmental contexts and makes context aware decisions based on the sensed information. On the basis of the previous medical history from the database server and the newly interpreted data, the decision making unit makes efficient decisions and gives feedback to the device control unit. The system improves the health of the elderly by regularly monitoring the environmental conditions of people.},

pages={2098-2103}, 
abstract={In this paper we compare and evaluate different time segments of patient handling transfer techniques at a residential nursing home for the elderly. Nursing personnel were accompanied over three weeks and transfer techniques between bed and chair were recorded with a stopwatch. The total transfer time of a patient transfer is divided into three segments: preparation, transfer and dismantling time. The nursing staff at the residential nursing home makes use of three transfer techniques: the ubiquitous manual transfer, transfers with slide sheets and transfers using floor lifts. These transfer techniques have been analyzed and compared showing that floor lifts require significantly more time in all three segments (311 s) than slide sheets (115 s) and manual transfers (74 s), while slide sheets only slightly increase the time taken to accomplish a comfortable repositioning of the patient. The manual transfer is still by far the most popular method, despite numerous studies that have evaluated such methods hazardous. New devices are necessary that must accommodate a safe transfer and be as fast as a manual transfer in order to be accepted among nursing staff as the demand for professional nursing staff continues to rise.},

abstract={Active diagnosis aims at significantly improving system reliability by computing diagnostic information at run-time for fault isolation and online error recovery. The presented work extends semantic techniques, usually used in large-scale IT systems, for active diagnosis in open embedded real time systems. Open embedded systems (e.g., ambient assisted living for elderly care, critical infrastructures, health management and medical systems) exhibit real-time and reliability requirements, while the constituent components are unknown at design time. Time-triggered diagnostic inference supports the incremental generation of symptoms, which result from the temporal and spatial decomposition of the diagnostic analysis process. The methods and algorithms are prototypically implemented, as well as experimentally evaluated. The paper demonstrates that dynamic semantic web services in combination with time-triggered scheduling techniques are suitable to enable active diagnosis in open embedded systems with reliability and real-time requirements.},

year={2009}, 
pages={vi-vii}, 
abstract={Our aging society in industrialised countries is not only characterised by higher age and better health in general, but in age related capabilities and handicaps often based on chronic diseases and functional losses. Additionally multimorbidity can lead to functional losses followed by handicaps and disabilities. In consequence the elderly person can suffer from immobility, social isolation and depression. Furthermore it implies a high risk of loosing his or her independence. The main aim for those elderly is to obtain their `every day competence' in spite of lifelong handicap and chronic disease. Cause of new developments in ambient technologies there is a challenge to supplement multi- and interdisciplinary approach to fulfil these aims. Ambient technologies as part of information and communication technologies have a great potential to influence quality of life for elderly people and prolong their independence. We will report about different examples of ambient technologies for this challenge. In `Tele-Reha', a tele-rehabilitation-project, mobility-impaired patients after discharge from hospital, their caregiving relatives, and geriatric professionals were comprised using PC-based videoconferencing systems. Additional they got access to a computer based information service. The objective was to prevent social isolation, more functional disabilities and secondary diseases which may result in the frequent need for outpatient or inpatient treatment. Another project focused on patients after stroke or hip fracture by sensor technology based home rehabilitation. Most of our patients have not reached their full potential of mobility and independence after the hospital. We conduct studies to investigate the feasibility of a sensor based home exercise program for motor learning. The project `nutribook' was developed for patients with severe chronic nutrition deficits who live at home and have ambulant services by nurses and their family doctors.},

abstract={In this document we present an intelligence device which includes a monitor system for automatic movements of a robotic hospital bed based on posture classification and identification. This functionality has been developed in response to the requirements defined by the application of a diagnostic methodology [10]. Our diagnostic methodology applied on a Mexican public hospital allowed us to understand that the problem of mobility in elderly people and disabled people involves solutions like devices that attend these individuals to achieve movement without many complications. The movement of these patients can be performed routinely or sporadically during their stay in hospital. For patients who require certain routine application of this movement is designed an intelligent monitor system. This intelligent system allows medical experts to program the movements of the robotic bed considering the patient's posture and time. We will show a methodology for bodies classification in real time. Our work considers the problem of human posture classification with few information (sensors), applying digital process to expand the original data of the sensors and so get more significant data for the classification, however, this is done with low-cost algorithms to ensure the real-time execution.},

However, usability research regarding the ease of using these devices, as well as acceptance issues did mostly address aspects of IC-Technologies in younger and healthy users. This study investigates impacts of ageing and domain knowledge on user interaction using the example of diabetes. First, the software for the monitoring of diabetes had been developed and implemented on a PC. The simulated diabetes assistant was displayed on a small screen device as well as on a very large display, simulating an ambient assisted living environment. In a second step, the navigation behavior of younger and older diabetes patients as well as healthy users was assessed. Results show that age and display-size have a big impact on the device interaction, independently of domain knowledge. Furthermore, it was found that simple usage of a bigger screen could be helpful for tutoring patients in using a mobile electronic living assistant.},

abstract={Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},

abstract={Designing healthcare systems for the elderly is a challenging endeavour. Telehealth systems are gaining popularity among elderly users, but such applications are mostly doctor-centric and are predominantly used for managing and/or treating diseases instead of preventing them. They do little to motivate patients to change their lifestyle and proactively manage their health. To address these shortcomings, we propose a web-based telehealth system, which uses Web 2.0 technologies in order to add social support and user defined content. In this study, we determine the functional and interface requirements of the system by conducting open individual semi-structured interviews with eight elderly people of age range 60 to 87. A paper prototype and three interfaces of existing Web 2.0 health applications were used to determine the optimum user interface design of the system. A qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate the responses. Overall, the respondents were positive about the idea of using the web to manage their healthcare from home and made several suggestions such as including applications to manage their diet, physiotherapy exercises to improve their health conditions and simple network games to reduce loneliness.},

abstract={The growing aging population faces a number of challenges, including rising medical cost, inadequate number of medical doctors and healthcare professionals, as well as higher incidence of misdiagnosis. There is an increasing demand for a better healthcare support for the elderly and one promising solution is the development of a context-aware middleware infrastructure for pervasive health/wellness-care. This allows the accurate and timely delivery of health/medical information among the patients, doctors and healthcare workers through a widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks and mobile devices. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of such a context-aware middleware for pervasive homecare (CAMPH). The middleware offers several key-enabling system services that consist of P2P-based context query processing, context reasoning for activity recognition and context-aware service management. It can be used to support the development and deployment of various homecare services for the elderly such as patient monitoring, location-based emergency response, anomalous daily activity detection, pervasive access to medical data and social networking. We have developed a prototype of the middleware and demonstrated the concept of providing a continuing-care to an elderly with the collaborative interactions spanning multiple physical spaces: person, home, office and clinic. The results of the prototype show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context query processing and good accuracy of activity recognition.},

year={2010}, 
pages={367-374}, 
abstract={When a user is in close proximity to a robot, physical contact becomes a potentially valuable channel for communication. People often use direct physical contact to guide a person to a desired location (e.g., leading a child by the hand) or to adjust a person's posture for a task (e.g., a dance instructor working with a dancer). Within this paper, we present an implementation and evaluation of a direct physical interface for a human-scale anthropomorphic robot. We define a direct physical interface (DPI) to be an interface that enables a user to influence a robot's behavior by making contact with its body. Human-human interaction inspired our interface design, which enables a user to lead our robot by the hand and position its arms. We evaluated this interface in the context of assisting nurses with patient lifting, which we expect to be a high-impact application area. Our evaluation consisted of a controlled laboratory experiment with 18 nurses from the Atlanta area of Georgia, USA. We found that our DPI significantly outperformed a comparable wireless gamepad interface in both objective and subjective measures, including number of collisions, time to complete the tasks, workload (Raw Task Load Index), and overall preference. In contrast, we found no significant difference between the two interfaces with respect to the users' perceptions of personal safety.},

Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.},

abstract={Abnormal behaviors such as falls are the most significant issues in ubiquitous healthcare applications for the elderly. The goal of this research is to develop a novel computer vision algorithm, which can allow discriminating between abnormal behaviors and normal daily activities using statistical moment analysis and human shape analysis in daytime and nighttime environment. Many researchers recently presented their work aimed at developing an image sensor based application to detect unexpected fall events. Until now, most studies on the abnormal behavior detection of the elderly have been presented for the systems in daytime. However, they cannot give any solution to detect falls in both daytime and nighttime. To overcome the problem, our method is implemented to distinguish abnormal activities from normal activities. Experimental results show very promising results on test image sequences of normal daily activities and simulated fall activities.},

abstract={Independent living is one of the main challenges linked to an increasing ageing population and concerns both patients and healthy elderlies. A lot of research has focused on the area of ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies towards an intelligent caring home environment able to offer personalized context-aware applications to serve the user's needs. This paper proposes the use of advised sensing, context-aware and cloud-based lifestyle reasoning to design an innovative eHealth platform that supports highly personalized smart services to primary users. The architecture of the platform has been designed in accordance with the interoperability requirements and standards as proposed by ITU-T and Continua Alliance. In particular, we define the interface dependencies and functional requirements needed, to allow eCare and eHealth vendors to manufacture interoperable sensors, ambient and home networks, telehealth platforms, health support applications and software services. Finally, data mining techniques in relation to the proposed architecture are also proposed to enhance the overall AAL experience of the users.},

Currently, this is a well-known problem and therefore multiple ICT-based solutions for falls management exist. In addition, a small part of them are said to help preventing falls, but most of the reviewed solutions doesn't seem to have their focus in reducing specific fall risk factors like loss of muscle mass or a poor balance. The proposed ICT-based fall prevention solution is based on an existing fall prevention exercise programme specifically designed for the Portuguese population. It takes advantage of the smartphone processing capabilities as well as its built-in inertial sensors to evaluate the movements performed during the execution of specific exercises. Using only a simple smartphone it is possible to provide a friendly and inexpensive solution capable of increasing seniors' adherence to fall prevention exercises as well as raise their motivation to properly execute the exercises in their home environment.},

Dementia is one of the common cognitive problems among the elderly population where a basic daily dining activity could be difficult for them to perform. Drinking activities is one of the most important daily needs to keep a person away from dehydrating. Most of the existing works on dining activities recognitions are mainly based on wearable sensors and sensor rich eating utensil. Although the accuracy for sensor based techniques is high, some of the elderly might be reluctant to wear, and some might even forgot to wear altogether. In this paper, we propose a novel system that is purely based on depth data from an RGB-D camera for drinking activities recognition.

abstract={Within the home domain, an outcome of successfully implemented ubiquitous computing is expected to feature an ever-present and - most importantly, convenient to use - ubiquitous home environment. Home automation and wireless sensor networks, as ubiquitous integrations of technology and services at home, are enhancing the quality of life by improved security, information and comfort. We have defined a centric UbiHOMESERVER with three main roles: use of existing interfaces on proprietary systems for remote monitoring and control, serving the surrounding system as a data gateway and providing content-adaptive user interfaces optimised by properties of end-user client devices. Throughout the entire environment, the goal of user interface design is to keep the interaction experience of an end-user as simple and intuitive as possible. In this paper, we present the design of a medicine dose controller, which is our on-going research and development prototype aiming to accomplish this goal. As a ubiquitous device, UbiPILL is targeted to people having problems in remembering to take their medicine on time. Having elderly people in mind, a seamless interoperation between UbiPILL and UbiHOMESERVER has been designed to reliably monitor the medicine box activities by a Web browser of any client device.},

abstract={M-Health monitoring services have attracted more and more attentions especially for senior people. Many people living in elderly homes hope their health conditions to be monitored pervasively so that they could be warned before they get serious diseases. Comparing to traditional medical services which are usually provided within hospitals, m-Health monitoring faces more challenges in personalized health data processing from both views of supporting technology and application mode. In order to achieve personalized and high quality of health monitoring enabled by the new technologies, such as mobile network and cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of m-Health monitoring system based on cloud computing platform (Could-MHMS) is firstly proposed and designed to implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the framework are discussed, which are cloud data storage module, data analysis module, and resource allocation & assignment module, respectively. In data storage module, monitoring data are stored in multiple tenant spaces. Data analysis module uses domain knowledge to assess the monitored persons' health conditions. Service composition method is designed to dynamically allocate and assign public medical resources. These three modules cooperate to implement the core functions during the process of health monitoring which are data collection, data storage, data analysis, and medical resources assignment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our architecture in the environment of elderly homes and show the usability of our method.},

abstract={Fluid intake is an important information for many health and assisted living applications. At the same time it is inherently difficult to monitor. Existing reliable solutions require augmented drinking containers, which severely limits the applicability of such systems. In this paper we investigate two key components of an unobtrusive, wearable solution that is independent of a particular drinking container or environment. We first describe a system for spotting individual instances of drinking (lifting a container to the mouth and taking a single sip) in a continuous stream of data from a wrist-worn acceleration sensor. We show that drinking motion can be detected across different drinking containers (glass, cup, large beer mug, bottle) on a large dataset (560 drinking motion instances from six users, embedded in 5.84 hours of complex natural activities). An average performance of 84% recall at 94% precision was achieved for the drinking motion spotting. Based on the events derived from drinking event spotting, we show how additional information can be obtained. Specifically, we demonstrate the recognition of container types and fluid level from upper body postures during drinking events. Nine containers and three container fluid levels were evaluated to recognize container type and fluid amounts with three users. Recognition rate for container type was 75%, and for fluid level 72%.},

The availability of information about a person's physiological state and daily activity makes it possible to judge their health condition and provide predictive diagnoses and treatment. Therefore, a wireless sensing system for monitoring thermal physiological state in the living environment was developed and its functions were evaluated. The system consists of an ear-worn temperature sensor, two thermo-hygrometers, four skin temperature sensors, and an ECG sensor. The level of data loss in wireless communication was low making it possible to estimate physiological state using more than 10 sensors, even though both the IEEE 802.15.4 radio and the specified low power radio coexist. The system was evaluated for the prevention of indoor heat stroke among the elderly. The thermal physiological state and the location were monitored along with ambient temperature and humidity. We propose a method to detect the activities closely linked with heat stroke prevention and change in physiological state and to give appropriate warnings.},

Corresponding experiments have been set up to collect both ECG data and upper-body accelerations from two healthy participants.

abstract={Surveillance systems are becoming ubiquitous nowadays. Their use is sometimes followed by misuse which often raises ethical questions that have implications for all involved in the design, control, and implementation of surveillance schemes. Spanning across the disciplines of interior design/architecture and camera networks present conceptions of surveillance systems often disregard the social dimension, or those `being watched.' Debates raise concerns as people associate cameras with feelings of fear and control, loss of privacy, discrimination, inequality, and cultural/gender insensitivity. Began as an interdisciplinary collaboration between the University of Minnesota's Interior Design program and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the `Socializing Surveillance' project matured into a joint endeavor undertaken by four faculty advisors and five electrical and computer engineering students through the “ECE 4951: Senior Design” Project in Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. This paper outlines the pertinent issues starting from an optimization approach to place cameras and in-depth interviews with design practitioners that led to a re-thinking of what surveillance and camera networks can entail; the challenges and opportunities afforded through interdisciplinary educational efforts; and the attempts of the team to develop a prototype for an interactive surveillance system that foregrounds the social dimensions of a security scheme. The goal is to ignite interest in surveillance and to set in place considerations for interdisciplinary educational models.},

Ubiquitous and embedded medical monitoring is no longer a myth and this helps improve the daily lives of the sick, elderly, infirm, and chronically ill people. Given the variety of medical body sensors and its applications, it is definitely of interest to implement a middleware system that shield off these differences from the application layer. The aim of this paper is to propose such middleware for wireless medical body area network. The proposed middleware has the ability to support: (i) multiple sensors and applications, (ii) plug and play feature, and (iii) resource management. The middleware has been implemented and the prototype system has been built. The effective uses of the proposed middleware will be shown with the healthcare monitoring system running on top of the middleware.},

abstract={The paper describes the application of a realtime, adaptive battery modelling methodology to Li-ion batteries. This methodology allows accurate estimation of the State-of-Function (SoF) of batteries for an Electric or Hybrid-Electric vehicle. Through use of a Kalman Estimator and online battery model parameter estimation, the voltages associated with monitoring the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery system are shown to be accurately estimated, even given erroneous initial conditions in both the model and parameters. In this way, problems such as self-discharge during non-use of the cells and SoC drift (as usually incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over-charging or ambient temperature fluctuations) are overcome. A further benefit of the adaptive nature of the parameter estimation allows battery ageing (State of Health - SoH) to be monitored and, in the case of safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Moreover, the ability to accurately predict the SoF and changes in battery parameters allows charging scenarios to be optimized to extend lifetime and facilitate future “Vehicle-to-Grid” (V2G) implementation.},

abstract={The dramatic increase of the elderly population causes the impending needs for applying new technology for elderly to improve health conditions and increase the quality of life. With nowadays advance of information and communication techniques which has brought human daily life with great conveniences beyond the limitation of spatial and time constraints, there is no reason that the benefits from these techniques are not applied to the improvement of the healthcare and the increase of quality of life to the older people. Under such a situation, many national-wide projects have been initiated to integrate manpower to address the universal issue. Innovative devices with intelligent sensing capabilities are being developed for providing ambient assisted living to the older people. Fundamentally the assisted living aims to maintain the older people in healthier life style and functional capability, to increase their autonomy and mobility, to enhance their security, to prevent them from isolation and to increase their participation of social network, and etc.. Consequently the functions should be addressed from multidimensional needs. In this talk, an overview of the ambient assisted living is presented from multiple perspectives. Techniques and examples of intelligent sensing will also be presented to demonstrate their applications to ambient assisted living for the older people.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and evolving concept that provides connectivity to the Internet via sensing devices to achieve intelligent identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment. From the assisted living perspective, this emerging concept will enable new communication connectivity routes between elderly disabled patient and care services through innovative networking architectures in AAL environments. M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services.

abstract={Given the growing number of elderly people and patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, monitoring functional activities using wearable wireless sensors can be used to promote the Quality of Life and healthier life styles. We propose a novel and practical solution using three small wearable wireless Functional Activity Monitor (FAM) sensors and a smartphone to store, transmit, analyze and update data. Three sensors, each composed of a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope, are attached to the chest and both thighs. A computationally efficient signal processing algorithm is designed to accurately measure tilting angles. A continuous activity recognition algorithm is developed using a decision tree based on time series data and spectrum analysis; this algorithm can identify activities of daily life in three general categories: (1) postures such as standing, sitting, and lying; (2) locomotion such as walking; and (3) transitions such as sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. The results show an accurate angle measurement compared to the motion capture system Optotrak 3020 and a reliable detection of all activities with sensitivity at least 96.2% compared to video recordings.},

abstract={With the growth in elderly population in Singapore, healthcare expenditure and prevalence of age-related illnesses are expected to increase. Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

abstract={Early detection of fall risk can reduce health costs associated with surgery, rehabilitation, imaging studies, hospitalizations, and medical evaluations. This paper proposes a measurement-focused study oriented to evaluate a new methodology for assessing fall risk using low-cost and off-the-shelf devices. The proposed methodology consists of a data acquisition system, a data analysis system, and a fall risk assessment system. The data acquisition system is composed by a standard notebook computer and video game input devices: a Kinect, a Wii balance board, and two Wii motion controllers. The data analysis system and the fall risk assessment system, in turn, use signal processing, data mining, and computational intelligence methods, in order to analyze the acquired data for determining the fall risk of the subject under analysis. This methodology includes six static and two dynamic tests. Experiments were conducted on a population of 37 subjects: 16 with falling background, and 21 with nonfalling background. These two groups have the same age distribution. As nonlinear binary classification techniques were used, methodologies based on confidence intervals are not applicable and then tenfold cross validation was used to estimate accuracy. Hence, such a methodology can classify the fall risk as high or low, with an accuracy of 89.2%. The proposed methodology allows the construction of low-cost, portable, replicable, objective, and reliable fall risk assessment systems.},

A standard software package is used by health authorities to store the results of the surveys. At present only one data file can be loaded into the dental survey program for analysis at any given time. Analysis of more than one data set at a time is therefore not possible. The overall aims of the collection of vast amounts of clinical data are many. Analysis of data sets containing both clinical and socio-economical data elements are of great interest to senior management of health authorities. The results of data analysis can aid in the planning and provision of dental resources in areas of identified need. To date no evidence is available to suggest that previous efforts to amalgamate and analyse the available epidemiological data have been made. The paper looks at the problems and a possible solution of designing and populating a relational database with the collection of survey data sets},

abstract={In ambient assisted living, one of the most concerning problems is how the living status of the elderly can be accurately judged through the data collected by ambient sensors. To solve this problem, environmental influences should be sufficiently considered. Some researchers have proposed collecting data comprehensively by distributed environmental sensors, but how the massive collected data were to be analyzed and transmitted was ignored. In this article, we propose a local data processing architecture on a local server to analyze collected data. In this three-layer architecture, the latest received data is stored in a data gathering layer. Afterward, a data filtering layer checks the efficiency of data. Also, this layer classifies the received data into static data reflecting sensors' status and a realtime data stream reflecting quality of life. For static data, they are directly stored in a database, and the real-time data stream is divided into different levels. Based on these levels, a data analyzing layer reorganizes data into a neighborhood structure, which will be called RDAA. A risk factor is returned by RDAA and only abnormal data will be sent to a health care provider when its risk factor is larger than a given threshold. LDAP disperses the stress of remote centralized processing and data storage, which decreases the workload of the remote health care provider. Meanwhile, it also reduces network load and improves processing speed.},

abstract={The life expectancy is rapidly growing in many countries. According to the United Nations, the percentage of elderly population will rise from 5% in 2013 to 11% in 2050. The increasing aging of the population implies an increase of age-related diseases, and an increase in terms of health-care costs. The innovations introduced by pervasive computing, and in particular by sensor-based activity monitoring methods, can be exploited to early detect the onset of health issues. For this reason, we devised a novel method to recognize anomalies that a senior performs during the execution of activities of daily living, based on data acquired from unobtrusive sensors deployed at home. The objective is to support the clinicians in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, providing them with fine-grained information about abnormal behaviors. In this paper, we present a demonstration of the method, based on a graphical tool that simulates the execution of activities and abnormal behaviors of an elderly person in a sensor-rich smart home.},

abstract={Wireless sensor technologies can provide the leverage needed to enhance patient-caregivers collaboration through ubiquitous access and direct communication, which promotes smart and scalable vital sign monitoring of the chronically ill and elderly people live an independent life. However, the design and operation of BASNs are challenging, because of the limited power and small form factor of biomedical sensors. In this paper, an adaptive compression technique that aims at achieving low-complexity energy-efficient compression subject to time delay and distortion constraints is proposed. In particular, we analyze the processing energy consumption, then an energy consumption optimization model with constraints of distortion and time delay is proposed. Using this model, the Personal Data Aggregator (PDA) dynamically chooses the optimal compression parameters according to real-time measurements of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) or individual users. To evaluate and verify our optimization model, we develop an experimental testbed, where the EEG data is sent to the PDA that compresses the gathered data and forwards it to the server which decompresses and reconstructs the original signal. Experimental testbed and simulation results show that our adaptive compression technique can offer significant savings in the delivery time with low complexity and without affecting application accuracies.},

abstract={Numerous laboratory based studies have been reported on the use of accelerometry for gait and activity analysis. A drawback of such studies is the use of custom hardware platforms worn by subjects. This paper introduces a system solely utilising accelerometers embedded in off-the-shelf cellular handsets which allow medical professionals and caregivers to remotely monitor the activity characteristics of elderly patients in the home or in the community. The use of ubiquitous cellular handsets makes the system far more acceptable to patients and enables use of the system to be extended beyond primary health-care facilities into the home environment. Mobile handset power consumption issues and other relevant handset characteristics for a variety of different COTS handsets are investigated in the context of deploying this system.},

year={2014}, 
pages={275-278}, 
abstract={Obesity is considered an endemic within the whole European continent, just as in most part of the developed world. Obesity poses an increasing risk, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. To assess the impact of obesity we need to take into account the severity of the problems that obesity might cause, as risk is usually interpreted as the product of probability of occurrence and severity. In the last few decades, increased occurrence of several morbidities was casually linked to obesity. Recently health problems targeting children have increasing trends in well developed countries. Our research is focusing on obesity related health problems in children, and our offered ICT solutions enables healthcare service providers to remotely monitor patient's (children's) activities and weight. The solution also helps to assign workout programs to the children according to the collected sensor data. The used workout programs base not only on widely used sport activities (etc. running or gymnastics), but cover non-conventional sport activities like playing with interactive game consoles at home. The system contains an Android based DAQ (Data Acquisition Device), sensors and a server side portal, which collects all measured patient information in the data center. The solution combines existing; self developed client and server side applications and frameworks, and commodity sensor solutions. The main goal of our work is to adapt the already existing monitoring solution to children. Kids behave and use such monitoring environments differently due to their different perception and knowledge level. They need different GUIs; they live different lifestyle as elderly patients. The communication lines of the system are compliant to the EU and national regulations. The developed system was tested and a prototype system was installed successfully in a real environment. Sensor data acquisition on the personal mobile device - nables both end-users and care givers/professionals to provide better and more effective health monitoring and facilitate patient's treatment. The paper describes the internal architecture of the software solution and its main functionalities.},

year={2009}, 
pages={1-4}, 
abstract={Dementia is a progressive and often gradual decline in mental ability that affects thinking, remembering and reasoning. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, there are many other causes of cognitive decline, such as age related memory loss. Technological and medical advancements have pushed life expectancy higher, thus increasing the number of elderly people and consequently the number of patients that need to be hospitalized. This puts financial pressure on medical institutions which, in conjunction with the shortage of geriatric care professionals, has prompted these institutions to seek various cost-cutting strategies. In particular, technological solutions can address these problems through monitoring and assisting patients with cognitive decline and providing support to their caregivers. The aim is to provide a smart environment that lessens the demand for caregivers to manually assess patients' behavior in specific tasks and hence evaluate cognitive decline. Additionally, within these environments it becomes feasible to implement assistive applications that can support dementia patients while performing everyday tasks. In this respect, this paper proposes the fusion of machine vision and an RFID system that can effectively address the above issues. We will also describe two scenarios that correspond to two different activities the patient can perform and provide an insight into the solutions that are used to support patients and their caregivers in these scenarios.},

abstract={Ambient Intelligence is a new paradigm in information technology to empower people. Such a paradigm that highlights human interaction with machines makes smart technologies a good candidate for development of various real-life solutions in the field of health care, including human activity recognition in smart homes. Since the description of user activity plays an important role in a smart environment, recognition and tracking user activities of daily living can provide unprecedented opportunities for health monitoring, applications, and assistive life utilities, particularly for the elderly, disabled, and people with dementia or Alzheimer disease. Due to sensor data nature with different sampling rates and complex correlations, significant challenges arise due to storage, presentation, exchange and manipulate of this data category. One rational solution to solve such challenges is to use techniques which are based on Semantic Web and Ontology. Recently there have been large varieties of proposed approaches in which they use such techniques. The vast amount of human activity recognition in smart home while using Ontological approaches has made it difficult to make adequate comparisons and accurate assessment. This article presents a framework for analyzing each of the approaches proposed in this regard. Using the proposed SOnAr framework for Ontology-based activity recognition approaches can be effective in analyzing and evaluating different methods in different application areas and dealing with various challenges.},

abstract={The development on newer healthcare services for the elderly citizens has become an immediate necessity today. There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/ abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information. This way the system could increase accessibility, efficiency, and also lower the health expenses to improve the comfort and safety as well as management of daily routines of an elderly life.},

abstract={Rendering and offering adequate reminder services in a situation-aware, proactive manner and providing information for diagnosis support is a major issue for Ambient Assisted Living systems when it comes to dealing with persons suffering from mild dementia. One great challenge therefore is to reliably recognize and assess the long-term behavior of assisted persons. In the context of diagnosis support for caregivers or practitioners, deviations in the daily routine of a person with mild dementia might be an indicator of a deterioration of the affected person's cognitive condition. Based on this information, adequate help can be provided. We developed an approach to processing information regarding the modeling of daily routines and a comparison to previous days. Our solution can be seen as a combination of three approaches: a cosinor analysis based on the theory of circadian rhythms as a special representative of regression analysis, a histogram-based approach based on movement data, and a probabilistic model of behavior (PMB) based on the person's activities of daily living (ADL).},

We adapted a standard computer game currently enjoyed by elders at risk for dementia in order to monitor natural performance on a task that involved significant strategic planning throughout the game. This enabled us to collect cognitive performance data on individuals at frequent intervals. We monitored move-by-move appropriateness as distance to solution, and additionally modeled user thought processes using between-move data from the mouse device. We then used our resulting dynamic user model both to adapt the game difficulty and to detect meaningful individual cognitive trends.},

abstract={Wayfinding ability has a high adaptive value, allowing humans to efficiently explore an environment in order to have a goal-oriented activity. The ability to orient in space starts declining with age and it constitute one of the main signs of cognitive impairment in neurological patients. Spatial orientation decline constitutes however an high limitation for elderly population and it has a great impact on subject the day-life autonomy and on her/his relatives and caregivers. Despite this, the neuropsychological approach on spatial cognition does not allow researchers and clinicians to have an accurate assessment of patient's everyday wayfinding ability. This could be critical in a borderline situation, such as in an age-related cognitive decline, in which spatial stimuli can be correctly individuated even if wayfinding is compromised. The main aim of this contribution is to introduce preliminary data about a spatial evaluation procedure - the VR Maze test - on healthy elderly and Alzheimer's population. This will support the identification of specific treatments able to prevent the cognitive decline in elderly and the rehabilitation of spatial orientation in neurological patients.},

Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

abstract={Falling is one of the leading causes of serious health decline or injury-related deaths in the elderly. For survivors of a fall, the resulting health expenses can be a devastating burden, largely because of the long recovery time and potential comorbidities that ensue. The detection of a fall is, therefore, important in care of the elderly for decreasing the reaction time by the care-givers especially for those in care who are particularly frail or living alone. Recent advances in motion-sensor technology have enabled wearable sensors to be used efficiently for pervasive care of the elderly. In addition to fall detection, it is also important to determine the direction of a fall, which could help in the location of joint weakness or post-fall fracture. This work uses a waist-worn sensor, encompassing a 3D accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, for reliable fall detection and the determination of the direction of a fall. Also assessed is an efficient analysis framework suitable for on-node implementation using a low-power micro-controller that involves both feature extraction and fall detection. A detailed laboratory analysis is presented validating the practical application of the system.},

abstract={The success of integration and adaptation of pervasive computing and telemedicine technology in healthcare depends on the patients' compliance and trust to the introduced system. The aims of the present paper are to investigate, verify and evaluate the elderly heart patients' (EHP) compliance, trust and comfort in relation to a real-time wireless telemedicine system at home. A telemedicine system composed of a patient-unit, a GSM/GPRS network, a router, a data interpreter and a monitoring system was used. Twenty four non risky EHPs, aged (60plusmn5) years were recruited. A week of continuous ECGs for each of the EHPs were recorded. The experiments were carried out while the EHPs were performing their every day's activities. The EHPs' compliance, trust and comfort was verified and evaluated by three questionnaires. In average, 52% of the EHPs scored the user-friendly and usability of the system as reasonable. Only 16% sought help from the healthcare personnel in respect with the application of the patient-unit. 76% scored the reliability of the system as "reasonable" and 20% as "only now and then". It is concluded that the present system is reliable, functions with a clinically acceptable performance. The EHPs have expressed reasonable compliance and trust to the application of the system at home; however a number of the elderly were not satisfied with the weight and the user-interface of the ECG device.},

abstract={In Japan, increases in medical costs and decreases in health care personnel are serious national problems. Against this background, an approach called "preventive care," which aims to prevent increases in the number of persons requiring nursing care, received a lot of attention in recent years. This paper proposes a system for preventive care through game playing with robots. The robots are programmed to behave like humans based on the concept of Human-Agent Interaction. In addition, reinforcement learning is applied to the robots in order to encourage users' competitive spirit and to find an exercise load suitable for each individual user. The proposed system thus allows users to enjoy exercising continuously through match-ups against the robots. With the cooperation of local governments and health and welfare facilities, we investigated the basic characteristics and utility of the proposed system by subjective evaluation targeting the elderly.},

pages={361-366}, 
abstract={Robot social support systems such as robot partner's game interactions with elderly people are very important in ageing societies. Human-robot interaction can decrease the risk of ageing disease such as dementia and thus improve the overall quality of life for the elderly people. However, in order for the robot partner to have successful game interactions with the elderly people, the robot partners need to be equipped with a certain degree of cognitive intelligence to guess the meaning and context of game interactions. In this paper, we discuss a biological stress-inspired model for the robot's cognitive intelligence with dynamic optimisation on its working memory. We name this novel robot's cognitive framework as Advanced Intelligence Cognitive Optimisation (AICO). AICO is a server framework for computational intensive cognitive processing for the smart phone robot known as iPhonoid. We have conducted physical robot experiments with our proposed iPhonoid AICO framework on Rényi-Ulam guessing game with real human subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed AICO framework successfully increased the robot's guessing performance in the game interactions. At the same time, the robot behaves according to its emotional conditions to make the game play interesting for the elderly people.},

"Question First" helps elderly users to transfer their knowledge or experiences by simply answering questions through conventional mobile terminals. The proposed interaction model is based on extending conventional interaction modes of phone calls and em ails, helping elderly users become fam iliar with social networking, without the requirement of learning to use social networking service interfaces. Ultimately, we aim to expand the social participation of the elderly in both online communication and online work such as crowdsourcing. We report the results of a two-week user study on the crowdsourcing of participants' experience and knowledge through online communication, and analyze the information obtained to evaluate the efficiency of this interaction model by extracting features of each participant's knowledge and experience via the proposed method.},

abstract={Care for the ageing population will increasingly be delivered within a domestic setting, so effective integration and sharing at the point of use of accurate and timely personal and social care will be essential. Reliance on the cared-for person to pass on information can be complicated by age-related memory loss and communication difficulties. The Homecare Hub (HCH) concept addresses this issue by providing an in-home care rich-data repository accessible by care providers and family members. Using a wireless handheld device, users can review text, images and audio files stored by previous carers and add their own observations for subsequent carers to access. A home based data repository overcomes many of the issues surrounding remote storage of sensitive information and removes the need to provide Internet connectivity at every point of use.},

abstract={New sensor technologies, powerful mobile devices, and wireless communication standards strongly proliferate ubiquitous and pervasive computing. This is particularly true for healthcare applications. Modern non-invasive unobtrusive sensors enable sophisticated monitoring of the human body. As a result of this monitoring a growing amount of elderly people suffering from chronic diseases will benefit from an enhanced quality of life and improved treatment. Healthcare applications process a vast amount of continuously generated data, this has become a serious challenge. Data stream management addresses this problem in general. However, healthcare applications have additional requirements, e.g., flexibility and reliability. As a consequence, we propose the combination of a sophisticated information infrastructure, called hyperdatabase, and data stream management. Hyperdatabases already allow for reliable process management in a peer-to-peer fashion. In this paper, we elaborate the close relation between distributed process management and data stream management. Further, we show that data stream processing can significantly benefit from an infrastructure for reliable process management. We present the architecture of our prototype infrastructure that supports processing of continuous data streams with a high degree of flexibility and reliability.},

Guidance is performed by division of environment to accessible and inaccessible areas and the motion of walker-user system is constrained inside the accessible area called potential canal. This paper attempts at providing evidence to the fact that loose guide method is an approach to optimal guidance in the sense that when the control (constrain) of ORTW-II motion is loose, its motion pattern significantly resembles user's unconstrained motion. Healthy user's natural motion is hypothesized to be optimal and is compared with constrained motion pattern of ORTW-II for different settings of the potential canal. Experimental results are provided and discussed},

This increases natural decay, diseases, isolation and risk of falls and eventually death. Active-play video gaming, also referred as exergaming, might motivate positive changes in health behavior. However, such games need to take into account the physical characteristics of players and can also be used to foster their social ties. In this paper, we present a long-term intervention, using Action Research, aimed at developing insights for the design of full-body motion-control exergames for older adults experiencing age-related changes addressing problems raised by their motion capacity. The results of our study establish which physical characteristics need to be monitored to adapt gameplay, and other elements of social gameplay and spectator-centered design. Based on our study we present guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in exergames for older adults.},

This paper proposes the introduction of novel enriched linguistic tests and examines the hypothesis that language can be a sensitive cognitive measure for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.},

There are many devices on the market that will analyse one or two signals very well, but there is a considerable need for a device that can bring together a synergy of sensors, producing one coherent snapshot of a patient. Therefore, the proposed system in this paper aims to assemble multiple sensor inputs into one accessible, hand-held device as well as simplifying the gathering and sending of the vital sign data to help support the elderly. The signals collected include: ECG and PPG measurements, blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) and core body temperature. It has also been specifically designed to allow cuff-less estimation of Blood Pressure (BP) and modelling has been done to show its current accuracy. The device will produce meaningful and easy to read results that aim to satisfy both the patient and medical professionals for both quality and quantity of data.

abstract={As older adults age, they are more likely to reside in long-term care facilities due to the decline in cognitive and/or physical abilities that prevent them from living independently. With a rapidly aging population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services, assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan, schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate the specific design considerations and the impressions of long-term care residents, healthcare professionals, and family members on a socially assistive robot designed to autonomously facilitate cognitively and socially stimulating leisure activities. Thematic analysis of focus group sessions conducted at a long-term care facility with the aforementioned individuals revealed important design considerations for the development and integration of a socially assistive robot in long-term care facilities.},

abstract={The high development of medicine causes the world's population aging quickly. To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

abstract={Modern buildings are equipped with multiple systems, which are dedicated to improve quality of living for inhabitants and to facilitate performance of daily duties for maintenance personnel. Yet the variety of the systems causes the bulky informational flow, which may result informational tense to the user, time lost and increase of errors. To make life comfortable in a smart house, the inhabitants of the building should have an access to the simple and intuitive control and monitoring of the apartment, and the maintenance personnel should have a handily informational support for the prioritizing and efficient performance of the maintenance tasks. Thus, there is a need in intelligent management of information flow to provide data to the users with regards to the context like for instance on-going situation and goals, user's intentions, state and role in the system. This paper proposes framework of context-aware middleware as a solution for information management in the system. Context-awareness is achieved with ontological knowledge models of the system and two-level reasoning upon the ontologies. The enabled technologies are discussed with relation to the use case, which is a combination of smart home and elderly care services. Future steps towards framework realization end the paper.},

title={Using duration to learn activities of daily living in a smart home environment}, 
year={2010}, 
pages={1-8}, 
abstract={Recognition of inhabitants' activities of daily living (ADLs) is an important task in smart homes to support assisted living for elderly people aging in place. However, uncertain information brings challenge to activity recognition which can be categorised into environmental uncertainties from sensor readings and user uncertainties of variations in the ways to carry out activities in different contexts, or by different users within the same environment. To address the challenges of these two types of uncertainty, in this paper, we introduce the innovative idea of incorporating activity duration into the framework of learning inhabitants' behaviour patterns on carrying out ADLs in smart home environment. A probabilistic learning algorithm is proposed with duration information in the context of multi-inhabitants in a single home environment. The prediction is for both inhabitant and ADL using the learned model representing what activity is carried out and who performed it. Experiments are designed for the evaluation of duration information in identifying activities and inhabitants. Real data have been collected in a smart kitchen laboratory, and realistic synthetic data are generated for evaluation. Evaluations show encouraging results for higher-level activity identification and improvement on inhabitant and activity prediction in the challenging situation of incomplete observation due to unreliable sensors compared to models that are derived with no duration information. The approach also provides a potential opportunity to identify inhabitants' concept drift in long-term monitoring and respond to a deteriorating situation at as early stage as possible.},

abstract={Research in robotics has made available numerous possibilities and tools for further innovation in the psychological practice. For instance, recent research provided many examples of possible applications of robots in the education and rehabilitation of people with learning difficulties and/or intellectual disabilities. In this paper, we present a study on how cultural backgrounds can influence the perception and intention to use a robot as an instrument in the future practice. The study involved 37 Italian students and 37 UK students, as future professionals in the field of psychology, which experienced the actual capabilities of a humanoid robot through a live demo. In this work, we explored the main factors of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the aim to reveal cultural differences. The instrument used was the UTAUT questionnaire, which was designed and validated to investigate the robot acceptance and use. A significant difference on the intention to use the robot is reported in our results. The discriminant analysis produced a very high degree of separation between the two groups, confirming that there is a different approach toward the use of robotics between the two cultures.},

abstract={Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including but not limited to mild dementia and cognitive disabilities, which require either the institutionalization or the constant support from care-givers. To successfully help the senior citizens, usually a monitoring system is needed that can gather and process data from various sensors about the healthcare condition of the user and environment parameters (noise level, light, humidity and temperature). In this paper we describe a cloud-based approach for monitoring the healthcare condition of senior citizens and the fusion of big data from heterogeneous information flows coming from the sensors. Furthermore, because context understanding is not easily done with a single source of metadata, we analyze metadata available from various online sources, aiming to understand the context of its users, in order to offer them personalized eHealth services.},

title={Acceptance of pervasive healthcare systems: A comparison of different implementation concepts}, 
year={2010}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={While pervasive healthcare systems bear the potential to provide patients with a new quality of medical homecare, the complexity of such systems raises fundamental questions of behavior, communication and technology acceptance. This is especially important, as users of future healthcare systems will be increasingly characterized by diversity. Relying only on highly experienced and technology-prone user groups, which might have been typical users in the last decades, is not sufficient anymore. Rather, elderly users, users with a completely different upbringing and domain knowledge, and ill or handicapped people will have to use the systems. Today, the understanding, in which way physical, emotional and cognitive abilities, caused by individual learning histories and health states, may impact the usage and acceptance of pervasive healthcare technologies, is restricted. This research contributes to this topic by investigating the acceptance motives of aged users with different health states regarding three different implementation concepts for medical technologies: medical technology implemented in mobile devices, smart environments and smart clothing. Using the questionnaire method, a total of 82 users between 40 and 92 years of age were examined regarding their usage motives and barriers with respect to the different technology concepts. Overall, it was revealed that acceptance issues and users' needs and wants should be considered in order to successfully design new medical technologies.},

abstract={Soaring costs and an aging society originate the need for novel technologies in health care sector. Especially telemedicine and AAL systems are often promoted as such. Enabling patients to stay in their domestic environment while reducing costs due to hospital visits seems to be an evaluable opportunity on the one hand but introduces a lot of challenges, like interoperability and security, on the other. Interoperability is the main challenge to put emphasis on, when thinking of networks of medical devices recording patients vital data while acting in a plug-and-play manner. Thus, standards are needed that enable manufacturers to build interoperable medical devices and provide solutions for cost effective and easy to use telemedicine systems. Therefore this paper analyzes the ISO/IEEE11073 PHD standard towards its applicability in such environments, where the focus lies on self-organization and plug-and-play functionality. Furthermore we want to present research done on telemedicine/AAL systems during the SmartSenior project as well as introduce our own ISO/IEEE11073 implementation, which served as a basis for our analysis.},

abstract={Most industrialized countries are facing an important aging of their population. To meet needs of seniors and meet economic and sociological challenges such as the pressure on health support services for semi-autonomous persons, smart home technology is considered by many researchers as a promising potential solution. This approach proposes to use ubiquitous sensors hidden in the environment for monitoring and detecting behavioral abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits and then do a proper guidance by giving hints using many kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.). In a smart environment, assistive system is an important technology in order to fulfill the need to provide support in living environment for people with cognitive deficit. In this paper, we present a new affordable multi-agents assistance system who exploits qualitative spatial reasoning from a combination of RFID localization of everyday life objects and load signature of appliances. We also present promising results of experiments conducted on this new assistance system with real case scenarios of daily living.},

Quantification of drusen size and total area covered by drusen is an important risk factor for progression. In this paper, we propose a method to detect drusen and quantify drusen size along with the area covered with drusen in macular region from standard color retinal images. We used combined local intensity distribution, adaptive intensity thresholding and edge information to detect potential drusen areas. The proposed method detected the presence of any drusen with 100% accuracy (50/50 images). For drusen detection accuracy (DDA), the segmentations produced by the automated method on individual images achieved mean sensitivity and specificity values of 74.94% and 81.17%, respectively.},

The EU project RADIO will design of an old age compliant smart home environment which specializes in fulfilling the needs of elderly people. This is partially achieved through a mobile robot platform which serves as an assistant to the respective elderly person. Apart from this, the robot also functions as a mobile sensor platform.

abstract={In this paper it is suggested to draw a dichotomy among health applications: on the one hand there are health information systems which provide means for dealing with health information, on the other hand there are spatial health applications which provide technical support for the elderly and disabled people. While the former enables health organisations to interchange information and provide patients information about health care, the latter directly supports patients in managing their everyday life. Discussing issues about spatial health applications from the computational point of view a problem is identified. Being grounded on measurements of the spatiotemporal change of objects and especially of people, i.e. their locomotion, spatial health applications are in need of formalisms which are capable of dealing with imprecise spatial information.

abstract={Activity recognition in a home setting is being widely explored as a means to support elderly people living alone. Probabilistic models using classical, maximum-likelihood estimation methods are known to work well in this domain, but they are prone to overfitting and require labeled activity data for every new site. This limitation has important practical implications, because labeling activities is expensive, time-consuming, and intrusive to the monitored person. In this article, the authors use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the parameters of activity recognition models in a Bayesian framework. They evaluate their approach by comparing it to a state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood method on three publicly available real-world datasets. Their approach achieves significantly better recognition performance (p less than or equal to 0.05).},

Since the increasing number of elderly people will live alone, yet requires more smart and automation home services, the proposed framework attempts to develop a smart living helper to improve their later life. Two systems are proposed in the Ubiquitous Healthcare System (UHS) framework including, the Web-based User Remote Management Service (WURMS) and the Multimodal Interactive Computation Services (MICS). The proposed systems are coordinating couple existing audio-visual and communication techniques, including the speech/sound recognition, the speaker identification, the face identification, the sound source estimation, the text to speech (TTS) and the event recognition. For elders' friendly interfaces, the proposed services include, (1) Home care services, (2) Emergency assistance, (3) Family interaction, (4) Remote medical services, (5) Security monitoring, and (6) Information services, to improve the elders' life in more convenience.},

abstract={Results are presented for measuring the gait parameters of walking speed, stride time, and stride length of five older adults continuously, in their homes, over a four month period. The gait parameters were measured passively, using an inexpensive, environmentally mounted depth camera, the Microsoft Kinect. Research has indicated the importance of measuring a person's gait for a variety of purposes from fall risk assessment to early detection of health problems such as cognitive impairment. However, such assessments are often done infrequently and most current technologies are not suitable for continuous, long term use. For this work, a single Microsoft Kinect sensor was deployed in four apartments, containing a total of five residents. A methodology for generating trends in walking speed, stride time, and stride length based on data from identified walking sequences in the home is presented, along with trend estimates for the five participants who were monitored for this work.},

abstract={The Agile Software Development (ASD) process is at the forefront of rapid product development driven by changing customer requirements and a trusted, self-organizing development team. Scrum has become a viable model of ASD focusing on determining immediate deliverables and structuring short timelines, called Sprints, for designing, implementing, and providing them for testing by the customer. While these practices are being adopted by organizations, there is significant difficulty in scaling them to the classroom. Once in place, it is a complex task to evaluate individual student performance based solely on the product outcome and Sprint grade. Thus, there is limited opportunity to catch performance problems that may lead to missing deliverable deadlines or decreasing team trust. In this paper, we impose ASD using Scrum on a senior software projects course in Computer Science. Using a collaborative environment that embeds a social network, project management modules, and event capture system, we perform broad data and event capture and analysis to investigate metrics that are relevant to assessing individual performance aspects related to functioning on an Agile team for software development. Our results suggest that predictive data is available after each Sprint to ascertain individual performance attributes and their relationship to product outcomes.},

abstract={Wearable electronic products measure activity information, it is helpful to improve quality of healthy living. For example, Microsoft band measures heart rate, step, walking distance, and sleep status. However, in some situations wearable devices make people feel uncomfortable, such as elder with dementia. This paper we propose a scheme to estimate sleep status via ambient sensor, i.e., motion sensor, instead of wearable device. The experimental environment deploys motion sensors. Furthermore, participant wears intelligent band in order to collect data of sleep status. We perform training process to sensing data, and desired output in training process is data of sleep status acquired from intelligent band. The experiment results demonstrate that our scheme achieves accuracies of 50% ~ 75% in sleep status estimation via motion sensor.},

abstract={The changing demographic profile of the population has potentially challenging social, geopolitical, and financial consequences for individuals, families, the wider society, and governments globally. The demographic change will result in a rapidly growing elderly population with healthcare implications including Alzheimer type conditions (a leading cause of dementia). Dementia requires long term care to manage the negative behavioral symptoms which are primarily exhibited in terms of agitation and aggression. This paper considers the issues and challenges implicit in the management of Alzheimer type conditions and dementia with a discussion around independent assisted living. Context is introduced with consideration of contextual information and the nature of knowledge. Context processing is discussed. We postulate that the challenges lie in the effective realization of independent assisted living, achieving this remains an open research question.},

abstract={Worldwide elderly population is increasing. Many of these elderly are placed in assisted living environment, and they often need cognitive or physical support in their daily lives. To address such need, a lot of attention have been given from various perspectives such as health monitoring, medication adherence, body-sensor network, smart home for elderly and disabled and so on. However, very less focus has been directed to address the entertainment needs of the elderly, which is an important aspect for an enjoyable living. This paper proposes the design of a context-aware elderly entertainment support system (CAEESS) by investigating the entertainment requirements based on the perspectives of elderly and caregiver. Our focus is on the technical platform to fulfill the identified requirements. The proposed system facilitates the elderly to access various entertainment services through different modes of interaction and also empowers the caregiver to select entertainment media or resources for the elderly when needed. We believe that the proposed approach will provide a clear understanding of the requirements of CAEESS and enable us to effectively address the problems related to the independent and happy living of the elderly.},

As wireless technology becomes more ubiquitous and affordable, applications, such as video-telephony over POTS, will gradually migrate towards third-generation wireless systems. We can also expect to see low-cost miniature wireless circuitry merging with sensor technologies to create a wide range of minimally invasive continuous health-monitoring systems. In some cases, wireless signals alone can be interpreted to monitor vital signs. These techniques promise to greatly improve the cost and convenience associated with long-term outpatient monitoring, and could potentially extend monitoring to the broader healthy population for preventative diagnostics and alerts.},

abstract={The rapidly growing elderly population in many parts of the world has started to impact private and public interests - emotionally, socially and economically. Specifically, current demographics, medical and social trends in the U.S. indicate a large population of older adults being at risk of early cognitive impairment and dementia. This motivates us to design innovative technology solutions for cognitive health assessment, care and well-being in elderly people in their own environments of daily life. Among many significant challenges involved in such technology assisted solutions, an important one is multi-modal sensing and complex sensor data analytics on resource constrained wearable and regularly used daily objects, particularly in the presence of uncertainty and noisy environments. An additional critical challenge is how to transfer the extracted knowledge into actionable information to be effectively used by family members, doctors and caregivers. This keynote talk will present our ongoing research on elderly cognitive care with the help of complex at-home activities recognition with smart wearable, and user emotional behavior signatures detection with smart chair. For activity recognition, our innovative methodology is the first of its kind that detects 21 fine-grained and complex at-home activities by wearable devices, as compared to typical 6-12 at-home activities recognized by relevant works in the existing literature. The smart chair based novel framework can accurately detect user functional and emotional activities, in addition to static and movement based sedentary postures that are more common in current works. In collaboration with Phelps County Regional Medical Center, the proposed solutions are being validated with clinical data and patient studies.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to clarify the relation among the viscosity values of semi-solid diets and the electrical mechanism of gastric motility. Firstly, a measurement procedure suitable for stomach physiology was proposed. A new measurement procedure lessened the psychological and physiological burdens of the subjects, and controlled the cycle of gastric activity of the subjects. And the dispersion of data for subjects was decreased by this new method, in which the measurements were started after 4 hours fasting. Secondly, we prepared five grades of viscosities of fluid to semi-solid diets from low to high viscosity (30 mPa·s ~ 20000 mPa·s) mixed by five different amounts of two kinds of thickening agents. The measurements were performed for 8 healthy volunteer subjects. By evaluating DPr (Dominant Power ratio: Ratio of post/pre-prandial DP values), a significant increment by ingestion of high viscosity semi-solid diets was confirmed in both kinds of thickening agents. DFD (Dominant Frequency Dispersion) was significantly decreased in both high viscosity semi-solid diets. Thus, these results suggested that gastric activity was physiologically stimulated and the cycle of gastric activity became stable by ingestion of high viscosity diets. The results showed that an electrophysiological phenomenon in the evaluation of electrogastrography (EGG) is affected by the viscosity of diets, and also suggested that the difference in the shear rate dependence of diets was not really significant to the electrical behavior of gastric motility.},

The adoption and use of these systems is expected to enable healthcare professionals to remotely perform real-time monitoring, early diagnosis and treatment to patient for potential risky diseases and hence prevent terminal situation. To achieve the aforementioned benefits, private and sensitive patient information is acquired using sensors and other devices. Contrary to other information systems where a patient can decide which information is collected, with U-Healthcare systems, patient has no obligation on that, hence increasing the need for both technical and non-technical measures to control access in these systems in order to maintain patients' privacy. In this extended abstract we consider the need for privacy when accessing sensitive patient information by discussing different access control models developed for U-Healthcare systems.},

abstract={Dementia is a clinical syndrome of cognitive deficits that involves both memory and functional impairments. While disruptions in cognition is a striking feature of dementia, it is also closely coupled with changes in functional and behavioral health of older adults. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of improving the automatic assessment of dementia, by better exploiting the emerging physiological sensors in conjunction with ambient sensors in a real field environment with IRB approval. We hypothesize that the cognitive health of older individuals can be estimated by tracking their daily activities and mental arousal states. We employ signal processing on wearable sensor data streams (e.g., Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), accelerometer (ACC)) and machine learning algorithms to assess cognitive impairments and its correlation with functional health decline. To validate our approach, we quantify the score of machine learning, survey and observation based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and signal processing based mental arousal state, respectively for functional and behavioral health measures among 17 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community in Baltimore. We compare clinically observed scores with technology guided automated scores using both machine learning and statistical techniques.},

abstract={Mobile pervasive healthcare technologies can support a wide range of applications and services including patient monitoring and emergency response. At the same time they introduce several challenges, like data storage and management, interoperability and availability of heterogeneous resources, unified and ubiquitous access issues. One potential solution for addressing all aforementioned issues is the introduction of the Cloud Computing concept. Within this context, in this work we have developed and present a wearable -- textile platform based on open hardware and software that collects motion and heartbeat data and stores them wirelessly on an open Cloud infrastructure for monitoring and further processing. The proposed system may be used to promote the independent living of patient and elderly requiring constant surveillance.},

abstract={In our research we have designed and implemented a ubiquitous home healthcare environment utilizing three novel technologies. We connect portable medical devices and a healthcare gateway via Zigbee which is alow-cost, long-battery-life, and easy-to-setup wireless transmission protocol. Then we convert the Zigbee medical devices into UPnP devices which can be discovered and configured automatically. Finally we manage the software in the healthcare gateway by OSGi with TR-069, so service provider can maintain the system and fix problem without truckroll to user's home. Moreover, to improve the usability, we implement a TV user interface by leveraging the benefit of MHP. User can control the devices via a TV remote controller, and the measurement results displayed on the big screen will be more readable forthe elderly.},

abstract={We have made use of the microbending fiber optic sensor to capture ballistocardiographic signals or data for vital signs monitoring in ambient settings, with applications ranging from serious games to ambient assistive living for ageing at home for the elderly. To remove noise and extract the vital signs, the first step of the signal data processing is filtering the signal. In this paper we consider the properties of the digital filter for filtering ballistocardiographic signals. The vital signs waveforms are derived from raw data captured by optical transducers that are placed in ambient locations that are in contact with, but not worn by the subject. Data has been collected from various locations and positions and a detailed trial has been conducted for one of these positions. We iteratively improve the filter design so as to lead to the best parameters. The baseline filter performed reasonably well on data collected in a trial study, with a mean error rate less than 10% for half of the subjects and below 20% for three quarters of the subjects. We also present results of an improved filter that improves the performance both in terms of responsiveness and sensitivity. The improved filter demonstrates consistently less than 12% mean error rate. Principles gleaned from this study may also be applied in designing filters for other types of sensors and for other applications in healthcare.},

abstract={This paper presents a system for supplying spatial orientation and support to cognitively impaired people in their daily activities. The system is a technological solution based on external aid at a practical level (substitution-based rehabilitation). In particular, we propose a model focused on points of interest or well-known places, in which user-friendly routes to a destination are generated based on the user context rather than the conventional street names and quantitative distances. Moreover, the system offers augmented reality views that include contextual information. This philosophy of navigation more closely matches the needs of the user than do conventional navigation systems; the proposal is especially useful for users who are not accustomed to using new technologies (e.g., elderly people), people experiencing disorientation and, more generally, individuals with a slight cognitive deficit. The system also includes an application that allows the relatives of the user to establish tasks that must be performed at a specific location and to monitor the activities of the user to detect potentially risky situations.},

abstract={Growth of the elder population gives rise to the increasing demand of long-term elder-care facilities. Most elders living in such facilities suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. Accompanying these illnesses are slow declines of the elders' physical and mental health. Continuous tracking of the elders' daily activities is required to detect the declines early. To facilitate long-term mobility tracking of the elders, we investigate, in this work, the potential of a WSN-based indoor location system as a support for the already-overloaded nursing staff. Through the deployment of a WSN-based Real-Time Indoor Location System (WSN-RTLS) in the university hospital's elder care center for 8 months, we find that: (1) each elder's daily mobility shows a reoccurring pattern. The pattern, however, differs from individual to individual. (2) The mobility level shows a significant variability, i.e., not all elders show reoccurring patterns in mobility levels. These suggest that mere quantity of how much the elders move around the facility will not be a suitable target for behavioral modeling. Exact location of the elders' presence, rather, is more relevant. Insitu WSN-RTLSs would be an enabler towards early detection of the elders' physical or mental decline.},

Systems that recognize human activities from body-worn sensors can further open the door to a world of healthcare applications, such as fitness monitoring, eldercare support, long-term preventive and chronic care, and cognitive assistance. Wearable systems have the advantage of being with the user continuously. So, for example, a fitness application could use real-time activity information to encourage users to perform opportunistic activities. Furthermore, the general public is more likely to accept such activity recognition systems because they are usually easy to turn off or remove.},

However, activities to promote such stimulation are often lacking in long-term care facilities. Our work focuses on the use of social robotic technologies to provide person-centered cognitive interventions. Namely, this paper presents an HRI study with the unique human-like socially assistive robot Brian 2.1, in order to investigate the use and acceptability of the expressive human-like robot by older adults living in a longterm care center. Current studies with social robots for the elderly have been mainly directed towards collecting data on the acceptance and use of animal-like robots. Herein, we aim to determine if the robot's human-like assistive and social characteristics result in the elderly having positive attitudes towards the robot as well as accepting it as an interactive cognitive training tool.},

These modules perform together to excite an alert mechanism to the relatives or to the doctors via an SMS or a voice call to their mobile phones, whenever some critical situations arise.

year={2015}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems have become a main part in future internet research. In IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe special tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact between the integrated devices and diverse services. Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies. In this work, we design an IoT architecture for AAL via ICN approach which will effectively improve the performance of communication between the heterogeneous devices and services integrated in IoT-AAL.},

year={1996}, 
volume={14}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1865-1881}, 
abstract={The reliability of InP planar PIN photodiodes in humid ambients has been studied. The dependence of the degradation rate in temperature, humidity and bias was determined by aging devices at temperatures between 50 and 150°C, humidities between 50 and 85% RH, and biases between 2 and 25 V. Failure occurred as a result of a sudden increased dark current. This increase in dark current had little affect on the device responsivity. At all aging conditions the failure distributions were well represented by a lognormal distribution in time with a dispersion of less than 0.3. From these data, an acceleration factor (AF) was developed and is given by AF=exp(E/kT)exp[A(RH)2]exp[B(V)] where E=-0.42 eV, A=-4.6×10-4, and B=-6.7×10-2/V. Extensive failure mode analysis was done on more then 500 failed devices. Based on this, a failure mechanism was proposed. The model requires ingress of moisture to the InP surface. The moisture is reduced at the p-contact region of the device region, giving off hydrogen. Under negative bias In and P react with the hydrogen to form gaseous IH and PH 3. This lead to the semiconductor erosion. The erosion continues until device failure occurs. The worst case concentrate of PH 3 which if created would produce less than 0.1 ppb PH3 per cm3 of air. Thus it is not a fire or health hazard. Finally, we present reliability prediction for nonhermetic PIN's encapsulated in an optically clear silicone based polymer. We estimate a 20 year hazard rate of less than 100 FIT's for devices operating at an ambient of 45°C/50% RH. For comparison, the hermetic counterparts of similar design have a 20 year hazard rate of less than 10 FIT's},

These solutions, which often involve fall detection with accelerometers, are accurate in laboratory conditions but can fail in some real-life situations. To overcome this, the authors present the Confidence system, which detects falls mainly with location sensors. A user wears one to four tags. By detecting tag locations with sensors, the system can recognize the user's activity, such as falling and then lying down afterward, as well as the context in terms of the location in the home. The authors used a scenario consisting of events difficult to recognize as falls or nonfalls to compare the Confidence system with accelerometer-based fall-detection methods, some augmented with context data from a location sensor. The methods that used context information were approximately 30 percent more accurate than those that did not. The Confidence system was also successfully validated in a real-life setting with elderly users.},

abstract={Mobile devices are common and mobile internet access is increasingly possible everywhere in daily life of modern people. Commonly used mobile operating systems are Android, iOS and Windows. Android stands out with its open source nature and working capabilities on inexpensive mobile devices. Real-time location tracking is continuously monitoring a vehicle or a person by using obtained coordinates with GPS, Wi-Fi or Cell-Id. Considering that the client person uses mobile phone with internet on it, location tracking can be done with a mobile application. Therefore, using GPS sensor suffers from rapid energy consumption. This paper presents design and implementation of an android based energy aware real-time location tracking system (EWAREL) using GPS sensor. Its hybrid positioning technique employs other inertial sensors and data sending mechanism for saving energy to be efficient. Introduced EWAREL is a lifesaving application especially for real-time monitoring elderly people suffering from Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's people are monitored with EWAREL application and are prevented from being lost. EWAREL is ready to be generalized for other scenarios such as other health monitoring applications, giving direction, monitoring and directing of field staff.},

abstract={Hypertension is a world wide issue, and it is now generally accepted that its diurnal pattern has a prognostic significance. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel blood pressure (BP) monitoring device that causes less discomfort and is less disruptive of users' daily activities than conventional ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) devices. The proposed device is worn at an ear orifice and measures BP at the tragus. This paper first covers the concept of the device, including the validity of measuring BP at the tragus, and describes the device's newly designed applicator, pad-type cuffs, electric circuit, and pressure reduction method. It then presents a preliminary validation of the basic function as BP measurement device. The developed device causes almost no discomfort and produces signals whose quality is high enough to be used for detecting BP values and useful for health care services.},

One of solution for this problem is to prevent the humans from diseases in order to reduce the medical cost (e.g. by using the hospital as few times as possible). In this research, we have developed a wearable vital sensor which can be used anywhere without disrupting the everyday life of the patient. Furthermore, we have implemented a ubiquitous health monitoring system, which can confirm and share the sensor information received from a cellular phone attached to the wearable vital sensor immediately through the browser.

Dedicated to everyday physiological monitor, we have developed a multi-parameter smart armband which is able record pulse, temperature and triaxial accelerations continuously. With the wearable device and signal processing algorithm, experiments of data acquisition in the daily living have been implemented on the volunteers. The long period record of 38 hours has demonstrated its feasibility of a total record without disturbing. And both historical and cross comparisons on the parameter correlation analysis have proven the valuable health information that the armband could reveal. As an integrated sensor module, the smart armband is simple and non-obtrusive, thus opens a promising approach towards the pervasive health monitor, especially for the elder population.},

abstract={The U.S. has experienced a rapid growth in the use of computers by elders. E-mail, Web browsing, and computer games are among the most common routine activities for this group of users. In this paper, we describe techniques for unobtrusively monitoring naturally occurring computer interactions to detect sustained changes in cognitive performance. Researchers have demonstrated the importance of the early detection of cognitive decline. Users over the age of 75 are at risk for medically related cognitive problems and confusion, and early detection allows for more effective clinical intervention. In this paper, we present algorithms for inferring a user's cognitive performance using monitoring data from computer games and psychomotor measurements associated with keyboard entry and mouse movement. The inferences are then used to classify significant performance changes, and additionally, to adapt computer interfaces with tailored hints and assistance when needed. These methods were tested in a group of elders in a residential facility.},

The sensor system provides reliable location data of humans by measuring slight impedance changes between elements of a thick film sensor matrix under the floor covering. The sensor is completely rigid and undetectable. The low cost and scalable design allows the system to be spread across the whole indoor surface area. The system aims to ensure the efficiency of the elderly care system. Ageing of the population structure in Finland generates an eminent need for more resources in this field. The main pilot sites of the described system are in the senior homes, where the personnel will be most stressed in the near future. The location data can be used for various purposes such as making alarms of senior persons getting up from bed during the night risking them selves of losing balance. Making an alarm during falling down on the floor has an obvious benefit for the habitants of old age homes.},

abstract={Falls are behind many elderly hospitalizations and can lead to injuries that greatly debilitate old patients. Much of the deployed fall detection systems rely on the user wearing a personal emergency response device, being conscious and at home. The limitations of the existing systems regarding usability and efficiency have yield an overarching research question on whether systems based on new and advanced consumer mobile devices can be used as ubiquitous automatic fall detectors for seniors. This paper specifically looks into the accuracy of a fall detection system based on an off-the-shelf smartwatch and smartphone. We have implemented a system which combines threshold based and pattern recognition techniques in both devices, with the intent of having the watch to contribute to the specificity of the fall detection strategy. We tested the accuracy of the system through a series of simulated falls and activities of daily living, resulting on the correct identification of 63% of the falls and 78% of the activities and outperforming two other baseline fall detection applications (iFall and Fade). The sensors and algorithm on the watch were able to provide a marginal contribution to the system's accuracy. Indications from the tests suggest that it should be possible to improve the system accuracy by adjusting the used thresholds and fuzzyfying them. Moreover, it is expected that the open source nature of this work and it's results boost such threshold tuning and serve as a better basis for researchers to benchmark their work.},

The results show that knowledge learning and social interaction have positive effects on both self-efficacy and hedonic experience, self-efficacy also has a positive effect on hedonic experience, and hedonic experience will have a direct impact on behavior intention to use OTG system.

year={2015}, 
pages={145-150}, 
abstract={Generally, post-stroke patients suffer physical disorder or paralysis in various level. Common treatment to restore the functionality of the paralyzed limb is by doing motoric therapy. This therapy was done in hospital and was monitored by therapists. However, most of the post-stroke patients choose not to do therapy since their access to hospital is difficult or their motivation to do therapy is low. To overcome the limitations of traditional therapy methods some interactive game-based therapy systems were introduced i.e: AR-therapy and Wii-based movement therapy. Unfortunately, their performance is low due to user ergonomic factor problem. In this study, we proposed a virtual reality system for sitting to standing and walking therapy for post-stroke patients called KOMY. This application is integrated with Kinect technology. Four VR game-based training tasks were adopted from sitting to standing therapy and walking therapy that was done by therapist. These tasks are sitting-standing-sitting, moving leg aside, moving leg freely, and walking. Each task has tree difficulty level. From observation that involving post-stroke patient, elderly healthy people, and therapist, we find that all of them give positive comment to this application. They said that this application not only can be used for therapy of post-stroke patients but also can be used for exercise to elderly. Further, KOMY can be used as alternative for playing therapy and home education therapy.},

abstract={Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the typical movement disorder diseases, which has a serious impact on the daily lives of elderly people. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PD gait pattern recognition. The key idea of our approach is to distinguish PD gait patterns from healthy individuals by accurately extracting gait features that indicate three aspects of movement function, i.e., Stability, symmetry and harmony. Concretely, our framework contains three steps: gait phase discrimination, feature extraction and selection and pattern classification. In the first step, we put forward a key event based method to discriminate four gait phases from plantar pressure data. In the second step, based on the gait phases, we extract and select gait features that can indicate stability, symmetry and harmony of movement function. In the third step, we recognize PD gait pattern by employing BP neural network. We evaluate the framework using a real plantar pressure dataset that contains 93 PD patients and 72 healthy individuals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline approach by 32.7% on average in terms of Precision, 42.2% on average in terms of Recall, and 24.0% on average in terms of AUC.},

abstract={Mobile platforms are becoming the predominant medium of access to Internet services due to the tremendous increase in their computation and communication capabilities. However, enabling applications that require real-time in-the-field data collection and processing using mobile platforms is still challenging due to i) the insufficient computing capabilities and unavailability of complete data on individual mobile devices and ii) the prohibitive communication cost and response time involved in offloading data to remote computing resources such as cloud datacenters for centralized computation. A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool-a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)-is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data-and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In orderto address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. A thorough experimental analysis aimed at verifying and demonstrating the benefits brought by autonomic capabilities of the framework is also presented in detail.},

abstract={The ongoing demographic changes in the European population are consistently stressing healthcare systems with an increasing number of elderly and chronically ill patients. In order to reach an economically and socially viable solution, home healthcare monitoring systems have been exploited. In this paper, we present the eCAALYX project, a manageable, expandable, inter-operable and low-cost Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solution. Specifically we focus on the Home Gateway component. The eCAALYX Home Gateway relies in the use of open standardized protocols, as well as a modular architecture in order to create an unifying layer between sensors from several manufacturers and different caretaker entities. The performance analysis of our Home Gateway implementation indicates that such a system can run reliably on currently available off-the-shelf equipment, suggesting the practicability of a real-world deployment.},

The system assists caretakers in monitoring the dosing condition via web browser. And Moreover, the system send email to caretakers in order to notify sings of incorrect dosing. The iMec, which is a medicine case developed by us, recognizes medicines in it using camera to confirm the quantity of dosing (e.g. take 3 tablets). The Ubiquitous Sensors, which are sensors embedded in house, assists the iMec in estimating the living state of senior citizens in order to confirm the timing of dosing (e.g. after eating breakfast). The iMec Server accumulates the dosing condition of senior citizens periodically. We confirmed that iMec was able to recognize the 3 kinds of medicines by experiments and iMec System was able to estimate the 7 living states by simulations.},

AAL includes methods, products, services, and software systems to support the everyday lives of elders. To develop AAL software systems, reference architectures (i.e., a special software architecture that guides the development, standardization, and evolution of systems architectures) have been proposed. Despite of the existing reference architectures, their use is a difficult task, due their high level of abstraction. Moreover, these architectures do not support the development of systems for telemonitoring and self-management of chronic diseases at home. The main objective of this project is to propose a reference architecture for Healthcare Supportive Home (HSH) systems.

abstract={Staying physically active is essential to wellbeing in late life. However, many older adults experience barriers to physical activity. Past research has investigated the development of playful interactive systems to support exercise routines and reduce access barriers. Yet, little research has been done on older adults' needs and preferences regarding technologies that support physical activity. We address this issue through an exploration of older adults' exercise motivations grouped around themes relevant to technology design. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 older adults, and followed up with a focus group study of physical trainers and older adults with an active lifestyle. Based on our results, we discuss their conflicting perspectives and challenges on exercise and technology, which leads us to contribute design strategies to support designers as well as researchers wishing to create meaningful and playful fitness applications for older adults.},

As a result, we have been witnessing a significant growth in the number of elderly people around the world. Ensuring a comfortable living environment for elderly people has gained much attention in recent years. By leveraging information and communication technologies, the AAL system shows great promise in satisfying many requirements of elderly people and enables them to live safely, securely, healthily, and independently. Over the last few years various AAL systems, mostly based on Wireless Body Area Network technologies, have been proposed to improve the quality of life of elderly people. Since the information transmitted in AAL systems is very personal, the security and privacy of such data are becoming important issues that must be dealt with. We first discuss the overall system architecture of a typical AAL system and its associated security requirements. Next we propose an efficient authentication protocol for the AAL system and describe how it meets various security requirements. Finally we compare the performance of the proposed authentication protocol with two other recent authentication protocols and demonstrate its superior efficiency.},

pages={149-154}, 
abstract={According to the World Health Organization, the rate of people aged 60 or more is growing faster than any other age group in almost every country, and this trend is not going to change in a near future. Since senior citizens are at high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend will challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive computing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the onset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method relying on medical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and furniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a novel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect first the activities being performed and then the abnormal aspects in carrying out those activities, which are communicated to the medical center. Differently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the system and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an instrumented smart home. Experimental results show that our technique has a high precision while generating a small number of false positives.},

Among existing systems, there is none robust system that can act as a bridge between different systems to facilitate knowledge sharing, so as to empower the detection and prediction capabilities of them. These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them. Storing the information is also a challenge due to a high volume of sensor data generated by each sensor. The proposed HEAL model is a platform that provides services to developers to leverage the previously processed similar data and the corresponding detected symptoms. The proposed architecture is cloud-based and provides services for input sensors, Internet of Things devices, and context providers.

abstract={This paper proposed a method for deploying robotic service coordination for elderly people and caregivers. By showing two kinds of robotic services for them in real environments, we explain what important designs to deploy robotic services are. For this purpose, we utilized an infrastructure, called Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform (UNR-PF), allowing robot service coordination with robots, smartphones, and sensor networks. Three layered architecture of UNR-PF supports developers of personalized robotic services and their coordination to utilize different types of hardware according to characteristics of users. In the case studies of elderly care, robotic services should consider different types of hardware (e.g., wheelchair type) due to characteristics of users; it makes difficulties for design of robotics services.},

abstract={An often unacknowledged yet foundational problem for design is how ‘futures‘ are recruited for design practice. This problem saturates considerations of what could or should be designed. We distinguish two intertwined approaches to this: ‘pragmatic projection’, which tries to tie the future to the past, and ‘grand vision’, which ties the present to the future. We examine ubiquitous computing as a case study of how pragmatic projection and grand vision are practically expressed to direct and structure design decisions. We assess their implications and conclude by arguing that the social legitimacy of design futures should be increasingly integral to their construction.},

However, the main target audiences of the existing digital games are young generations, who do not warrant the special needs required by elderly. In this paper, based on the field study of game for elderly - Chinese Water Painting - we propose a curious companion for the elderly. The curious mechanism of the artificial companion is developed based on Berlyne's model of curiosity. The implementation considers three needs of the elderly: the smoothness of game playing, the entertainment, and the caring for the elderly. A preliminary study suggests a wide range acceptance of the curious companion.},

Since technology-based innovations can only be successful if they actually reach people, an interdisciplinary approach is followed to support engineering and science chairs and bodies with concept development and evaluation.

By hiding technology into light fixtures, in this paper we propose AmbLEDs, a mobile ambient light sensing system, as an alternative to spreading sensors that are perceived as invasive, such as cameras, microphones, microcontrollers, tags or wearables, in order to create a crowdware ubiquitous context-aware system for recognizing, informing and alerting home environmental changes and human activities to support continuous proactive care.},

year={2015}, 
pages={65-71}, 
abstract={According to statistics, one in every three adults ageing 65 or older falls every year. Every fall may lead to long-term consequences due to fractures or even neurological damages. These consequences have severe impact in their quality of life, independence and confidence, ultimately increasing the risk of early death. Moreover, the risk of falling increases as age advances. Fortunately, several studies reveal that specific exercise programmes may help in reducing the risk of falling if performed correctly and frequently. However, user engagement and adherence to these programmes are still low mainly due to motivational factors, since interventions are usually long, unadapted and unchallenging. In this paper, a new solution is presented, which uses the concept of interactive games using motion sensors to tackle low adherence (through gaming motivation) and help in physical rehabilitation and reduce fall risk on elderly people by improving balance, muscle strength and mobility. It is intended to be used in community or domestic unsupervised contexts and supports relatively inexpensive sensing equipment (currently Kinect®, Leap Motion®, Orbotix Sphero® and Smartphones) and common platforms (desktop and mobile). Tests were already undertaken with several individuals ageing 65 or more and the results were analysed and discussed, being generally positive, despite some issues in the movement detection algorithms.},

pages={72-72}, 
abstract={Ubiquitous healthcare applications envision future computing and networking environments as being filled with sensors that can determine various types of contexts of its inhabitants, such as location, activity and vital signs. While such information is useful in providing context-sensitive services to the inhabitants to promote intelligent independent living, however in reality, both sensed and interpreted contexts may often be ambiguous. Thus, a challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services is the ability to handle ambiguous contexts to prevent hazardous situations. In this paper, we propose a framework which supports efficient context-aware data fusion for healthcare applications that assume contexts could be ambiguous. Our framework provides a systematic approach to derive context fragments, and deal with context ambiguity in a probabilistic manner. We also incorporate the ability to represent contexts within the applications, and the ability to easily compose rules to mediate ambiguous contexts. Through simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for monitoring elderly people in the smart home environment.},

abstract={Gait analysis is nowadays considered, as a promising contributor towards early detection of cognitive and physical status deterioration when it comes to elderly people. However, the majority of recent efforts on indoor gait analysis methodologies are limited as they only exploit the average walking speed. Applying density based clustering algorithms on indoor location datasets could accelerate context awareness on gait analysis and consequently augment information quality with regard to underlying gait disorders. This work presents the application of DBScan, a well-known algorithm for knowledge discovery, on indoor Kinect location datasets collected in the Active and Healthy Aging Living Lab in the Lab of Medical Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The aim of the paper is to provide evidence that such an approach could effectively discriminate indoor activity High Density Regions which may subsequently be transferred to datasets originated from seniors' real homes in the light of context aware gait analysis.},

CAPSIL is an FP7 Coordinating Support Action that incorporates a strategic international coalition of University and Industrial partners that already have extensive teams developing hardware/software/knowledge solutions to independent living based on user requirements. CAPSIL has two fundamental goals: 1. To carry out an analysis of the state of the art with regards to technology, healthcare and public policy in the EU, US and Japan for enabling independent living for older adults. Based on this analysis, develop a detailed roadmap for EU research to achieve effective and sustainable solutions for independent living 2. To support aging research by proposing procedures to incorporate all of these diverse solutions into WiKi entries (CAPSIL WiKi). It is our hope that these CAPSIL WiKi's will enable researchers and the ICT industry to get the information they need to quickly and easily test solutions for prolonging independent living within the many and various heterogeneous communities. In this paper we will summarise the principal findings of the CAPSIL Roadmap and present an overview of the main research gaps and recommendations for policy and research development.

The Heads in the Game outreach and research program was developed to motivate STEM education and empower students through their love of sports. Sixteen rising junior and senior scholars participated in a month-long program where they attended seminars on coding methodologies, biomedical and computer engineering, health and sports performance, concussion protocols and impact detection devices, applications in telemedicine, and principles and practices of scientific research methods. Heads in the Game scholars used the skills gained in order to perform research in student athlete healthcare. Scholars conducted interviews with athletic trainers, medical professionals, and coaches, and applied the skills learned in the seminars towards the development of a program for an improved athletics digital health information infrastructure. We objectively report the results of the student outreach process, seminars, research methods, research accomplishments, and how the scholars have applied what they learned in their communities.

abstract={The ePAL initiative aims at developing a roadmap for extension of professional active life of the retiring and retired knowledge workers in Europe. Three specific perspectives are identified in this roadmap, and defined to comprehensively address relevant dimensions of the ePAL environment. These include: (1) the technological perspective that addresses both the needed technology and the support services, (2) the societal perspective that addresses both the human factors and the societal aspects, and (3) the Organizational perspective that addresses both the economical managerial aspects and the governmental aspects of these environments. This paper however aims to zoom in on the technological perspective of the ePAL. It introduces the four main ICT research and development areas that are identified for strengthening and realization of active ageing. The technological perspective of the ePAL's vision constitutes a substantial part of the ePAL roadmap recommendation results. The paper further addresses the state of the art in each of these four areas and exemplifies their application needs in the ePAL environment.},

To realize a gentle and safe supervision, we have to consider social relationships between observers and the watched person to give adequate level of privacy to the services. We propose "uEyes", a ubiquitous supervisory system that introduces a new feature for the supervision, i.e., social context awareness. By using this feature, environmental information acquired from real world and knowledge on social activities of people are integrated effectively. From experimental results using a prototype of uEyes for supervising elderly people, we show that the social context awareness, as well as other components of the system, effectively works to support the supervision.},

abstract={A methodology for mapping in-home gait speed (IGS), measured unobtrusively and continuously in the homes of older adults, to Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) time is presented. A Kinect-based gait system was used to collect in-home gait data on 15 older adults over time periods of up to 16 months. Concurrently, the participants completed a monthly clinician administered fall risk assessment protocol that included TUG and habitual gait speed (HGS) tests. A theoretical analysis of expected performance is presented, and the performance of the IGS-based TUG estimates is compared against that of estimates based on HGS measured at the same time as the TUG. Results indicate that the IGS-based estimates are as accurate as the HGS-based estimates as compared to the observed TUG times. After filtering the TUG times to reduce noise, the IGS-based estimates are more accurate. The mapping of in-home sensor data to well studied domains facilitates clinical interpretation of the in-home data.},

abstract={Many older adults in the US prefer to live independently for as long as they are able, despite the onset of conditions such as frailty and dementia. Sensor networks have emerged in the last decade, together with telehealth and internet based electronic health records (EHR), as a possible solution to older adult health monitoring. Many commercial solutions for EHRs, telehealth monitoring and sensor networks are available but, as far as we know, no integrated system exists. In this paper we present an integrated eldercare EHR system (IEEHR) that merges health data with sensor and telehealth (vital signs) measurements. The benefit of an EEHR system is three fold: provides physicians a wider gamut of tools for chronic disease management, reduces nursing workload and allows the development of health context aware algorithms for predictive health assessment. In this paper we present the integrated EEHR system we are developing at TigerPlace, an assisted living community in Columbia, Missouri. Several examples of possible applications are also presented.},

abstract={Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in elderly patients is critical and important since this disease became a major public health problem. It is well known the fact that osteoporotic fractures may occur as a result of a combination of the degeneration of trabecular structures and low bone mass. Therefore, the quantitative analysis of human bone trabecular architecture might be useful for treatment and diagnosis of this disease. synchrotron radiation X-Ray micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) enables magnified images with a high space resolution that allows detailed analysis of the trabecular structure. In the quantitative analysis of medical images of human bone, it is necessary to use filters and binarization, nevertheless these techniques may cause loss of information. This paper describes the alternative application of neural computing (artificial neural networks) to the pixel classification in order perform the quantitative analysis of human bone trabecular structure in synchrotron radiation μCT images obtained at the Synchrotron Radiation for Medical Physics (SYRMEP) beam line of the ELETTRA Laboratory at Trieste, Italy. Results demonstrate that, despite the complexity of the trabecular architecture, the ANNs have considerable success in the recognition of bone pixels for the quantitative analysis and that its use is compatible to the characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation images.},

abstract={The ever growing percentage of elderly people within modern societies poses welfare systems under relevant stress. In fact, partial and progressive loss of motor, sensorial, and/or cognitive skills renders elders unable to live autonomously, eventually leading to their hospitalization. This results in both relevant emotional and economic costs. Ubiquitous computing technologies can offer interesting opportunities for in-house safety and autonomy. However, existing systems partially address in-house safety requirements and typically focus on only elder monitoring and emergency detection. The paper presents ANGELAH, a middleware-level solution integrating both "elder monitoring and emergency detection" solutions and networking solutions. ANGELAH has two main features: i) it enables efficient integration between a variety of sensors and actuators deployed at home for emergency detection and ii) provides a solid framework for creating and managing rescue teams composed of individuals willing to promptly assist elders in case of emergency situations. A prototype of ANGELAH, designed for a case study for helping elders with vision impairments, is developed and interesting results are obtained from both computer simulations and a real-network testbed.},

Monitoring of the elderlies and physically impaired, sports medicine, and physical therapy, are some of the active research areas in telerehabilition. Furthermore, the gaming industry has provided some low-cost devices to track motion with reasonable accuracy, thus, making telerehabilition a reality for patients who need it. This project investigates the feasibility of using the Nintindo Wii Remote Controller as a handheld device that patients can use to perform repetitive motions in physical therapy sessions in a telerehabilitation setting. Patients can use such an instructional (or e-learning) system at home without the cost, effort, and time associated with visiting a medical office. At the same time, the public health care system also benefits from the deployment of these telerehabilitation systems.},

The system can support correct dosing of recipient and dosing monitoring of their caretakers. The iMec is a medicine case that not only detects medicine in the medicine case by image processing but also notifies about dosing timing and dosage by touch display and speaker. The ubiquitous sensors assist the iMec to decide dosing timing. We have confirmed the validity of the image processing methods by experiments.},

It can also enhance the quality of life for elderly people and chronic patients, and decrease the harm of the sudden diseases. The paper presents a distributed wireless body area network for medical supervision. The system contains three layers: sensor network tier, mobile computing network tier, and remote monitoring network tier. It provides collection, demonstration, and storage of the vital information such as ECG, blood oxygen, body temperature, respiration rate. Furthermore, it also provides medical service management and disease warning. The system has many advantages such as comfort, low-cost, low-power, easy configuration, convenient carrying, easy transplantation, real-time reliable data, and friendly human-machine interaction.

In this paper, we describe a system that can automatically monitor dressing activity and identify dressing failures exhibited by patients. The system uses a synergistic combination of RFID and computer vision in order to identify a number of common dressing failures exhibited by the patients.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living technologies try to integrate intelligent assistance-systems in elder people's homes to maintain a high degree of independence, autonomy and dignity. To speed up the development process and to make the applications more adaptive and flexible to special user needs as well as to ensure compatibility throughout systems a common middleware with standardized interfaces is desirable. The integration of off-the-shelf sensor hardware is an important aspect to assure longterm applicability and interoperability. AIT Austrian Institute of Technology has developed a modular software platform providing services to enable independent living for elder people at home. The platform is based on state-of-the-art software development techniques like OSGi and Spring, which enable modularity and flexibility. The aspect of interoperability at the hardware level is considered by integrating standards from the two areas of medical informatics and home automation. A hardware abstraction module harmonizes data from different sensor networks in terms of a common data format. Based on sensor data, functionalities for the detection of specific events and situations in the AAL domain have been implemented using finite state machines and simple statistical methods.},

abstract={Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},

abstract={Nowadays, recognizing human activities is an important subject; it is exploited widely and applied to many fields in real-life, especially health care or context aware application. Research achievements are mainly focused on activities of daily living which are useful for suggesting advises to health care applications. Falling event is one of the biggest risks to the health and well being of the elderly especially in independent living because falling accidents may be caused from heart attack. Recognizing this activity still remains in difficult research area. Many systems which equip wearable sensors have been proposed but they are not useful if users forget to wear the clothes or lack ability to adapt themselves to mobile systems without specific wearable sensors. In this paper, we develop novel method based on analyzing the change of acceleration, orientation when the fall occurs. In this study, we recruit five volunteers in our experiment including various fall categories. The results are effective for recognizing fall activity. Our system is implemented on Google Android smart phone which already plugged accelerometer and orientation sensors. The popular phone is used to get data from accelerometer and results show the feasibility of our method and contribute significantly to fall detection in Health care.},

abstract={The changing demographic profile of the population has potentially challenging social, geopolitical, and financial consequences for individuals, families, the wider society, and governments globally. The demographic change will result in a rapidly growing elderly population with healthcare implications which importantly include Alzheimer type conditions (a leading cause of dementia). Dementia requires long term care to manage the negative behavioral symptoms which are primarily exhibited in terms of agitation and aggression as the condition develops. This paper considers the nature of dementia along with the issues and challenges implicit in its management. The Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are introduced with factors (precursors) to the onset of agitation and aggression. Independent living is considered, health monitoring and implementation in context-aware decision-support systems is discussed with consideration of data analytics. Implicit in health monitoring are technical and ethical constraints, we briefly consider these constraints with the ability to generalize to a range of medical conditions. We postulate that health monitoring offers exciting potential opportunities however the challenges lie in the effective realization of independent assisted living while meeting the ethical challenges, achieving this remains an open research question remains.},

abstract={Ubiquitous and pervasive applications are aware of the context of the used resources. This class of application can benefit from mechanisms to discover resources (devices and sensors) that meet their requirements and mechanisms to monitor the state and provide access to the functionalities of these resources. We present an architecture that includes two essential services to compose the supporting infrastructure required by the mentioned applications: a context service, that provides access to context information, and a discovery service. Resource agents, which encapsulate and provide access to the actual resources and sensors, are also included in the proposal. A reference implementation, based on Web services technology, was used to develop a remote assisted living application, which relies on ambient sensors, placed in each room, to capture context information and on a combo medical appliance to perform blood pressure measurements on the patient, according to a care plan prescribed by a doctor. The collected set of context data may be transmitted to a monitoring center and also interpreted locally using medical knowledge; the identification of a patient's abnormal condition can activate local actions or send an emergency message to a monitoring center. The local infrastructure can help a doctor to monitor and assist the patient while he or she is performing daily activities. It may also help reducing hospitalization time and improving the patientpsilas treatment compliance and quality of life.},

It can aggravate other type of failures and degradations of the device and lead to ultimate failures.

In this research, different power dissipation conditions and ambient temperatures are discussed. Their impacts on the thermal impedance has been studied with FEA simulation and validated by the experimental results. This reveals the interplay between thermal impedance and these conditions. Furthermore, the health conditions of DCB substrate solders of the IGBT modules are altered by the aging test. The changes of junction temperature and thermal impedance are compared for solder layer in both health and fatigue conditions. This confirms the validity of the proposed condition monitoring method for vehicle-ready IGBT power modules.},

abstract={In the recent years several studies on population ageing in the most advanced countries argued that the share of people older than 65 years is steadily increasing. In order to tackle this phenomena, a significant effort has been devoted to the development of advanced technologies for supervising the domestic environments and their inhabitants to provide them assistance in their own home. In this context, the present paper aims to delineate a novel, highly-integrated system for advanced analysis of human behaviours. It is based on the fusion of the audio and vision frameworks, developed at the Multimedia Assistive Technology Laboratory (MATeLab) of the Università Politecnica delle Marche, in order to operate in the ambient assisted living context exploiting audio-visual domain features. The existing video framework exploits vertical RGB-D sensors for people tracking, interaction analysis and users activities detection in domestic scenarios. The depth information has been used to remove the affect of the appearance variation and to evaluate users activities inside the home and in front of the fixtures. In addition, group interactions are monitored and analysed. On the other side, the audio framework recognises voice commands by continuously monitoring the acoustic home environment. In addition, a hands-free communication to a relative or to a healthcare centre is automatically triggered when a distress call is detected. Echo and interference cancellation algorithms guarantee the high-quality communication and reliable speech recognition, respectively. The system we intend to delineate, thus, exploits multi-domain information, gathered from audio and video frameworks each, and stores them in a remote cloud for instant processing and analysis of the scene. Related actions are consequently performed.},

In this paper, we present an automatic fall detection system called VAMPIR based on a vertical array of multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors. PIR sensors provide an inexpensive way to recognize human activity based on its infrared signature. To differentiate between falls and other human activities such as walking, sitting on a chair, bending over etc., we used a pattern recognition algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMM). We obtained encouraging classification results on a pilot dataset that contained 42 falls and multiple non-fall human activities performed by trained stunt actors.},

abstract={Healthcare is increasingly a collaborative effort involving caregivers from several different organizations providing services to the same patient. This is particularly the case in care for the elderly and chronically ill, where a preference for care in the home is common. Current systems lack support for care scenarios that require mobility and intra-organizational collaboration. This results in an inefficient work situation that relies on old technologies - paper notes, phones calls, fax - for communication, which ultimately threaten the medical safety of patients. In this paper we present a system designed for this collaborative situation covering both mobile work in a single organization (home care) and collaboration across organizations, as well as connecting devices to people. Although developed as part of a research project, the use of participatory design and iterative development has resulted in early adoption of the system which is now in professional use by both the participating hospital and municipality.},

A challenge for such a solution is the development of context-awareness through the multidimensional, dynamic and nonlinear sensor readings that have a weak correlation with observable human behaviours and health conditions. To address this challenge, a wearable sensor system with an intelligent data forwarder is discussed in this paper. The forwarder adopts a Hidden Markov Model for human behaviour recognition. Locality sensitive hashing is proposed as an efficient mechanism to learn sensor patterns. A prototype solution is implemented to monitor health conditions of dispersed users. It is shown that the intelligent forwarders can provide the remote sensors with context-awareness. They transmit only important information to the big data server for analytics when certain behaviours happen and avoid overwhelming communication and data storage. The system functions unobtrusively, whilst giving the users peace of mind in the knowledge that their safety is being monitored and analysed.},

abstract={Dynamicity is one of the main challenges in providing sustainable solutions for the homecare domain. The dynamicity of homecare systems, caused by external entities like care-receivers and care-givers, can be addressed through combining distributed and heterogenous services both in design and runtime. In general, several research fields such as dynamic service composition, context-aware service composition and dynamic configuration contribute to provide solutions to handle the dynamicity. However, the dynamicity requirements and constrains in homecare domain demands its own solutions. In this paper, we explain our understanding of a homecare provisioning platform and its external entities which interact with the platform. Based on our application scenario and literature study, we identify different types of changes which are imposed by the external entities. Moreover, the characteristics of the external entities, which need to be taken into account to address the dynamicity, are discussed. Then, we study the existing dynamic service composition approaches to see their feasibility for the homecare domain. Finally, we explain our motivation for choosing a hybrid service composition approach as our basis for the homecare provisioning platform with respect to the identified changes and characteristics coming from the external entities.},

pages={914-917}, 
abstract={It is difficult for patients and their families to evaluate the stage of recovery from hemiplegia caused by a stroke because expert knowledge is necessary to evaluate them. However, if patients and their families without expert knowledge can ascertain how and to what degree they are recovering, it would facilitate the setting of a goal of rehabilitation into society and produce a voluntary training scheme. Therefore, we developed an inexpensive, portable, and maneuverable rehabilitation system using a personal computer and an oversized game controller, which is easy for a paralyzed person to operate. Applying the button-press game, which is the easiest game among those offered with the system, to healthy adults, elderly people without paralysis, and patients with hemiplegia, we measured reaction time and obtained other data. Results show significant differences between the healthy adults and the elderly people without paralysis, and between the healthy adults and the patients with hemiplegia, which suggests that we can evaluate how much a patient is recovering from hemiplegia quantitatively by comparing the reaction times used for maneuvering the system among healthy adults, elderly people, and patients with hemiplegia.},

abstract={Many studies have reported that older adults with glaucoma experience mobility issues due to gait difficulties. These include walking slowly and bumping into obstacles, which increase the risk of falls in glaucoma patients. In this paper, we design and develop a shoe-integrated sensing system as well as signal processing and machine learning algorithms to objectively quantify gait patterns in glaucoma patients. The sensor platform was utilized in a randomized clinical trial involving 9 glaucoma patients and 10 age-matched healthy participants performing a series of gait tests. Sensor signals are collected wirelessly and processed on a local computer. With the captured data, we develop data analysis techniques to make a comparison between gait characteristics in older adults with or without glaucoma. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system achieved an accuracy of more than 90% in distinguishing gait patterns of those with glaucoma from healthy individuals for various gait analysis tests.},

Considering global social issues such as aged society besides the technologies, senior citizens suffering from memory loss would be one of potential user groups. Since the use of eyeglasses among the elderly is quite common, we have constructed a navigation interface on eyeglasses by implanting a set of light emitting diode indicators on the frame of the glasses. We aim to realize eyeglasses-based navigation system that provides the elderly with the visual cues and could be interpreted intuitively as navigational commands. Furthermore, we believe that our system would improve the independent mobility of the elderly. This paper explains our first prototype glasses with near-eye LED indicators, incremental experimentation, and the preliminary results that are used to optimize the visual cues for real navigational tasks. The system was evaluated in simulated navigational tasks by the elderly participants suffering from dementia.

We propose an alternative paradigm in which continuous, unobtrusive monitoring is used to observe changes in physical behavior over time. We highlight the use of this technique for monitoring motor activity that may be predictive of early cognitive changes in the elderly. Initial results using a system of low-cost wireless sensors are presented, together with a discussion of appropriate analyses and interpretation of such data. Using low-cost wireless sensor network coupled with algorithms to detect changes in relevant patterns of behavior, we are able to detect both acute and gradual changes that may indicate a need for medical intervention.},

abstract={To promote independent living for elderly population activity recognition based approaches have been investigated deeply to infer the activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADLs). Deriving and integrating the gestural activities (such as talking, coughing, and deglutition etc.) along with activity recognition approaches can not only help identify the daily activities or social interaction of the older adults but also provide unique insights into their long-term health care, wellness management and ambulatory conditions. Gestural activities (GAs), in general, help identify fine-grained physiological symptoms and chronic psychological conditions which are not directly observable from traditional activities of daily living. In this paper, we propose GeSmart, an energy efficient wearable smart earring based GA recognition model for detecting a combination of speech and non-speech events. To capture the GAs we propose to use only the accelerometer sensor inside our smart earring due to its energy efficient operations and ubiquitous presence in everyday wearable devices. We present initial results and insights based on a C4.5 classification algorithm to infer the infrequent GAs. Subsequently, we propose a novel change-point detection based hybrid classification method exploiting the emerging patterns in a variety of GAs to detect and infer infrequent GAs. Experimental results based on real data traces collected from 10 users demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of GAs classification by over 23%, compared to previously proposed pure classification-based solutions. We also note that the accelerometer sensor based earrings are surprisingly informative and energy efficient (by 2.3 times) for identifying different types of GAs.},

abstract={Recently, patients suffering from a set of physical and mental limitations, called co-morbidities, are often treated at home. In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.},

abstract={The present study explores perceived relevance of security and privacy aspects in different user groups and assesses the predictive power of these attributes on acceptance of medical assistive technologies. Based on previously conducted focus groups a questionnaire was developed and quantitative data from N = 104 persons were analyzed. In a descriptive manner opinions of adults in all stages of life (age groups from young, middle-aged to older people) as well as gender - and health-related are presented and discussed with regard to those characteristics, and differences between the groups are disclosed. In multivariate regressions follows the analysis of most predictive security and privacy attributes for the acceptance (i.e. perceived usefulness) of E-health technologies. Results show that both security and privacy aspects play an important role for acceptance and usage of medical assistive technologies.},

title={Towards Adaptive Decision Support for Individual Persons Suffering from Chronic Diseases}, 
year={2012}, 
pages={225-229}, 
abstract={This paper presents the concept of an adaptive decision support system for individual persons (ADSIP). ADSIP will serve as a diagnosis assistant for a smart wearable computing system and aims to provide elderly people suffering from chronic diseases with reliable health status diagnosis in real time. The smart wearable computing system addresses unobtrusive and long-term home and outdoor health monitoring, for the purpose of supporting elderly people in leading an independent life with more mobility, flexibility, and safety. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is chosen as the initial application domain. To achieve reliable health status diagnosis, the proposed approach for ADSIP is to individualize the decision support system by means of learning an individual person's health characteristics repeatedly at certain time intervals from measured sensor data and user input, so that a dynamic decision-theoretic model can be adapted gradually to this person's individual health condition. It is expected that with ADSIP, measured deviations from the norm can be categorized either as a critical situation or as a normal uncritical variation, depending on an elderly person's individual health characteristics. As a consequence, false positive health status diagnoses will be reduced and false negative diagnoses will be avoided.},

abstract={The birth rate in Taiwan is lagging behind most countries due to the decline of youngster and juvenile population. On the other hand, the advance in health care prolongs the elderly life that in turn causes side effect of increasing healthcare cost to government and elderly family. Unfortunately, most seniors are prone to deteriorating health, which may result in mental or physical impairment. Therefore, research in senile diseases will definitely become active. This study puts emphasis on the prophylaxis of elderly health care, especially the cognition related issues. Several systems, including visual, audio, and memory tests, are designed on Tablet PC for elderly to self evaluate their health status. The advantages of the proposed systems lie in providing the elderly handy tools to perform the evaluation without going back and forth to the hospital, receive the test results immediately, and retrieve the records anytime at home. The results from the proposed systems are compared with other methods to verify their effectiveness and practicality in early evaluation of senile dementia.},

abstract={Falls are the leading cause of disability and injury-related deaths among older adults, resulting in over 1.6 million annual emergency hospitalizations in the United States. Fall detection devices often rely on dramatized falls when developing algorithms. This study used tri-axial accelerometers worn by older adult research subjects in order to (1) collect false positive data (2) capture potential fall events and (3) evaluate the usability of the device among this target population. Twelve older adults wore activity monitors while participating in structured and unstructured activities. The study collected data on 120 patient days, yielding 492.5 hours of monitored time. Actigraphy data of annotated activities were used to define parameters for refining the algorithm. No falls occurred during the study, but valuable false positive data were collected. The study also obtained information on the usability of the devices and revealed user perspectives on commercializing the final product.},

abstract={A recent social problem in Japan is domestic accidents involving elderly persons, who are increasingly living alone. Domestic accidents are unpredictable emergent situations, yet the constant care of elderly person by non-relatives or caregivers is difficult due to associated labor costs, privacy problems, and burdens placed on elderly persons themselves. This paper targets trip and fall, the leading cause of accidental death in elderly persons, and examines a detection method for such accidents. To address privacy issues, we use a Doppler sensor that can detect movement without the use of personally identifying data. We also investigate the movement detection and identification by frequency analysis of sensor output using fast Fourier transform. In addition, we design and implement a prototype terminal to detect trip and fall by using a Doppler sensor and an embedded computer.},

The use of miniature sensors placed in the environment or worn by a person has great potential in effective and unobtrusive long term monitoring and recognition of ADLs. This paper presents an effective and unobtrusive activity recognition system based on the combination of the data from two different types of sensors: RFID tag readers and accelerometers. We evaluate our algorithms on non-scripted datasets of 10 housekeeping activities performed by 12 subjects. The experimental results show that recognition accuracy can be significantly improved by fusing the two different types of sensors. We analyze different acceleration features and algorithms, and based on tag detections we suggest the best tagspsila placements and the key objects to be tagged for each activity.},

Much useful information, fall detection, fall risk assessment, activity recognition, early illness detection, etc. can be inferred from the mountain of data. Healthcare must be human centric and human friendly, and so, methods to consolidate the data into linguistic summaries for enhanced communication and problem detection with elders, family and healthcare providers is essential. Long term trends can be most easily identified using summarized information.

pages={6161-6165}, 
abstract={Advances in Information and Communication Technologies, ICT, are bringing new opportunities and use cases in the field of systems and Personal Health Devices used for the telemonitoring of citizens in Home or Mobile scenarios. At a time of such challenges, this review arises from the need to identify robust technical telemonitoring solutions that are both open and interoperable. These systems demand standardized solutions to be cost effective and to take advantage of standardized operation and interoperability. Thus, the fundamental challenge is to design plug-&-play devices that, either as individual elements or as components, can be incorporated in a simple way into different Telecare systems, perhaps configuring a personal user network. Moreover, there is an increasing market pressure from companies not traditionally involved in medical markets, asking for a standard for Personal Health Devices, which foresee a vast demand for telemonitoring, wellness, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and e- health applications. However, the newly emerging situations imply very strict requirements for the protocols involved in the communication. The ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards is adapting and moving in order to face the challenge and might appear the best positioned international standards to reach this goal. This work presents an updated survey of these standards, trying to track the changes that are being fulfilled, and tries to serve as a starting-point for those who want to familiarize themselves with them.},

abstract={Through an integration of wireless communication and sensing technologies, the concept of a body sensor network (BSN) was initially proposed in the early decade with the aim to provide an essential technology for wearable, ambulatory, and pervasive health monitoring for elderly people and chronic patients. It has become a hot research area due to big opportunities as well as great challenges it presents. Though the idea of an implantable BSN was proposed in parallel with the on-body sensor network, the development in this area is relatively slow due to the complexity of human body, safety concerns, and some technological bottlenecks such as the design of ultralow-power implantable RF transceiver. This paper describes a new wireless implantable BSN that operates in medical implant communication service (MICS) frequency band. This system innovatively incorporates both sensing and actuation nodes to form a closed-control loop for physiological monitoring and drug delivery for critically ill patients. The sensing node, which is designed using system-on-chip technologies, takes advantage of the newly available ultralow-power Zarlink MICS transceiver for wireless data transmission. Finally, the specific absorption rate distribution of the proposed system was simulated to determine the in vivo electromagnetic field absorption and the power safety limits.},

abstract={Technology for care at home is an important factor in supporting our ageing population. These technologies need to be both accessible and acceptable to a wide variety of users if they are to be taken up and successfully used in people's homes. This paper describes the user-centered co-design and evaluation of a multimodal reminder system for the home deployed on mobile devices. Six co-design sessions (N=25 users) were carried out with groups of older users to investigate the best methods and techniques for configuring reminders and how they should be delivered within the home. Both sketches and implemented prototypes were used to gather qualitative feedback on a variety of interaction features and techniques to find what worked best for an older user group. We present the findings from the sessions in terms of the re-design of a personalisable multimodal reminder system. We also present the co-design process used and go on to discuss the value this method adds to the design and evaluation of home care technologies for older users.},

From a case study that we conducted with six (6) participants we gained an initial understanding of how the elderly manage their medications to avoid the inherent risks associated with medicating that are identified in the literature. From this understanding, we identified how the characteristics for notification systems should be implemented in a system with the goal of supporting an activity carried out by older adults. Thus, we present the design characteristics incorporated into the wearable notification display for medication adherence, which we consider will enable the elderly to easily read and interpret the information presented on the display.},

Beds with such functionalities represent a tangible alternative to expensive and obtrusive routines for sleep assessment, such as polysomnography.

abstract={With the world population aging rapidly, improving the quality of life for senior citizens has become an important societal issue. Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most debilitating neuro-degenerative disorders that seriously affect the seniors' quality of life. In recent years, video games have been shown to be a viable way through which partial rehabilitation for PD can be carried out in a fun and low cost manner. Earlier research has shown that both patients' physical and mental conditions can be improved by playing video games. However, so far, the available games developed for PD are mostly intended for rehabilitation purposes. PD diagnosis still depends on the traditional neurological exams and experience of doctors, which require the patients to become self-aware of the symptoms and are usually too late for the patients to delay the progression of PD. To support the early detection of PD symptoms, we propose a fuzzy logic based PD risk predictor that has been implemented in a tablet game platform. The player's behavior data in the game environment are captured unobtrusively and analyzed in real-time. The player's current risk of developing PD is estimated using the proposed fuzzy logic based approach, which will help the player to be aware of high risk of having PD at an earlier stage. A pilot evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Decrease of Dual-Task (DT) ability is known to be one of fall-risk factors. We developed a new game concept, Dual-Task Tai Chi (DTTC), using Kinect (Microsoft Co.), a motion-capture device, and demonstrated that the DTTC test can quantitatively evaluate various functions that are known risk factors for falling in elderly adults. Moreover, DT training has been attracting attention as a way to improve balance and DT ability. However, only a few studies have reported that it improves cognitive performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether or not a 12-week program of DTTC training would effectively improve cognitive functions. A total of 41 elderly individuals (training group: n = 26, control group: n = 15) participated in this study and their cognitive functions were assessed before and after DTTC training. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with significant group x time interactions for the executive cognitive function measure: t:. trail-making test (part Bpart A) (p <; 0.05). The results suggest that DTTC training is effective for improving executive cognitive functions.},

year={2010}, 
pages={1-4}, 
abstract={After the ten years rise of ageing population in Taiwan, it has increased the population rate of elders to nearly 10% in year 2009. Since 1990, the day-time aged care service has been implemented over decades in Taiwan. The social welfare has been attended and been actively promoted among the communities with the aged day-care service (ADCS) in recent years. The successful implementation of the ADCS relies on the overwhelming supports from all stakeholders, i.e. instructors, their related families, directors of the organizations and leaders of local communities, but also to understand the emotional needs of elders, ethical care, responses to the self-esteem issues and practical care support exercises by the experienced aged carers. Since the ADCS must deliver relaxed and positive environments for groups of instructors and elders to interact with each other in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment. Thus, the elder's needs must be known in prior of attending the ADCS which could continually improve the aged care service quality. This initial study aims to investigate the context of use of a Web-based prognostics scoring system among stakeholders in order to create a working prototype that provides useful information regarding elder's emotional needs. The system will create a Web-based community among stakeholders in order to actively provide emotion status of specific elders to instructor, which allows instructor to give a special care to specific elders in the assigned ADCS. The prognostics scoring information can be gained based on the elders' attendance rate, positive attitude toward the day-cared treatment, the objective performance of the exercises, and subjective assessment of the emotion scale, which is feed by both instructors, their related family and associated aged carers. It hopes that the design approach and the system and associated products could support a self-sustaining ADCS by the village community itself. Further recommendation will be made.},

abstract={Body sensor networks (BSN) can capture physical phenomena from a human body, contextual information from the environment and high level events of a person. Associating contextual information and events with the captured raw sensory data can serve as a crucial input for many applications such as e-health. For example, to accurately and timely monitor an elderly person with several physical disabilities while he is at home or outdoors, the context and event information along with raw sensory data needs to be reached to an e-health service provider to assist in taking time critical decision. Such process includes receiving the sensory data, analyzing it to trigger necessary services such as sending an alert message to the family physician, hospital, emergency service, his immediate caregiver, family members, friends and so on. A BSN also allows members of one's community of interest, referred to as a social network, to query real-time sensory, contextual and event data. Combining the social network with BSN is envisioned to enhance the current state of the art in e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a framework, called SenseFace, that can dynamically pass sensory data from one's BSN to his/her social network and vice versa. Finally, we illustrate the design and implementation of the framework.},

abstract={Gait velocity has been shown to quantitatively estimate risk of future hospitalization, a predictor of disability, and has been shown to slow prior to cognitive decline. In this paper, we describe a system for continuous and unobtrusive in-home assessment of gait velocity, a critical metric of function. This system is based on estimating walking speed from noisy time and location data collected by a ??sensor line?? of restricted view passive infrared motion detectors. We demonstrate the validity of our system by comparing with measurements from the commercially available GAITRite walkway system gait mat. We present the data from 882 walks from 27 subjects walking at three different subject-paced speeds (encouraged to walk slowly, normal speed, or fast) in two directions through a sensor line. The experimental results show that the uncalibrated system accuracy (average error) of estimated velocity was 7.1 cm/s (SD = 11.3 cm/s), which improved to 1.1 cm/s (SD = 9.1 cm/s) after a simple calibration procedure. Based on the average measured walking speed of 102 cm/s, our system had an average error of less than 7% without calibration and 1.1% with calibration.},

This paper presents an universal approach to designing of multimodal health monitoring systems with regard to a paradigm of ubiquitous and personalized medicine. The design combines advantages of intelligent reprogrammable sensors, flexibility of reconfigurable networks built on human body area or embedded in building infrastructures and automatic, person-dependent decision making based on presumptions and experience represented in artificial intelligence. Considering these key features leads to a system design suitable for majority of human surveillance purposes including home care, hospices, rehabilitation and sport training. The paper also presents a prototype system designed accordingly to proposed rules and tested in some experimental setups intended to simulate volunteers' homes. The results confirm that the system adapts to environment-specific relations, provides seamless monitoring with no limit of indoor and outdoor mobility and adapts to subject's habits in recognition of normal, suspected and dangerous events.},

abstract={Social networks connect people while internet of things platforms connect things. Although both platforms use various communication tools in efficient ways, platforms for things often don't communicate and interoperate with social networks. As a consequence, there is a lack of unified programming interfaces and platforms to enable internet-based interactions between people and things. This hinders deployment of services where people and things need to co-exist such as in ambient assisted living and collaborative sensing scenarios. We propose activity feeds as a unified communication framework to address this integration challenge. The activity feed concept is widely deployed in social networks and recently also in internet of things platforms. It is a flexible and easy-to-understand concept. We propose a communication framework based on activity feeds consisting of a set of concepts, a set of patterns for using activity feeds, an API for developing applications, and a reference implementation of the framework on smart phones. We describe how we tested this framework in two different applications in the areas of ambient assisted living and crisis management. For these two applications we were able to easily deploy the framework by invoking the activity feed API. We report on how we use communication patterns based on activity feeds and how the framework managed to facilitate people and thing communication.},

abstract={In less than 25 years, 37 million people are expected to have dementia and/or Alzheimerpsilas disease. This significant figure is a result of several factors, including increasing life expectancy and an ageing population in developing countries. Alzheimerpsilas disease, a form of dementia, is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory loss, and behavior and personality changes. People suffering from this disease become increasingly physically and cognitively impaired; they usually need help with all aspects of daily living. While there is currently no cure for dementia, special therapies (e.g., arts and crafts, music therapy) can help people with dementia to live as good a life as possible. We propose to use socially assistive robots as customized/individualized helpers as a complement to humans. This work proposes a new adaptive socially assistive robotic (SAR) system that aims to provide a customized protocol through motivation, encouragement, and companionship for users suffering from cognitive changes related to aging and/or Alzheimerpsilas disease. The robot aims to maintain/improve the userpsilas cognitive attention in a cognitive music game setup.},

abstract={The Western welfare model is under pressure and finding new ways of providing care is a key issue to maintain a reasonable service level for elderly people spending their last years at a nursing home. Personal care at nursing homes tends to (quite reasonably) have high priority at the expense of social activities, thus creating situations where a number of elderly people experience loneliness. This paper presents ongoing work that focuses on developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for nursing homes that brings together professional care activities and family initiated care. We discuss challenges and opportunities for welfare or assistive technology design to support articulation work in a care setting, where both care professionals and family members (of the elderly inhabitants) co-exists. Furthermore, the care sector at hand suffers from economical limitations that challenge a successful implementation of more costly technologies. We present a concept named Care to Share? that seeks to bring together professional and family initiated care and that assists in the articulation work of social activities in a nursing home.},

abstract={As the world's elderly population significantly increases, researchers are searching for ways to slow and prevent age-related diseases such as dementia. Currently, a growing body of research supports the effectiveness of using non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the decline of or improve brain functioning in people suffering from dementia. However, implementing and sustaining such interventions on a long-term basis is difficult as they require considerable resources and people, and can be very time-consuming for healthcare staff. Our research focuses on making these interventions more accessible to healthcare professionals through the aid of robotic assistants while validating their effectiveness. The objective of our work is to develop intelligent socially assistive robots as therapeutic aids designed to maintain, and even improve, the residual social and cognitive functioning in persons with dementia. In this paper, we study the social interaction attributes of our human-like socially assistive robot, Brian 2.0, during a person-centered cognitively stimulating activity to determine if the robot is able to engage a person in the activity by providing task assistance, encouragement, reinforcement, and celebration. Our preliminary proof-of-concept results show that the social interaction capabilities of Brian 2.0 are effective in engaging individuals in a cognitively stimulating game.},

pages={522-525}, 
abstract={Pervasive computing technologies can benefit the injured, disabled or elderly people in their daily lives, and smart wheelchair has been a representative of this kind of technologies. However, most existing smart wheelchairs have limitations on extensibility and flexibility of building new functionalities. One big reason is they are just stand-alone ones considering other wheelchairs and surrounding things as dummy objects. To address this issue, we proposed an integrated and collaborative approach: Smarter Wheelchairs that can “talk” to each other, and even “talk” to other things in the surrounding. Smarter Wheelchairs take advantages of smart objects deployed in living environment or hospital environment. Smarter Wheelchairs can harness functions provided by smart objects, therefore, their functionality can be flexibly extended. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype system of Smarter Wheelchairs to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract={In this paper we investigate the precise focus required of a telemonitoring system for the domain of independently living elderly. Particularly, we investigate (1) the needs of telemonitoring for this particular domain, and (2) the requirements for such a telemonitoring system. For our investigation, we performed an extensive study of the literature, as well as performed interviews with 36 individuals active in the field. As a result, we established numerous needs to be considered, being foremost information need on safety, with regard to care response on emergencies (e.g., falling incidents, wandering), as well information need on dependence on care, with regard to inactivity, self-neglect and loneliness. Subsequently, we established numerous requirements to be addressed, being foremost the use of non-wearable sensors, unobtrusiveness, durability, reliability, privacy, and ubiquitousness. In our discussion of the requirements, we detailed specifically the topics of focus, functionality, and form of a telemonitoring system for this domain.},

abstract={The growing evolution in the development of embedded systems has raised a numerous amount of distributed applications. Such applications have a strong tendency to integrate various types of existing devices. This trend is aligned with the ideas of ubiquitous computing, which is expected to turn devices increasingly independent of people, making the relationship between technologies more natural and intuitive. The different communication rotocols used by these devices target a specific segment, such as multimedia sharing, electronic security, home automation and healthcare. However, this variety increases the complexity of device integration and represents an obstacle to their development. This paper presents an architecture capable of providing compatible services that can be requested using heterogeneous protocols and is based on the fundamentals of the service-oriented architecture. The central component of this architecture is a middleware capable of abstracting requests of different protocols, facilitating dynamic composition of services distributed in heterogeneous LAN. The proposed architecture is detailed in this article. In addition, several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed middleware, in pursuit of their boundaries and aiming to validate the adopted technologies. As far as we know, our work is the first one that provides interoperation between the DLNA and DPWS technologies.},

abstract={With more and more elders in most countries, the health and safety issues become the primary concern for elderly people because ageing is often associated with physical and cognitive impairments. In order to provide intelligent assistive services for elders, in this paper, we propose an integrated service platform that can accommodate safety assurance, daily activity assistance, and health support services. Specifically, the platform takes care of anomalous events detection, daily activities tracking, and health status monitoring leveraging stationary sensors deployed in living environments and mobile sensing artifacts carried by elders. The services in this integrated platform can ensure safety and independency of elders, they can also help them sustain and/or improve health condition with personalized health support. Based on the proposed platform, we present a case study of assistive safety assurance service wandering detection, which monitors an elder's outdoor movements by using GPS sensor embedded in smart phone and recognizes the lapping or pacing movement pattern to find potential wandering behavior. The experimental results show that our method works well in detecting wandering behavior in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of an intelligent walking aid for the frail and elderly as well as for patients who are recovering from surgical procedures, in order to enhance safer mobility for these study populations. The device augments a conventional rolling walker aid with sensing and navigational abilities to safely travel through an environment following user's perceived intentions, unless collisions or instability is imminent. The agent, embodied as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), critically relies on minimal user input to seamlessly recognise user's short-term intended behaviour, constantly updating this projection to allow for inconspicuous user-robot integration. This, in turn, shifts user's focus from fine motor-skilled control to coarse indications broadly intended to convey intention. Overall, the system can afford an increase in safety for the cognitive user through preventative care - reduced number of falls or collision with surrounding objects, minimising health-care expenses as well as increasing independent living for people with gait disorders. Successful simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed architecture for a practical robotic rollator design.},

It is shown how they can be used and that either of them has its own advantages and drawbacks in terms of short- and long-term analyses.

abstract={Deep design outlined in the paper is a new approach, where not only tasks, immediate emotions or habits and behaviours are considered. Deep design aims to identify sources of emotionally rich and strong experiences and feelings in order to augment them subsequently by means of smart technology. The most intrinsical needs of users, their deep needs, should be revealed and reflected in the process. Evaluation of a new technology is described as a successive process, starting with immediate decision, followed by short-term acceptance and finally long-term appropriation driven by the deep needs in a role of high order reinforcers. Deep design builds on various existing human-centric and emotion-driven approaches, but brings them further, or maybe rather deeper, bringing deep psycho-technical and socio-technical factors on the highest levels of importance. The idea of deep design is being introduced in a context of ambient technologies for elderlies, because actually there are certain dissonances in what do elderlies need and what many current intelligent technologies offer. As we show in the paper, our research in sources ranging from gerontology to ambient intelligence revealed four clusters of deep needs of elderlies-social touch, autonomy with anticipated support, feeling of being competent and feeling of helpfulness and self-worth.},

abstract={The number of seniors and other people needing daily assistance continues to increase, but the current human resources available to achieve this in the coming years will certainly be insufficient. To remedy this situation, smart habitats have emerged as an innovative avenue for supporting needs of daily assistance. Smart homes aim to provide cognitive assistance in decision making by giving hints, suggestions, and reminders, with different kinds of effectors, to residents. To implement such technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of ongoing activity. Some researchers have proposed solutions based on binary sensors or cameras, but these types of approaches infringed on residents' privacy. A new affordable activity-recognition system based on passive RFID technology can detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The entire system relies on an innovative model of elliptical trilateration with several filters, as well as on an ingenious representation of activities with spatial zones. The authors have deployed the system in a real smart-home prototype; this article renders the results of a complete set of experiments conducted on this new activity-recognition system with real scenarios.},

abstract={Falls are a major health risk that diminish the quality of life among elderly people. Apart from falls themselves, most dramatic consequences are usually related with long lying periods that can cause serious side effects. These findings call for pervasive long-term fall detection systems able to automatically detect falls. In this paper, we propose an effective fall detection algorithm for mobile platforms. Using data retrieved from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs) and/or SmartPhones (SPs), our algorithm is able to detect falls using features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope. While mostly of the mobile-based solutions for fall management deal only with accelerometer data, in the proposed approach we combine the instantaneous acceleration magnitude vector with changes of the user's heading in a Threshold Based Algorithm (TBA). In such a way, we were able to handle falls detection with minimal computational load, increasing the overall system accuracy with respect to traditional fall management methods. Experimental results show the strong detection performance of the proposed solution in discriminating between falls and typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) presenting fall-like acceleration patterns.},

abstract={A novel approach to performing unsupervised mobility assessment tests in domestic environments is presented. As a part of the aTUG concept the approach is based on the idea to segment assessment tests into components made up of recurring movement patterns which are measured independently by use of ambient sensor technologies. Quality criteria are defined which compute a score of eligibility for usage of sensor data to assess a certain test component. Valid component measurements are recombined to complete assessment tests according to a technical assessment test description defining the flow of segments and their constraints. An experiment has been conducted within a field trial with five elderly people aged 64-84 years over five weeks. The flats of all people were equipped with home automation (HA) sensors. A laser range scanner (LRS) was placed in one flat. Results from the fully-equipped flat show that the presented quality criteria are suitable to select LRS measurements according to their eligibility to assess a certain component. HA sensors and the LRS were used to compute a self-selected gait velocity of 0.71m/s unsupervised at home. TUG using the aTUG apparatus and a stopwatch was used as clinical reference data yielding a mean gait velocity of 1.18m/s. For the described setting a difference of 0.47m/s between capacity and performance in gait velocity was found.},

It collects the information necessary for living state estimation by using sensors placed in the recipient house and informs the dosing condition of the recipient to caretakers thought a server computer. By using iMec, they can check the dosing condition anytime, anywhere. And, they can also receive e-mail immediately when iMec detects signs of incorrect dosing. We confirmed that iMec was able to estimate the present living state related to common dosing timings by experiments.},

abstract={This paper describes the results of a research conducted in the European project Accompany, whose aim is to provide older people with services in a motivating and socially acceptable manner to facilitate independent living at home. The project developed a system consisting of a robotic companion, Care-O-bot, as part of a smart environment. An intensive research was conducted to investigate and experiment with robot behaviours that trigger empathic exchanges between an older person and the robot. The paper is articulated in two parts. The first part illustrates the theory that inspired the development of a context-aware Graphical User Interface (GUI) used to interact with the robot. The GUI integrates an expressive mask allowing perspective taking with the aim to stimulate empathic exchanges. The second part focuses on the user evaluation, and reports the outcomes from three different tests. The results of the first two tests show a positive acceptance of the GUI by the older people. The final test reports qualitative comments by senior participants on the occurrence of empathic exchanges with the robot.},

abstract={The paper describes a real-time adaptive battery modelling methodology for use in an all electric personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicle. Through use of a sliding-mode observer and online subspace parameter estimation, the voltages associated with monitoring the state of charge (SoC) of the battery system are shown to be accurately estimated, even with erroneous initial conditions in both the model and parameters. In this way, problems such as self- discharge during storage of the cells and SoC drift (as usually incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to overcharging or ambient temperature fluctuations) are overcome. Moreover, through online monitoring of the degradation of the estimated parameters, battery ageing (State of Health) can be monitored and, in the case of safety- critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Due to the adaptive nature of the proposed methodology, this system can be implemented over a wide range of operating environments, applications and battery topologies, by adjustment of the underlying state-space model.},

abstract={We've long heard about the wide functionality that home automation technologies offer for improving our lives and securing our houses. However, price and an unstable domotics market have restricted such systems' deployment. Nowadays, companies offer too technology-dependent solutions that don't cover user demands completely. Meanwhile, research works focus on small innovations on specific parts of home automation systems, which don't consider integration and deployment issues to present practical designs. The system presented in this article considers user requirements, including novel advances, all in an integral home automation solution suitable for many services. The architecture's modular nature allows direct adaptation to specific cases using standard domotic technologies, for managing in-house devices, and a proposal of an IP-based network for connecting the main home automation module with other platform elements. A remote security system has been developed, and managing tasks are enabled via in-home control panels and an advanced 3D application for local and remote homeowner access. The system has been deployed on a prototype house, testing a wide set of domotic services. Moreover, the range of indoor pervasive applications has also been extended to e-health, elderly adaptation, greenhouse automation, and energy efficiency.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Nowadays many users can be involved willingly and monitored in a more or less intrusive manner with data collected in their homes. This data can be collected from mobile and wearable devices (such as smart phone and smart watch), from sensors disseminated in the home (such as motion detectors and contact switches) and from self-reported information systems (using paper based or web-based ecological momentary assessment techniques). This data can then be useful to characterize the activity, the health and the well-being of the involved person. Enabling people suffering (such as elderly people, people with physical disabilities and people with mental-health condition) to stay in their home as long as possible in good condition is an important challenge for many countries. Firstly, most of people would rather to continue to live in their own home rather than move to a nursing-home or an hospital, secondly the solutions enabling staying at home are also usually cheaper for the society. As a consequence Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) systems gain more and more attention. SHAAL systems use information and communication technologies in a person's daily living environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected and live independently. SHAAL's research covers a wide range of topics. This talk will review the main aspects of SHAAL systems from the data mining point of view. Several case studies will be illustrated. In particular it will emphasize the key role of activity learning and behavior understanding.},

abstract={Supporting healthy ageing through sustained physical fitness requires interventions that promote healthy levels of physical activity as part of daily life. Wearable devices, such as activity trackers are body-worn and may be seamlessly integrated into daily activities to promote fitness. Although wearables have been used by younger adopters to optimise physical fitness, little is known so far how these emerging technologies may be leveraged to enhance learning and improve well-being and fitness of seniors. In this paper we present a novel approach to designing Wearable Enhanced Learning (WELL) for healthy ageing as part of the R&D project “Fitness MOOC - interaction of seniors with wearable fitness trackers in the MOOC (fMOOC)”. The fMOOC project is a cooperation between Beuth University of Applied Sciences and the Geriatrics Research Group at Charité Berlin and aims at enhancing healthy ageing through an embodied learning experience in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with support of wearable activity trackers. This paper focuses on gamification designs in wearable enhanced learning for senior users and addresses the issue of user engagement.},

And then the architecture of the context-aware system is defined. The lifecycle of such system includes two phase, namely design phase and running phase. In service design phase, the development model can describe user's context, situation, and services' configuration information. While in running phase, the execution engine can build the instances of a model and navigating the execution of the model, namely, receive the context changing events, manage the user's Scene transitions and invoke the context-aware services according to the scene's configuration. In addition the model is exemplified with an elder health monitoring model.},

abstract={In this paper, we present and discuss the evaluation of end user acceptance of a wrist device, designed to monitor vital signs and to detect adverse situations, such as falls, unconsciousness etc. and, if necessary, to alert emergency services to the wearers need. The goals of all concerned must be taken into account if the technological advances are to be of benefit to those for whom they are being designed. After the technical assessment was made, a further study of the end users views was aimed to show the acceptance levels of elderly end users to the idea of personal monitoring, its perceived usefulness in their every day lives, and their judgment of the design. This was made in the form of a questionnaire divided into five main areas: usefulness, attractiveness, usability, comfort and acceptance, and each end user was interviewed regarding their goals. Each of the interviewees regarded their own continuing independence as a primary goal; however their views as to the possibility of achieving this goal by the use of advanced technology differed. This work was completed as part of the EMERGE project, aimed at the support of elderly people in everyday life using innovative monitoring and assistance systems, with the use of ambient and unobtrusive sensors in order to increase their safety, thereby promoting a longer period of independence, a step made necessary by the demographic increase in the elderly population in Europe.},

pages={28-33}, 
abstract={Technology advances and the continuing convergence of computing and telecommunications have made an unprecedented amount of information available to the public. For many people with disabilities, however, accessibility issues limit the impact of such widespread availability. Of the many types of disabilities-mobility, hearing, and learning impairments, for example-vision impairments are most pervasive in the general population, especially among seniors. The world's rapidly aging population is redefining visually impaired, which refers to individuals with low vision (that is, people for whom ordinary eyeglasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lens implants don't provide clear vision), color blindness, and blindness. In 1998, the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act, strengthening provisions covering access to government-posted information for people with disabilities. As amended, Section 508 requires federal agencies to ensure that all assets and technologies are accessible and usable by employees and the public, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Most current assistive technologies for visually impaired users are expensive, difficult to use, and platform dependent. A new approach by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), addresses these weaknesses by locating the assistive capability at the server, thus freeing visually impaired individuals from the software expense, technical complexity, and substantial learning curve of other assistive technologies. NLM's Senior Health Web site (http://nihseniorhealth.gov), a talking Web (a Web application that presents Web content as speech to users), demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.},

abstract={Health-related aspects are very important to both civilian and each of the countries. Three key issues have been currently realized. Firstly, Deficiency of medical personnel affects the quality of treatment, care and nursing. Secondly, many countries have been approaching a super-aged society. Proper policies are needed and applied to the elderly. Thirdly, current medical system lacks of preventive medicine application which efficiently prevents and relieves disease prevalence. Computer technology has been currently applied to several domains in order to yield better performance. Wearable devices have become usable and applicable to sense several vital signs and communicate them with other networked nodes via the Internet. In this paper, "UbiNurSS on Mobile - A Ubiquitous Nursing Support System on Mobile Devices" has been developed for nursing support. UbiNurSS employs available devices which are capable of measuring pulse which reflects pulse or heart rate and blood pressure. Mobile devices have also been used. UbiNurSS on Mobile consists of two sub-systems -- a mobile application which facilitates health monitoring and warning for both wearer and doctor, and a web application which facilitates the nurse's or caregiver's tasks at a nursing station or an ordinary dwelling. The heart rate report and corresponding warning can be generated in real-time. We demonstrate feasible applicability of UbiNurSS on Mobile in terms of users' satisfaction survey.},

The intelligent pharmaceutical packaging is sealed by the Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by wireless communication. Various vital parameters can also be collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the wireless link. On-site diagnosis and prognosis of these vital parameters are supported by the high performance architecture. Additionally, friendly user interface is emphasized to ease the operation for the elderly, disabled, and patients.

abstract={Our society will face a notable demographic shift in the near future. According to a United Nations report, the ratio of the elderly population (aged 60 years or older) to the overall population increased from 9.2% in 1990 to 11.7% in 2013 and is expected to reach 21.1% by 2050 [1]. According to the same report, 40% of older people live independently in their own homes. This ratio is about 75% in the developed countries. These facts will result in many societal challenges as well as changes in the health-care system, such as an increase in diseases and health-care costs, a shortage of caregivers, and a rise in the number of individuals unable to live independently [2]. Thus, it is imperative to develop ambient intelligence-based assisted living (AL) tools that help elderly people live independently in their homes. The recent developments in sensor technology and decreasing sensor costs have made the deployment of various sensors in various combinations viable, including static setups as well as wearable sensors. This article presents a survey that concentrates on the signal processing methods employed with different types of sensors. The types of sensors covered are pyro-electric infrared (PIR) and vibration sensors, accelerometers, cameras, depth sensors, and microphones.},

abstract={Japan, along with many developed countries, is facing severe social problems caused by a declining birth rate. Gradual shrinkage of the working population has brought shortages of workers performing various services such as elderly care. Women are potential workers, but social assistance of working women remains insufficient. Social services such as elderly care and support for working women must be developed to address these problems. The infrastructure for future ubiquitous services must be designed as a service platform to provide those services respecting individual personal circumstances and at socially acceptable cost. Ubiquitous services provide enhanced mobility. Future ubiquitous services will evolve toward enhanced pervasiveness, and will be defined as advanced personalized services. This report presents a new concept, Socio-familiar Personalized Service (S-P Service), for future ubiquitous services based on sociality and humanity. Moreover, we propose a scalable distributed authentication method to realize S-P Service.},

abstract={Orange Technology, a concept that originated in Taiwan, sets the goal to bring more happiness and promote mental wellness for the elderly. This study adopted a virtual orchid planting game symbolizing Orange Technology for a case study through explorative panel discussion followed by focus group interviews which separately included elderly and middle-aged people. This study aimed to find key factors influencing the development of Orange Technology Game (OTG) by introducing technology acceptance model (TAM) analysis. The results show that providing more recreational experiences (RE) and enhancing game induced self-efficacy (GISE) are two key factors, in which, memory improvement, social contact and self-learning are identified for RE, and perceived enjoyment, emotional stability and knowledge exchange are identified for GISE. Moreover, a hypothesis for seniors' TAM is proposed as that GISE will mediate RE to influence seniors' happiness & mental wellness along three identified dimensions of “mental health care”, “social relationships” and “leisure satisfaction”. In addition, middle-aged people showed more enthusiasm than elderly people for each dimension, such that Orange Technology game should shed light on these key factors to fulfill the needs of elder care.},

abstract={In monitoring a patient's real-time vital signs through Body Area Networks (BAN), rich data sources are communicated to medical practitioners. The benefit of BANs may be negated if medical practitioners are overloaded with streams of BAN data. It is essential that data is delivered in a timely context aware manner. In this paper a BAN designed for falls assessment among elder patients (65+ years) is presented, with an emphasis on the communication scheme chosen. The FrameComm MAC protocol described in this paper employs three data management techniques, 1) message priority, 2) opportunistic aggregation and 3) an adaptive duty cycle, all of which are designed to ensure that patient vital signs (i.e. data packets) are delivered under a variety of network loads. The protocol is evaluated using a small laboratory network, initially configured to communicate Beat-to-Beat (continuous blood pressure) readings when a patient goes from a sitting to a standing position and then with added ECG (ElectroCardioGram) readings.},

abstract={Aware homes support the monitoring of older adults, with the potential to detect a wealth of information regarding the person's functional, cognitive and social wellbeing. While much research in this space focuses on the collection and interpretation of sensor data, it is equally important to understand how we can begin to relay the information learned back to older adults, empowering them to play an active role in the management of their health. In this paper we discuss the results of the requirements gathering phase of our research with a number of older adults living in aware homes. The goal of this research is to explore issues surrounding the delivery of healthcare information, as collected through embedded sensors in the home, to the home owner. Our results reveal a number of emerging themes around this space, including a desire by older adults to play an active role in managing their health and potential concerns surrounding the delivery of such information through technology.},

abstract={Assisting elderly people in emergency situations is very important to improve their quality of life. This assistance can be done with the help of volunteers using technology and in particular pervasive and mobile computing. We propose in this paper Assist-Me, a smart system aimed at assisting elderly people in case of emergency. The goal is to enhance elderly people daily life independence and autonomy, in indoor and outdoor environments, by offering flexible and faster assistance in emergency situations via social intervention offered by volunteers. We believe that our solution can alleviate the unnecessary intervention of emergency center, provide a flexible volunteering intervention and better serve elderly people in needs. Assist-Me includes two smartphone applications: one for elderly people that require emergency assistance and the second for volunteers who receive the request. Assist-Me manages emergency situations by automatically selecting appropriate volunteers based on fuzzy-logic engine. The implementation of the engine is also presented in this paper.},

abstract={Taking the technology advances of bio-monitoring sensor, wireless sensor network (WSN), pervasive Internet and prevalent smartphone, we design a ubiquitous personal health surveillance and management system called UPHSM. Our system cost-effectively integrates health-related sensory devices with the application-layer gateway (ALG) implemented on an open-source smartphone (i.e. Google Android phone). It can aid senior citizens and patients who need long-term attention to their illness, like chronic diseases, with ubiquitous surveillance and remote management of the recorded health data. The proposed smartphone ALG (SmartALG) between WSN and Internet can multiplex different health/environment sensory data in both reliability and security. Through the smartphone's Internet connection over 2.5G/3.5G/WiFi, SmartALG delivers the multiplexed sensory data with user's location to remote server to enable the ubiquitous health surveillance and management. Not only the medical expertise can remotely browse the stored sensory data for diagnosing, but also, while the remote sever detects abnormality in sensory data, a short message with concise information will be immediately sent to user's relatives and healthcare professionals to provide proper treatment for personalized and timely care.},

abstract={The aging population is in demand of new tools for better quality of life. Technology has this power. Aim: This study aimed to assess the impact of using Nintendo Wii® in the elderly. Methods: The impact in balance was measured using Berg scale, the activities of daily living using Barthel, cognitive status using MMSe and perceived health status using SF-36. A sample of 65 seniors from a nursing home was randomly allocated to 3 groups: Wii with the supervision of a Physiotherapist (Group A; n=23), Wii without supervision (Group B; n=20), and just Geriatric Gymnastics (Group C; n=22) during 20 sessions. Results: Better attendance and satisfaction were obtained in Group A. In physical terms significant better results were found in SF 36 on Group A and in Berg score of Group C. In mental assessment, a significant worse result was obtained in SF36 of Group A. Also significantly better results in Vitality and Mental Health of Group B were obtained. In therapy exposure, there were significantly better results in group A of the SF36 in individuals with more than 750 minutes (15 sessions). There were no accidents and/or injury registered during the sessions. Conclusion: The supervised use of the Wii, improves the physical component of the elderly and it also can be a motivating factor for exercise practice. This activity can bring better perception of the vitality of the elderly and physical functioning. In other aspects it may also have a depressive effect on some participants. This study highlights the importance of expert supervision when using a Wii as a therapeutic instrument in a senior population.},

This paper describes our design and implementation a reminiscence therapy game on Android tablet for Chinese seniors to help them maintain their memory capacities as well as their calculating abilities. To be more effective as a method of reminiscence therapy, we choose government food stamps that were mandated in China from 1960s to 1980s, as the backdrop of our game.

abstract={With ubiquitous Internet accessibility, audio-video-based remote-patient monitoring is becoming a viable option for people who are responsible for providing in-home healthcare management. In Japan's rapidly aging society, many elderly patients who have lost mobility, speech, or memory live with their families. Although they do not necessarily need intense medical care, these patients require constant attention to ensure their safety. Broadband audio and video introduce a novel possibility for applying remote-monitoring technology to home healthcare. For example, various MPEG compression technologies can transmit high-quality audio-video via the Internet so that a family member can use an office PC or wireless mobile terminal to monitor a bedridden patient's image and vital signs while a caregiver runs errands. Using live audio and video streaming in this manner, however, raises privacy concerns. Transmitting unprotected audio-visual signals, compressed in a standard format, over the Internet carries the risk that someone can monitor these transmissions, whether accidentally or intentionally},

title={Improving the sensitivity of unobtrusive inactivity detection in sensor-enabled homes for the elderly}, 
year={2016}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Unobtrusive in-home monitoring systems are gaining acceptability and are being deployed to enable relatives and caregivers to remotely monitor and provide timely care to their elderly loved ones or senior clients, respectively, who are living independently. Such systems can provide information about non-movement or inactivity of the elderly resident. As prolonged inactivity could mean potential danger, several algorithms have been proposed to automatically detect unusually long durations of inactivity. Such schemes, however, suffer from low sensitivity due to their high detection latency. In this paper, we propose Dwell Time-enhanced Dynamic Threshold (DTDT), a scheme for computing adaptive alert thresholds that exploit region-specific dwell time to reduce the detection latency. Using extreme value theory, we obtain a closed form expression for the per-region alert thresholds. We perform simulations using real data to evaluate the performance of DTDT and compare it with state-of-the art schemes AID and the algorithm by Moshtaghi et al. Results show that DTDT shows significantly lower detection latency, 1.5-3 hours shorter, in regions with short dwell times (bathroom and kitchen) while maintaining the same false alarm rate.},

abstract={Several researchers have proposed methods and designed systems for the automatic recognition of activities and abnormal behaviors with the goal of early detecting cognitive impairment. In this paper, we propose LOTAR, a hybrid behavioral analysis system coupling state of the art machine learning techniques with knowledge-based and data mining methods. Medical models designed in collaboration with cognitive neuroscience researchers guide the recognition of short- and long-term abnormal behaviors. In particular, we focus on historical behavior analysis for long-term anomaly detection, which is the principal novelty with respect to our previous works. We present preliminary results obtained by evaluating the method on a dataset acquired during three months of experimentation in a real patient's home.

pages={189-200}, 
abstract={Many platforms have emerged as response to the call for technology supporting active and healthy aging. Key requirements for any such e-health systems and any subsequent business exploitation are tailor-made design and proper evaluation. This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability, user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than 100 participants. The use of formal tools makes the findings comparable to other studies and forms an elderly exergaming corpus.},

abstract={Nowadays society is moving to a scenery where autonomous elderly live alone in their houses. An automatic remote monitoring system using wearable and ambient sensors is becoming even more important, and is a challenge for the future in WSNs, AAL, and Home Automation areas. Relating to this, one of the most critical events for the safety and the health of the elderly is the fall. Lot of methods, applications, and stand-alone devices have been presented so far. This work proposes a novel method based on the Support Vector Machine technique and addressed to Android low-cost smartphones. Our method starts from data acquired from accelerometer and magnetometer, now available in all the low-end devices, and uses a set of features extracted from a processing of the two signals. After an initial training, the classification of fall events and non-fall events is performed by the Support Vector Machine algorithm. Since we have decided to use the smartphone as monitoring device, the use of other invasive wearable sensors is avoided, and the user have simply to hold the phone on his pocket. Moreover, we can use the cellular network for the eventual sending of notifications and alerts to relatives in case of falls. Actually, our tests show a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.3% and a specificity of 96%.},

abstract={This paper provides an approach to evaluating Quality of Context (QoC) parameters in a ubiquitous Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment. Lack of quality can lead assisted systems to respond inappropriately, resulting in errors related to assistance or support, or putting the user at risk. QoC assessments can improve these systems and set them to perform specific actions whenever lapses in quality occur. Initially, the study presents a literature review of QoC, then it introduces the context management architecture used. The proposal is verified with the Siafu simulator in an AAL scenario where the user's health is monitored with information about blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Considering some parameters, the proposed QoC assessment allows verifying the extent to which the context information is up-to-date, valid, accurate, complete and significant. The implementation of this proposal might mean a big social impact and a technological innovation applied to AAL, at the disposal and support of a significant number of individuals such as elderly or sick people, and with a more precise technology.},

abstract={The growing number of elderly population at home and abroad necessitates improved approaches to elderly care provision. Elders, often with cognitive and physical impairment, need assistance in their activities of daily living (ADLs), which is usually provided by human caregivers (HCGs). As the demand for caregiver's assistance increases, the shortage of traditional care resources becomes obvious. In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a HCG to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons' activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt HCG depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the HCG but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregiver's acceptance, and their engagement.},

abstract={Elderly people are the most growing segment of the population. Most of the elderly people like to live an independent life at their own homes in a familiar environment. Living alone is not always safe, and often emergency situations like a fall and unconsciousness occur. We present an ambient assistant living system Altcare, based on static network video cameras. The Altcare automatically learns the common events and their location. Furthermore it detects the emergency situations happening with elderly people. In case of some emergency situations, the Altcare first confirms it with the monitored person. In case of a positive response or no response at all, the emergency situation is notified to the responsible persons, in order to get timely and effective help. Along with personal information and a short medical history of the elderly person, a patch of masked video showing the emergency event is also transmitted. The masked video on one hand maintains the privacy of the elderly people and on the other hand it helps the administrators to diagnose the problem accurately. Masked video is also helpful to provide specific initial first aid. In order to ensure timely help, the system receives acknowledgement for the sent emergency call. Some of the elderly people desire to be checked on a periodic basis. Our system gives the administrators a facility to check the state of the person at any time, which gives the elderly person a sense of safety and mental satisfaction.},

abstract={Robot companions must be able to display social, affective behaviour. As a prerequisite for companionship, the ability to sustain long-term interactions with users requires companions to be endowed with affect recognition abilities. This paper explores application-dependent user states in a naturalistic scenario where an iCat robot plays chess with children. In this scenario, the role of context is investigated for the modelling of user states related both to the task and the social interaction with the robot. Results show that contextual features related to the game and the iCat's behaviour are successful in helping to discriminate among the identified states. In particular, state and evolution of the game and display of facial expressions by the iCat proved to be the most significant: when the user is winning and improving in the game her feeling is more likely to be positive and when the iCat displays a facial expression during the game the user's level of engagement with the iCat is higher. These findings will provide the foundation for a rigorous design of an affect recognition system for a game companion.},

The main contribution is to use generalized events, described in terms of `space-time chunks', as a unifying and simplifying structuring principle. We use reasoning with ontologies and rules in combination with a database system, and also incorporate numerical computation. We show that an easy to use modeling formalism is obtained, and that reasoning is feasible at the time of service request, by using R-entailment, which enables efficient exploitation of ontologies and rules in the presence of RDF data. Two applications were built using the approach described in this paper, both of which are related to monitoring well-being of elderly people, and both of which use simple, low-cost sensors.},

title={Design of Lower Limb Chair Exercise Support System with Depth Sensor}, 
year={2014}, 
pages={104-111}, 
abstract={Sustaining lower limb functionality is extremely important in the preventative care of the elderly. Chair exercise, in which the exerciser sits on an ordinary chair, offers a way for senioars with little physical strength to exercise without a great deal of effort. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Kinect sensor that is capable of detecting human motion without the subject having to wear any kind of a special marker are becoming widely available. Exploiting this new sensor technology, this paper describes the development and deployment of a prototype lower limb chair exercise support system that takes full advantage of the Kinect depth sensor. The system supports five different chair exercises designed to strengthen the lower limbs, recognizes and evaluates exercises based on 3D position data and joint angles for each joint obtained from the Kinect sensor. The system illustrates how to do the exercises by voice instructions and model images, and superimposes the muscles used onto an image of the exerciser in real time. The system also provides exercise assessment results and advice by voice and text. In a series of trials involving seven elderly subjects in their late 70s and early 80s, an overall average recognition rate of 89% was obtained for the five exercises.},

abstract={A significant aging of world population is foreseen for the next decades. Thus, developing technologies to empower the independency and assist the elderly are becoming of great interest. In this framework, the IMMED project investigates tele-monitoring technologies to support doctors in the diagnostic and follow-up of dementia illnesses such as Alzheimer. Specifically, water sounds are very useful to track and identify abnormal behaviors form everyday activities (e.g. hygiene, household, cooking, etc.). In this work, we propose a double-stage system to detect this type of sound events. In the first stage, the audio stream is segmented with a simple but effective algorithm based on the Spectral Cover feature. The second stage improves the system precision by classifying the segmented streams into water/non-water sound events using Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients and Support Vector Machines. Experimental results reveal the potential of the combined system, yielding a F-measure higher than 80%.},

year={2015}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={According to the WHO report in 2013, the world population aging over 60 years is predicted to increase to 20 million in 2050. Aging comes about many challenges to elders due to their cognitive decline, chronic age-related diseases, as well as limitations in physical activity, vision, and hearing. Recent advances in wearable computing and mobile health technology create new opportunity for ambient assisted living system to help the person perform the activities safely and independently. The activity monitoring of daily living is the core technique of the ambient assisted living system. Several well-known approaches have utilized various sensors for activity recognition such as camera, RFID, infrared detector and inertial sensor. Since the activities are well characterized by the objects, location or hand gesture that are manipulated during their performance on activities of daily living. However, some applications included, e.g. the monitoring of specific tasks and/or movements in a rehabilitation scenario or the classification of dietary intake gestures for an automated nutrition monitoring system, where reliable activity recognition on a more fine-grained level is needed. To fulfill the requirement, we design a hierarchical window approach based on the dynamic time warping algorithm to achieve fine-grained activity recognition, where the template selection and threshold configuration is developed to cope with the ambiguity with similar features. Furthermore, a confidence estimation for the pattern matching is also proposed. The recognition procedure was successfully adapted to the investigated cleaning tasks. The overall performance in precision, recall, and F1-socre is 89.0%, 88.6%, and 88.1% respectively. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is reliable and fulfills the requirements of the ambient assisted living.},

abstract={Exercise the brain and perform physical activities slow cognitive impairment and help optimize brain functions, especially memory and thinking. This tool focuses on therapeutic aspects of both cognitive and physical stimulation of the elderly, that is, it improves the memory by performing mental activities and physical exercise at the same time. To achieve this, a Kinect based Windows application has been developed intended specifically to improve the language area of the brain function. While performing mental activities the user must resolve them by doing various physical motions. KiMentia uses skeletal tracking to capture the body movements, enabling users to control and interact with the computer without any intermediary controller. Furthermore, all the data generated during the session is stored in order to log every rehabilitation activity. Preliminary tests have shown an increase in the users' motivation while using the tool forgetting that it focuses on the cognitive stimulation. In a future research, the results from a long period study will be reported describing the cognitive performance of the patients.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the logical further development of today's Internet. Technological advancements lead to smart objects being capable of identifying, locating, sensing and connecting and thus leading to new forms of communication between people and things and things themselves. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

abstract={The aging of our society presents a range of challenges to housing providers. With the advanced mobile technologies we are now able to develop quality mobile services to help senior citizens' daily lives in dedicated smart living environments. This paper presents a systematic approach to design and develop mobile services which meet the needs of senior citizens. The quality function deployment (QFD) approach was first adopted to translate quality requirements for mobile services to technical (design) requirements for design purpose. Two most important design requirements were identified in the QFD process and they are the need for emergency service and the need for good tele healthcare provider. An architecture is then proposed to incorporate the two most important design requirements. The concept of wireless information device (WID) is integrated into the architecture to enhance service mobility, personalization and security. The pros and cons of the QFD approach as well as the architecture were discussed and future work is outlined at the end of the paper. This paper contributes to the design and development of high quality mobile services for senior citizens in smart living environments.},

The course evaluation was based on a game project. The class selected a simulation of impaired driving, and called it the Booze Cruise. Before embarking on the simulation, we consulted with the Calgary Police Service. Its alcohol unit was keen to help and gave a summary of the what and why of accident types related to alcohol consumption. Impaired driving is a serious problem and a preventable cause of death and injury. Private and public health organizations are always seeking better ways to reach the public with the message that drinking and driving is dangerous and socially irresponsible. When we announced the game in October 2007, the media response was huge (see Figure 1). The game also won the best student game and people's choice categories in the FuturePlay 2007 Conference's games competition that year (www. futureplay.org). In this article, we summarize the game's design process and development stages. We also look at media responses, which are still active.},

In our previous work, we identified the importance of the environment in the design of WBAN. Therefore, we characterize the effects of the urban environment on networking with these low power communication devices. We begin by observing the effects of some less studied factors, such as height of devices and impact of human contact on the antenna. We then present results on the characterization of two environments, namely residential housing and the university campus. Our results show that despite WiFi being omnipresent, its impact on reception probability is not significant. Thus, there is no preferred channel to operate a WBAN.},

abstract={With the rising age of the population, there is increased need to help elderly maintain their independence. Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a gentle system for watching over for ubiquitous care-support services that fulfill users' actual requirements. In traditional systems of this domain, only the location information of a user on "one" side of the watching site or the watched site is considered. In this work, we cope not only with the user's location but also all the detailed situations (contexts) of associated entities such as devices, software, networks, and users, in "both" sides. To do this, we propose a ubiquitous watching over system "uEyes". In uEyes, autonomous decision making ability and cooperative behavior are introduced to each entity. Based on the advanced feature of the entities, live video streaming system is dynamically constructed according to the contexts of the entities, on both sides in runtime. As a result, watching over service that fulfills detailed users' requirements can be effectively provided. We implemented a prototype of uEyes for watching over elderly people, and performed some experiments based on several scenarios. For instance, we assumed a scenario that a son, who is taking care of his ailing father, wanted to see his facial color and expression in high quality video. We confirmed that the live video streaming system involving high resolution camera and display devices is dynamically configured in run-time},

abstract={Gait is emerging as a powerful tool to detect early disease and monitor progression across a number of pathologies. Typically quantitative gait assessment has been limited to specialised laboratory facilities. However, measuring gait in home and community settings may provide a more accurate reflection of gait performance because: (1) it will not be confounded by attention which may be heightened during formal testing; and (2) it allows performance to be captured over time. This work addresses the feasibility and challenges of measuring gait characteristics with a single accelerometer based wearable device during free-living activity. Moreover, it describes the current methodological and statistical processes required to quantify those sensitive surrogate markers for ageing and pathology. A unified framework for large scale analysis is proposed. We present data and workflows from healthy older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD) while presenting current algorithms and scope within modern pervasive healthcare. Our findings suggested that free-living conditions heighten between group differences showing greater sensitivity to PD, and provided encouraging results to support the use of the suggested framework for large clinical application.},

abstract={Today elderly people are the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries, and they desire to live as independently as possible. But independent lifestyles come with risks and challenges. Medical in-home telemonitoring (and, more generally, telemedicine) is a solution to deal with these challenges and to ensure that elderly people can live safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible. In this context we propose an automatic in-home healthcare monitoring system for several uses and to meet the needs identified above. The proposed telemonitoring system is a multimodal platform with several sensors that can be installed at home and enables us to have a full and tightly controlled universe of data sets. It integrates elderly physiological and behavioral data, the acoustical environment of the elderly, environmental conditions and medical knowledge. Each modality is processed and analyzed by specific algorithms. A data fusion approach based on fuzzy logic with a set of rules directed by medical recommendations, is used to fuse the various subsystem outputs. This multimodal fusion increases the reliability of the whole system by detecting several distress situations. In fact this fusion approach takes into account temporary sensor malfunction and increases the system reliability and the robustness in the case of environmental disturbances or material limits (Battery, RF range, etc.). The Fuzzy logic fusion methods brings high flexibility to the telemonitoring platform especially in combining modalities or adding other sensors. The proposed telemonitoring system will ensure pervasive in-home health monitoring for elderly people.},

abstract={Social Networking Sites have become useful tools to strengthen communication with family and friends. Older adults, however, are often hesitant to use SNSs and are reluctant adopters of modern communication media. This results in an asymmetric condition, where younger and older adults use different media and communication channels. To balance communication practices we integrated classic media based on pen and paper with online social networks. In this paper we present a 36 weeks deployment study with an extended family (n=12) of the use of Tlatosketch, a hybrid system based on a digital photo frame, and digital pen and paper technology. This combination allows older adults to stay updated on Facebook and to post paper notes to Facebook. Our results show that Tlatosketch provides the older adult with a new media for self-expression, and improves the family social experience, thus helping them remain active while ageing. We close discussing directions for future work.},

The overall accuracy of the 1-NN method was nearly 100%. The learning method for neural network used was the backpropagation with momentum.

abstract={Recent studies have shown that people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) over time although not all MCI cases progress to dementia. The diagnosis of MCI is important to allow prompt treatment and disease management before the neurons degenerate to a stage beyond repair. Hence, the ability to obtain a method of identifying MCI is of great importance. VREAD is a quick, easy and friendly tool that was developed with an aim to investigate cognitive functioning in a group of healthy elderly and those with MCI. It focuses on the task of following a route, since Topographical Disorientation (TD) is common in AD. The results shows that this novel simulation was able to predict with about 90% overall accuracy using weighting function proposed to discriminate between MCI and healthy elderly.},

We found that the main value perceived by participants in the medication reminder system was its ability to provide multiple channels for them to be reminded of medications. The mobile phone, due to its advantages in portability and privacy, was considered to be the most useful device on which to receive reminders. Most participants saw value in receiving secondary reminders on other devices in their home such as the TV, PC, and other in-home accessories.

abstract={This paper describes some development work of a system for elder care configured around sensors and robotic environment. A few sub-systems have been amalgamated to achieve the desired objective. The integrated system is able to support people who wish to live alone but, because of old age, ill health or disability, are at risk and are a cause of concern for their family and friends. The first part of the integrated system, named Selective Activity Monitoring (SAM) system, works on the principle of using sensor units (SU) to monitor various electrical appliances in a house. Rules, based on the daily activities of a person, are defined for the appliances to be monitored. The system can detect violation of the rules and generate an alarm. The rules are flexible and can be user-defined. The second part of the system is a low-cost Physiological Parameters Monitoring (PPM) system, called Medicmate, which can be used to monitor physiological parameters of a human subject such as body temperature, blood oxygen level and heart rate. It can also detect a fall. The third part of the system is a Web-enabled, robot-based vision system. The robot, operating in a home environment, can be remote controlled by a computer over the Internet. The camera, mounted on the robot, can be used to send a picture of the affected area.},

In this paper we propose a network based Wireless Single PMS (NWSPMS), which can monitor multiple patients to measure various physical parameters. This must be precise, fast and effective for transmission of information about their health condition to the concerned. Also there lies a need to transmit more parameters and more data for the convenience and fast response by the staffs in the hospital. Since we need an immediate response, we make use of the voice-call facility apart from the SMS mechanism via an GSM modem. The system proposed here monitors blood pressure, heart beat rate, body temperature and ECG of the elderly patient thus giving an overall condition of the patient.},

However, due to the limited resources available in such constrained devices, it is challenging to exploit expensive cryptographic operations in the conventional security protocols.

abstract={Ambient assisted living (AAL) can be defined as “the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in a person's daily living and working environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected and live independently into old age” (www.aal-europe.eu). Research in the AAL community covers a wide range of topics, but one of the largest is human activity recognition and behavior understanding, with the objectives of detecting and recognizing actions, activity, and situations within an environment. AAL systems go beyond observing to interact with users. A frequently employed form of human-machine interaction is via prompts-for example, prompting the user to perform the next step in a sequence of actions. Another type of interaction is haptic responses, which have been used in systems for visually impaired people. Two important elements of an appropriate response are an understanding of the user's context and anticipatory capability. Context awareness underpins much of AAL research-human activities are generally context dependent. In the broader sense, context awareness uses sensor observations to abstract information about the current situation. Endowing a system with predictive capability lets it anticipate and thereby produce a timely and useful response.},

abstract={In response to elderly people with independent living, healthcare services for elderly people is intended to be provided at homes, particularly for elderly with long-term care services and some disabilities. The health service can be facilitated utilizing the use of ubiquitous home care, equipped by connected technologies. Interoperability system has an important role in ubiquitous home care. By understanding the system interoperability requirements, the resulting ubiquitous home care system design becomes more effectively. Unfortunately, usability in designing ubiquitous home care is still less concern. Lack of usability concern will contribute in poorly designed of home care system for elderly. Elderly people will get difficulties in learning and operating the system. Poor designed system can create many human errors. Designing a user friendly ubiquitous home care system based on needs and preferences of elderly is such an important thing. The objective of this paper is to investigate a ubiquitous home care model for the elderly from the perspective of human centered design and interoperability. As a result, a well-designed home care for elderly people based on human centered approach will be able to encapsulate interoperability problems among medical devices.},

abstract={Falls amongst the elderly is becoming a major problem with over 50% of elderly hospitalizations due to injury from fall related accidents. Healthcare expenses are dramatically rising due to growing elderly population. Many current technologies for gait analysis are laboratory-based and can incur substantial costs for the healthcare sector for treatment of falls. However utilization of alternative commercially available technologies can potentially reduce costs. Accelerometers are one such option, being ambulatory motion sensors for the detection of orientation and movement. Smart mobile devices are considered as non-invasive and increasingly contain accelerometers for detecting device orientation. This study looks at the capabilities of the accelerometer within a smart mobile device, namely the iPhone, for identification of gait events from walking along a flat surface. The results prove that it is possible to extract features from the accelerometer of an iPhone such as step detection, stride time and cadence.},

For older adults, there is a need for assistance to use the instruments adequately and to solve technical failures. Following the eHealth concept, we designed a computer assistant for an older adult and a technical specialist, which supports remote collaborative troubleshooting which tailors the feedback to the userspsila needs. We evaluated two feedback styles, i.e., cooperative and directive, in the TNO experience lab, with older and younger adults playing the role of patient and technical specialist, respectively, in ldquofailure scenariosrdquo. Results show that most effective troubleshooting occurs with teams consisting of a older patient receiving cooperative feedback and a younger technical specialist receiving directive feedback.

Our study concluded that different user groups require different feedback styles and that computer assistance for remote collaborative troubleshooting will be optimal when this feedback is personalized.},

abstract={This paper presents a wireless non-contact sensor that enables detection, localization, and monitoring of people along with their specific features such as gait and cardiopulmonary activities. These types of sensors can be embedded in the environment and networked with the existing wireless infrastructure to create an intelligent and responsive ambient where the health of children, patients, and the elderly can be monitored without intrusion. None of the common sensing modalities including visible optical, infra-red, and ultra-sound can operate under different visibility conditions, without Line-Of-Sight (LOS), under environmental noise, and measure human-specific features simultaneously. Radio Frequency (RF) sensors have been used to localize humans, and monitor their gait and vital signs. Most of these RF sensors transmit a Continuous Wave (CW) modulated or un-modulated waveform and detect the Doppler shift caused by the movement of hearts, lungs, and other body parts the latter referred to as micro-Doppler technique. RF sensors do not require LOS and work under extreme weather and visibility conditions.},

After that, we discussed about the embedding dimension and the delay time of different ages of people. Finally, we carried out an experiment with commercial device, and proposed a evaluation method based signal quality, then analyzed the tracking performance.

abstract={The design of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to create better living conditions for the elderly, especially those who choose to live in their own houses, as long as possible. To this objective, AAL systems must mainly monitor the health status of the elderly through the analysis of data gathered via technologies based on sensor devices. Sensors networks produce collections of data of fine-grained nature, regarding general information such as device name, data type, data value, timestamp, but also specific one. The data analysis, due to its granularity and heterogeneity, makes very difficult to infer a clear overall view of the status of the elderly, it demands automatic tools for selecting meaningful data and mapping them in a common conceptual schema. In the last decade, ontologies became widely used tool to describe application domains and to enrich data with its meaning. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based methodology to perform semantic queries on a data repository, where records originated from networks of heterogeneous sources are stored. A semantic query is a pattern matching process that supports the recognition of specific temporal sequences of events that can be extracted from fine-grained data. In our framework a domain ontology are exploited at different levels of abstraction and the reasoning techniques are used to pre-process data for the final temporal analysis. The proposed approach is a deliverable of the ongoing AALISABETH project funded by Region Marche Government; while the software component is integrated into the AALISABETH framework.},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Identifying different walking conditions is essential in order to monitor the activities of elderly population for active living or fast recovery of a patient following a surgery or even for prognosis and diagnosis of several conditions like Parkinson's disease. This paper looks at automatically detecting three different walking conditions (walking normally with preferred walking speed (PWS), walking while carrying a glass of water, and walking blind folded) using inertial sensor data. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes were used to acquire movement data from both feet during the three gait tasks. Five healthy young subjects undertook 10 trials per condition on a GAITRite mat. Statistical properties such as the mean, standard deviation (std), skewness (skew) and kurtosis were calculated for each trial that included several gait cycles' data. Altogether 48 features were analyzed using Fuzzy Clustering Mean (FCM) algorithm to verify the separable nature of sensor data. The results show that three clusters could be found with an almost equal number of points; however the membership was not high enough to result in complete discrete clusters. Then three different Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to examine whether the conditions could be automatically classified based on the features that were extracted from inertial sensor data. The results indicate 83-84% of accurate classification of the three gait conditions with three SVM algorithms. The study demonstrates that the inertial sensor data could be used to classify differences in walking conditions using powerful computational intelligence techniques.},

Although the elderly have wisdom and wealth gathered from their life experiences, they require special assistance, higher health insurance costs, and even constant monitoring. By utilizing information process and communications technology, ambient assisted living (AAL) communications open up a new way to address such needs for the aged and the sick. Specifically, AAL uses ambient technologies, including data sensing, processing, transmission, and artificial intelligence, to enable new products, services, and processes that help to provide safe, healthy lives for the aged and disabled. It also supports improved social connections and accessibility to the external world. With the growth of AAL environment, the accessibility gets more challenging for the complex data structure.},

abstract={The elderly population worldwide has an increasing expectation of well-being and life expectancy. The monitoring of elderly people on an individual basis, in a medical sense, will not be a viable proposition in the future. The infrastructure available is not adequate to meet all expectations and subsequently people will continue to live at home with inadequate care. Prior research has shown an accelerated need for the expansion in the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) domain and to that end we present a novel learning technique for intelligent agents that are embedded in Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs). A novel agent that combines an emotion recognition system with a fuzzy logic based learning and adaptation technique provides for an automated self-learning system that constantly adapts to individual requirements. This agent, entitled Health Adaptive Emotion Fuzzy Agent (HAOEFA), has the ability to model and learn the user behaviour in order to control the environment on their behalf with respect to his/her emotional preferences. In addition, the agent incorporates temporal adaption in order to facilitate changing behaviour and preferences within the environment. The results show that such architecture can both provide monitoring and ambient environmental control features such that users with limited physical or cognitive functions can have their well-being advanced with limited external resources.},

abstract={Human motion analysis provides a valuable solution for monitoring the well-being of the elderly, quantifying post-operative patient recovery and monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. The development of accurate motion analysis models, however, requires the integration of multi-sensing modalities and the utilization of appropriate data analysis techniques. This paper describes a robust framework for improved patient motion analysis by integrating information captured by body and visual sensor networks. Real-time target extraction is applied and a skeletonization procedure is subsequently carried out to quantify the internal motion of moving target and compute two metrics, spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory, for each vision node. Extracted motion metrics from multiple vision nodes and accelerometer information from a wearable body sensor are then fused at the feature level by using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and used to classify target's walking gait into normal or abnormal. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

As care and rehabilitation practices move, to a greater extent, out of the hospitals and into private homes a new take on PD is needed to facilitate design activities with patients or laypeople as the primary user groups and to design healthcare applications to be used primarily in the home. This paper discusses challenges and possibilities related to the design of home-based healthcare applications and especially the users' possibilities for participation in creative PD activities. Based upon ongoing design-work, related to home-based rehabilitation of elderly suffering from vestibular dysfunction (dizziness), this paper presents lessons learned and initial outcomes related to patient/citizen-focused development of healthcare solutions for private homes. We present initial ideas on how PD can be used to develop pervasive healthcare applications with less resourceful user-groups such as elderly people suffering from illness.},

Algorithms for detection of those components and for computation of their duration and the duration of the whole TUG are presented. An experiment with five elderly patients aged 74-91 years, four female, one male, most multi-morbid has been conducted in a residential care facility in Oldenburg, Germany. Results of the experiment show that aTUG can reliably and precisely measure total duration of TUG and durations of the single components with mean error of only 0.05 seconds and mean standard deviation of 0.59 seconds using especially its force and range measurements.

Possible application fields may be early detection or differential diagnosis in dementia and assessment of fall risk. Regarding the challenges of future health systems due to the demographic change delaying need of care or preventing falls in dementia can help decrease costs while increasing perceived quality of life for people concerned and their carers.

Our previous study suggests that mutual assisted living community, where dwellers make contributions to the community. Thus community resources could be fully utilized and requested services would be provided in a prompt way. We used service oriented architecture (SOA) to orchestrate the available resources inside the community; and we organize the services into different forms such as formal ones (carried out by professionals, etc), informal ones (assisted by relatives, volunteers, .etc) and even as group activities. We expect such a community could help not only efficiently utilizing the social resources in maintaining the independent living of the elderly people, but also helping these people maintain their connections to the society and bring them entertainment, so that the quality of their living standard may be improved at the same time. This paper continues the track of the previous studies on building mutual assistance communities. Service matching algorithms are developed providing flexible choices on both requested services content and the organization forms of the services.},

abstract={The increasing size of the elderly population is driving the development of ambient assisted living systems and telehealth. The recognition of the user's everyday activities and detection of alarming situations are important components of such systems. Moreover, the monitoring of vital signs, like the ECG, has a key role in telecare and telemonitoring systems. Therefore, in this paper we propose a system that monitors the user by combining an ECG sensor and two accelerometers. Our system recognizes the user's activities and detects falls using the accelerometer data. The ECG data is analyzed in order to extract relevant physiological signals: heart rate, respiration rate, etc. In order to improve the reliability and robustness of the system, the measured accelerometer signals can be combined with the ECG signal in order to detect anomalies in the user's behavior and heart-related problems. The proposed proof-of-concept system could contribute significantly to the quality, unobtrusiveness and robustness of the health care and patient safety.},

abstract={The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain aims to support the daily life activities of elders, patients with chronic conditions or disabled people, with a focus on ICT (Informatics and Communication Technologies). Important advances in AAL software systems have been already made, assisting people in their home, work, and social environments. Because of their critical nature, these systems must be developed focused on their quality. Hence, quality attributes (QAs), such as safety, reliability, and security, must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. However, there is not a set of QAs specific for AAL systems, hence, new systems have been developed based on general standards, such as ISO/IEC 25010, or based on particular experiences. This paper introduces the QM4AAL, a quality model (QM) for AAL systems. The QM4AAL was established and evaluated based on evidence from several published works found through conduction of a systematic mapping study. As result, the QM4AAL details QAs requirements, adaptive (e.g., self-configuring or situation-aware) or static properties, and stakeholders of AAL systems and their constituents systems (e.g., activity monitoring or health status monitoring systems). We intend this QM can orient the design and assessment of current and future AAL systems.},

abstract={The main objective of this project was to evaluate the sensing system for person detection in the scope of its integration in a mobile robotic platform for Ambient Assisted Living. Two sensors were considered, a camera and a depth sensor. For the camera (2D), 3 different algorithms were implemented: face detection, tracking and recognition. For the depth sensor the whole body detection was tested using skeleton tracking. The results showed that the face detection and recognition algorithms had a very small range, and the face tracking demonstrated to reach a higher distance. However, the latter exhibited poor results when confronted with illumination variations. The skeleton tracking algorithm provided good results, being capable of tracking relatively close to the sensor and up to 3 meters distance. Thus, the 2D face recognition can be used for short distances to identify the person, while the 3D skeleton tracking can be appropriated for distant tracking of the person. This work showed that the integration of these sensing systems, in a robotic platform, can make a robust robot capable of human interaction in home environments.},

Home assistive technologies were initially developed to support people with special needs and elderly people - and among other things - to help them remain within their homes and communities for as long as is feasible and safe. Our work focuses an the other end of the technology and design spectrum: one where Tele-medicine is used to support optimal palliative care at home, for children at the end of their lives. We present preliminary results of a pilot study. We argue that remote care provision should be considered as an integral part of care, to complement and enhance current end of life care - as well as providing advice and support - regardless of where patients reside. We advocate that future developments in assistive living technologies adopt an increasingly holistic "whole-of-life" approach, including the too often understudied and under-reported end-of-life phase.},

Periodic collection of patients' data is important to gather more accurate measurements and to avoid common risky situations. The presented proposal monitors elderly people, storing collected data in a personal computer, tablet, or smartphone through Bluetooth.

abstract={Human movement pattern can be a valuable information for rehabilitation therapy, sport medicine and elderly people monitoring, but acquisition of them through multi-cite accelerormeters would result in uncomfortable wearing and complex data processing. In this paper, method of using a single waist-fixed accelerometer to detect human movement pattern was investigated and evaluated. 10 subjects were asked to run or walk on a treadmill in a regular way. A 5th order Butterworth low pass filter with cutoff frequency 20Hz was designed to filter the acceleration data and denoise the sample. By collecting the velocity from treadmill as label data and the individual's waist acceleration data, training data set was established. A Bayesian network classifier trained by EM learning algorithm was developed for human movement pattern assessing. Experiment showed that the method could predict the human walking and running state with a considerable accuracy more than 90%. Such accuracy could also be achieved even with a single superior-inferior acceleration feature. The classification of fast speed walking and normal speed one also achieved satisfying result. This indicated that in some application in which walking and running state were only needed to classify could employ the low power, low computational complexity uniaxial accelerometer as the human movement detector.},

abstract={The ageing population that becomes a predominant demographic feature in most countries raises new challenges in healthcare. Over the past years, the focus was shifted from institutional-based healthcare to automatic healthcare systems by leveraging the sensing technologies and the communication infrastructures. The aim is to provide the elderly and people with physical and/or cognitive impairment with intelligent and assistive health services in a pervasive, timely and cost effective manner. In this paper we propose an integrated healthcare framework that enables pervasive and personalized health services. The proposed framework is based on a M2M infrastructure towards high scalability and easy service deployment. In addition, using ontology as information model provides deep semantic and expressiveness in the domain knowledge enabling thus more interoperability and service personalization and automation through logic-based reasoning.},

abstract={As the elder population is increasing every year, spending on elder healthcare is also increasing. Older adult rate is increasing rapidly and is expected to double by 2030 to 20% increase in world population. A huge part of the healthcare expenditure is expected to be spent on older individuals particularly those with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson diseases, stroke patients in their rehabilitation phase which require continuous monitoring and medical care. This research work makes use of smart phones which have become ubiquitous and the capability of mobile networks having increased multifold in short duration, to address these issues. A constant and reliable assistive technology is essential while taking care of home-bound patients and elders. The proposed system has sensors to monitor the heart rate, body temperature, ECG, respiration rate, tilt and fall. Blood pressure can also be measured in cuff-less manner. The sensors are attached to the body of the elderly or home-bound patient in a wearable fashion. The data from the sensors can be sent to any Smartphone with Bluetooth support. In critical situations the caretaker will be given a notification via smartphone. Cuff-less BP monitoring will be a boon in case of continuous monitoring of health parameters.},

We analyze their sleep patterns, propose a set of measures to assess the quantity and quality of sleep, and visualize the sleep patterns for a telecare service provider and carers to support users with dementia. Results show that people with early dementia have more alternations of sleep-wake cycles than healthy elderly people, and assistive technology can provide objective and ubiquitous monitoring of sleep patterns for health care purposes.},

abstract={mHealth (healthcare using mobile wireless technologies) has the potential to improve healthcare and the quality of life for elderly and chronic patients. Many studies from all over the world have addressed this issue in view of the aging population in many countries. However, there has been a lack of any consolidated evidence-based study to classify mHealth from the dual perspectives of healthcare and technology. This paper reports the results of an evidence-based study of mHealth solutions for chronic care amongst the elderly population and proposes a taxonomy of a broad range of mHealth solutions from the perspective of technological complexity. A systematic literature review was conducted over 10 online databases and the findings were classified into four categories of predominant mHealth solutions, that is, self-healthcare, assisted healthcare, supervised healthcare and continuous monitoring. The findings of the study have major implications for information management and policy development in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to healthcare in the world.},

abstract={The use of context-aware technology in the home enables new ways to stimulate elderly in increasing their exercise levels, and consequently prevent age-related health issues amongst an increasing elderly population. This paper describes the design of a persuasive virtual coach that encourages seniors to walk more. In order to incorporate the user values and needs in the design concept, a user panel of elderly people was actively involved in the design process. A range of persuasive principles and interaction metaphors were evaluated with the user panel, resulting in a design concept that was approved and appreciated by the user panel. The design concept combines a pedometer with wireless connectivity with a touch-screen photo frame. As a first step towards a longer evaluation, an experimental prototype was tested in the field with two participants for 11 days each. Whereas the participants of the exploratory intervention did appreciate the virtual coach and they did feel more motivated to exercise, the quantitative figures did not yet show an increase in physical activity in time; a possible explanation could be the limited activity-sensing capabilities of the prototype in combination with the changing weather conditions in the course of the user study. Furthermore, the participants would like to see a system with a better awareness of the context of use, such that the system can better select the right timing for motivational cues. These findings will be used to improve the design concept and perform a longitudinal user study in the field.},

year={2005}, 
pages={521-527}, 
abstract={Owing to the significant scale of the aging population and the cost involved, efforts for driving quality lifestyle of the elderly is crucial. Recently, eCare (electronic care) has been an important issue of health care that utilizes the Web technologies to improve the quality of health care. However, existing aging services (health care or eCare) are mostly oriented to clinical gerontology or neurophysiology of aging. Certain quality dimensions are disregarded such as community involvement, consumer participation and continuous quality improvement. This paper devises a novel notion called iCare (intelligent care) which extends eCare (electronic care) technologies to a domain of ambient e-services that meet the desired quality elements. The objective of iCare is to provide quality e-services to the elderly people anywhere and anytime. In other words, iCare is more oriented toward the behavioral and social angel of quality-aging e-services. We also present an iCare e-services framework that comprises an iCare e-service ontology and an e-service provision quality model. This framework functionally addresses what and how to unfold ambient iCare e-services. That is, the framework implies a future roadmap of quality-aging e-services that can be particularly accounted as affectionate technologies.},

abstract={The first cohort of “baby boomers” are now 65 years or older, presaging a massive wave of aging “boomers” that could degrade health care and elder care over the next quarter-century. Cost-effective, high-impact technologies for aging, disabilities and independent living are urgently needed. In this paper, we present our experience in building “assistive environments” for older adults-the Gator Tech Smart House (GTSH) project. Numerous R&D efforts similar to ours are either underway or have recently been conducted. In most of these projects, prototypes have been built to achieve independence, well being, and in general, good quality of life. But prototyping a technology is one thing; commercial proliferation and creating a vibrant industry around such technology is an altogether different proposition. From the lessons learned in the GTSH, we analyze the impediments hindering the emergence of products and services for assistive environments, and present the blueprints of an ecosystem based on requirements drawn from the lessons learned. We believe the proposed ecosystem is an important beginning to providing better conditions for an accelerated proliferation of next-generation smart homes and assistive environments.},

abstract={An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.},

abstract={In this paper we present a Health Emergency Event Notification system, which is intended to support the monitorization of the elderly health care; focusing on seamless service mobility paradigm. The system is composed by five features: i) the vital signs recording, ii) emergency contact phone numbers register (for SMS - Short Message Service and phone calls), iii) monitorization profile creation, iv) messages notification management, and v) local mobile storage service. Our architecture was designed to drive information through the WiFi / Cellular network from a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) even when there is not real-time connection. This proposal considers as restriction connectivity costs. The proposal was designed considering the Scenario-Based Design methodology. In formation is related to a project conducted a long one year in Harmony house. Meanwhile, we were designing the communication infrastructure. Our architecture was evaluated by 2 caregivers and 2 nurses from Harmony house. The results showed high scores in analyzed aspects: perceived ease of use, usefulness and intended use. We conclude that in order to complement and enhance the initial design, it is necessary to carry out an in-site evaluation. Our future work includes to analyze the architecture performance under different connectivity scenarios.},

abstract={This piece of research describes an innovative e-health service that supports the cognitive and physical training of senior citizens and promotes their active ageing. The approach is adopted by the Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project, elements of which are discussed herein in the light of the functionalities provided to the users and the therapists. The aim of this work is to describe those technical elements that demonstrate the unique and integrative character of the LLM service, which is based on a modular Web service architecture, rendering the system available in different settings like the homes of seniors. The underlying database as well as the remote user interface empower therapists to set personalized training schemes, to view the progress of training sessions, as well as, adding new games and exercises into the system, thereby increasing the services sustainability and marketability.},

abstract={A new approach for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal monitoring and analysis for the homecare of elderly person or patients is designed and implemented. Developed platform for real-time analysis of ECG signals on sensor node can be used as an advanced diagnosis and alarming system. Sensor node does not need to transmit ECG data all time in wireless sensor network and to server. Firstly sensor node can detect abnormality in ECG then transfer abnormal ECG data in the network to server for further analysis. This system can be used to reduce data packet overload and to save power consumption in wireless sensor network. It can also increase the server performance by reducing load. The ECG features are used to detect life-threatening arrhythmias with an emphasis of analyzing QRS complex in ECG signals at a sensor node. Based on abnormal ECG activity due to R-R interval and QRS width, the sensor node can transfer ECG data to the server for extended and cautious ECG analysis and disease classification. Needed information of abnormal ECG of a patient the server can then be transferred to the doctor's personal digital assistant (PDA) for further diagnostics.},

year={2008}, 
pages={1-5}, 
abstract={Ambient assisted living is a paradigm that promotes independency in the old age with the support of advanced technologies. Ambient home care systems (AHCS) are specially design for this purpose; they aim at minimizing the potential risks that living alone may suppose for an elder, thanks to their capability of gathering data of the user, inferring information about his activity and state, and taking decisions on it. In this paper, we present a number of context-aware services (heart rate monitoring, medication prompting, generation of agenda reminders, weather alerts, emergency notifications, etc.) for the elder and his caregivers. They run on the top of an AHCS, which collects data from a network of environmental, health and physical sensors. The AHCS follows a layered fusion architecture, formed by an in-home developed context acquisition framework and a context manager (customized on the Context Toolkit) that holds the inference and reasoning functionalities. On the deployed prototype, we analyze the suitability of the selected technical approach for ambient assisted living applications.},
