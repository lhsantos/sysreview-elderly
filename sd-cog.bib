abstract = "Abstract Age related cognitive decline comes at a significant economic, social, and health cost. Interventions that prevent or slow cognitive decline and encourage positive ageing have potential to produce significant societal benefits and are a rapidly growing enterprise. Currently little is known about how individual difference factors influence adherence to the training regimes and training outcomes. The aim of the present study was to identify the personality and metacognitive beliefs that predict individuals' adherence to a regular training regime and the likelihood that they discontinue training. A sample of 831 older Australians drawn from registered users of a commercial brain training program, performed a range of personality and non-cognitive measures, specifically: need for cognition, implicit theories of intelligence, mastery beliefs, memory self-concept, and big-5 personality factors. The training frequency and performance of participants was tracked over an 18-month period. The results suggest that, within a sample of existing brain trainers, openness to experience, need for cognition, and age predicted training discontinuation. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that openness to experience, implicit theories of intelligence, and age influenced game performance. Implications of such findings for the effective design and application of cognitive training for encouraging positive ageing are discussed. "

Analyse the characteristics of unstructured time in the healthy elderly. 2. Verify the relationship between types of leisure and cognitive functions. Methodology The study included 72 retired persons distributed into three groups: Group \{G1\} (participants in Senior University programs), \{G2\} (participants in a memory training program), and \{G3\} (table games players). The measurements applied include the Clock Test, registering daily activities, and several cognitive tests. Results The analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons were performed. \{G1\} and \{G2\} groups gave more precise details on the distribution of time, and they both practice more cognitive activities than G3, which prefers social activities. \{G1\} practiced “active rest”, as opposed to passive rest by \{G2\} and G3, which was mainly watching \{TV\} or sleeping siesta. Cognitive measurements are significantly better in \{G1\} than in any other group, while the results of \{G2\} were significantly higher than G3. Conclusions The type of leisure activities is positive and significantly related to a richer and more intense planning of non-structured time and with a better cognitive level. "

This article returns to the autonomy concept, and evokes the plethora of technologies (through Internet, mobile health, sensors, cognitive technologies, serious games, robotics, exoskeleton, and many others) that are currently emerging, in order to examine the type of autonomy they intend to favour. It questions also the Silver economy, whose purpose is to build an economical development resulting from the virtuous circle which articulates elders needs for autonomy, the ageing challenges, industrial products, public and private stakeholders, family and professional caregivers, and need for a sustainable development. This reflection will then lead to the core of the ethical question of the meaning and the roles of technology for health and care. Especially, it will suggest a way to collectively build these meaning and roles; this way is in the opposite course of the techno-hubris, and of the economical, ecological, demographical and political disorders.

This will create an enormous cost for governments, families and individuals. Brain plasticity and its role in brain adaptation to the process of aging is influenced by other changes as a result of co-morbidities, environmental factors, personality traits (psychosocial variables) and genetic and epigenetic factors. This review summarizes recent findings obtained mostly from interventional studies that aim to prevent and/or delay age-related cognitive decline in healthy adults. There are a multitude of such studies. In this paper, we focused our review on physical activity, computerized cognitive training and social enhancement interventions on improving cognition, physical health, independent living and wellbeing of older adults. The methodological limitations of some of these studies, and the need for new multi-domain synergistic interventions, based on current advances in neuroscience and social-brain theories, are discussed.

Nevertheless, the intensity of the physical activity reached with the existing solutions is rarely sufficient to obtain a real impact on the physical fitness and thus on the health status of this population. In this context, a Point Cloud Based System (PCBS) has been developed to interface ordinary motorized treadmills with exergames through a simple RGB-D camera, to induce players to perform physical activities at higher intensities. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of \{PCBS\} to measure the walking speed of a subject on a standard motorized treadmill based on the image streams of an RGB-D camera. Methods 36 participants performed three 10 min walking exercises, divided in 5 blocks of 2 min at the following constant ordered speeds: 0.42, 0.69, 0.97, 1.25 and 1.53 m s−1. The measured walking speeds are compared to those obtained through a Marker Based Control System (MBCS). Results Results showed a high system accuracy (bias: 0.013 ± 0.015 m s−1), a good reliability (ICC = 0.63–0.91) and a low variability (SEM = 1–5%; \{MD\} = 2.7–14%). Discussion Accuracy and reliability of \{PCBS\} are consistent with those obtained in similar existing systems measuring gait parameters. Conclusion Within the context of the development of exergames, \{PCBS\} may be combined with exergames to perform physical activities at sufficiently high intensities in the elderly population, in order to improve their physical health and possibly prevent/delay cognitive impairment.

abstract = "Abstract Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and begins with a subtle decline in episodic memory followed by a more general decline in overall cognitive abilities. Though the exact trigger for this cascade of events remains unknown the presence of the misfolded amyloid-beta protein triggers reactive gliosis, a prominent neuropathological feature in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The cytoskeletal and morphological changes of astrogliosis are its evident features, while changes in oxidative stress defense, cholesterol metabolism, and gene transcription programs are less manifest. However, these latter molecular changes may underlie a disruption in homeostatic regulation that keeps the brain environment balanced. Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease show changes in glutamate and \{GABA\} signaling and recycling, potassium buffering, and in cholinergic, purinergic, and calcium signaling. Ultimately the dysregulation of homeostasis maintained by astrocytes can have grave consequences for the stability of microcircuits within key brain regions. Specifically, altered inhibition influenced by astrocytes can lead to local circuit imbalance with farther reaching consequences for the functioning of larger neuronal networks. Healthy astrocytes have a role in maintaining and modulating normal neuronal communication, synaptic physiology and energy metabolism, astrogliosis interferes with these functions. This review considers the molecular and functional changes occurring during astrogliosis in Alzheimer's disease, and proposes that astrocytes are key players in the development of dementia. "

Methods \{EEG\} was recorded in 30 Nold, 30 aMCI, and 30 \{AD\} during \{EC\} and EO. Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity was used to weight the network. Results In Nold, in \{EO\} condition, the brain network is characterized by more \{SW\} (higher SW) in alpha bands and less \{SW\} (lower SW) in beta2 and gamma bands. In aMCI, \{SW\} has the same trend, except for delta and theta bands where the network shows less small worldness. \{AD\} shows a similar trend of Nold, but with less fluctuations between EO/EC conditions. Furthermore, in both conditions, aMCI \{SW\} architecture presents midway properties between \{AD\} and Nold. At low frequencies (delta e theta bands) in EC, aMCI group presents network’s architecture similar to Nold, while in \{EO\} aMCI, \{SW\} is superimposable to \{AD\} ones. Conclusions In resting state condition, aMCI small-world architecture presents midway topological properties between \{AD\} subjects and healthy controls, confirming the hypothesis that aMCI is an intermediate step along the disease progression. Significance We proposed the application of graph theory to \{EEG\} in reactivity to \{EO\} in order to find a marker of diagnosis that – in association with other techniques of neuroimaging – could be sensitive to the progression of \{MCI\} or conversion into AD.

While there is clear evidence of Mn neurotoxicity in pediatric and adult occupational populations, little is known about effects in the elderly who may exhibit enhanced susceptibilities due to compromised physiology compared to younger adults. In the province of Brescia, Italy, the Valcamonica area has been the site of three ferroalloy plants operating from 1902 to 2001. Metal emissions of Mn and to a lesser extent lead (Pb) have impacted the surrounding environment, where a high prevalence of Parkinsonism was previously observed. This study aimed to assess neurocognitive and motor functions in healthy elderly subjects residing for most of their lifetime in Valcamonica or in a reference area unimpacted by ferroalloy plant activity. Methods Subjects were enrolled for extensive neurobehavioral assessment of motor, cognitive and sensory functions. Exposure was assessed with 24 h personal air sampling for \{PM10\} airborne particles, surface soil and tap water measurement at individual households, Mn levels in blood and urine and Pb in blood. Dose–response relationships between exposure indicators and biomarkers and health outcomes were analyzed with generalized (linear and logistic) additive models (GAM). Results A total of 255 subjects (55% women) were examined; most (52.9%) were within the 65–70 years age class. Average airborne Mn was 26.41 ng/m3 (median 18.42) in Valcamonica and 20.96 ng/m3 (median 17.62) in the reference area. Average Mn in surface soil was 1026 ppm (median 923) in Valcamonica and 421 ppm (median 410) in the reference area. Manganese in drinking water was below the \{LDL\} of 1 μg/L. The \{GAM\} analysis showed significant association between airborne Mn (p = 0.0237) and the motor coordination tests of the Luria Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. The calculation of the Benchmark Dose using this dose–response relationship yielded a lower level confidence interval of 22.7 ng/m3 (median 26.4). For the odor identification score of the Sniffin Stick test, an association was observed with soil Mn (p = 0.0006) and with a significant interaction with blood Pb (p = 0.0856). Significant dose–responses resulted also for the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices with the distance from exposure point source (p = 0.0025) and Mn in soil (p = 0.09), and for the Trail Making test, with urinary Mn (p = 0.0074). Serum prolactin (PRL) levels were associated with air (p = 0.061) and urinary (p = 0.003) Mn, and with blood Pb (p = 0.0303). In most of these associations age played a significant role as an effect modifier. Conclusion Lifelong exposure to Mn was significantly associated with changes in odor discrimination, motor coordination, cognitive abilities and serum \{PRL\} levels. These effects are consistent with the hypothesis of a specific mechanism of toxicity of Mn on the dopaminergic system. Lead co-exposure, even at very low levels, can further enhance Mn toxicity. "

We analyzed brain activity in 41 elderly subjects performing a 3-stimulus visual oddball task. In addition to the average amplitude of event-related fields in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), high-gamma power in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the strength of high-gamma imaginary coherence between the right \{MFG\} and the left MFG, and those between the right \{MFG\} and the left thalamus predicted individual differences in reaction time. In addition, high-gamma power in the left \{MFG\} was correlated with task accuracy, whereas high-gamma power in the left thalamus and left \{IPS\} was correlated with individual processing speed. The direction of correlations indicated that higher high-gamma power or coherence in an attention network was associated with better task performance and, presumably, higher cognitive function. Thus, high-gamma activity in different regions of this attention network differentially contributed to attentional processing, and such activity could be a fundamental process associated with individual differences in cognitive aging.

Challenging aging brains through cognitive training and physical exercises has shown to be effective against age-related cognitive decline and disease. But how effective are such training interventions? What is the optimal combination/strategy? Is there enough evidence from neuropsychological observations, animal studies, as well as, structural and functional neuroimaging investigations to interpret the underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the observed neuroplasticity of the aging brain? This piece of work summarizes recent findings toward these questions, but also highlights the role of functional brain connectivity work, an emerging discipline for future research in healthy aging and the study of the underlying mechanisms across the life span. The ultimate aim is to conclude on recommended multimodal training, in light of contemporary trends in the design of exergaming interventions.

Methods A population-based, random-digit dialing strategy surveyed 1,039 older adults. The Behavioral Model of Health Services Use was used as a conceptual framework for a questionnaire testing constructs from several behavioral theories. Structural equation modeling assessed the relationship of latent variables to each construct with goodness-of-fit indices. Results The study had an 82% response rate and 72% completer rate. The respondents' mean age was 62.7 ± 10.2 years (range, 50 to 97 years). The sample was 67% women, 86% were white, and less than 40% had personal experience with AD. Respondents were nondemented (Short Blessed scores, 1.7 ± 2.2). Predictors of intention to screen included perceived benefits (γ = .35), knowledge of dementia (γ = .26), self-efficacy (γ = .23), preventive health behaviors (γ = .17), and perceived susceptibility (γ = .14). Knowledge was positively correlated with perceived benefits (φ = .29) and susceptibility (φ = .20). Preventive behaviors (φ = .20) were positively correlated with perceived benefits. Self-efficacy correlated positively with preventive behaviors (φ = .24) and perceived benefits (φ = .37) and negatively with perceived susceptibility (φ = −.11). Goodness-of-fit indices suggested a good fit of this model (root mean square error of approximation, .037; comparative fit index, 0.98; relative fit index; .96). Discussion Older adults who have knowledge of dementia and perceive benefit from diagnosis and treatment are more likely to exhibit willingness and confidence to be tested for cognitive problems. Individuals with high self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, and positive preventive health behaviors are also more likely to exhibit intention. These constructs can now be used to develop interventions to evaluate cognitive health in the elderly. "

Previous studies have demonstrated altered gamma oscillations in the elderly population that may be related to general cognitive decline. However, it is unknown how gamma oscillations change with age or if there is an age when gamma oscillations optimally mediate working memory performance. That is, gamma oscillations may be maximal in middle-aged adults compared to younger and elderly adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate working memory evoked gamma oscillations in adults aged 19–29 years (mean 23.32±2.85 1 SD) compared to adults aged 30–60 years (mean 39.10±8.11 1 SD). Methods Subjects completed the verbal N-back task administered at four working loads (0, 1, 2, 3), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Gamma power was measured during correct responses. Results Reduced gamma oscillations were observed in the adults aged 19–29 compared to those aged 30–60 years. Age was found to be positively related to the power of gamma oscillations. No differences were found on N-Back accuracy. Conclusions Increased working memory evoked gamma oscillatory activity may provide a neurophysiological marker in the healthy aging brain. "

abstract = "Abstract A re-emergence of research on EEG-neurofeedback followed controlled evidence of clinical benefits and validation of cognitive/affective gains in healthy participants including correlations in support of feedback learning mediating outcome. Controlled studies with healthy and elderly participants, which have increased exponentially, are reviewed including protocols from the clinic: sensory-motor rhythm, beta1 and alpha/theta ratios, down-training theta maxima, and from neuroscience: upper-alpha, theta, gamma, alpha desynchronisation. Outcome gains include sustained attention, orienting and executive attention, the P300b, memory, spatial rotation, RT, complex psychomotor skills, implicit procedural memory, recognition memory, perceptual binding, intelligence, mood and well-being. Twenty-three of the controlled studies report neurofeedback learning indices along with beneficial outcomes, of which eight report correlations in support of a meditation link, results which will be supplemented by further creativity and the performing arts evidence in Part II. Validity evidence from optimal performance studies represents an advance for the neurofeedback field demonstrating that cross fertilisation between clinical and optimal performance domains will be fruitful. Theoretical and methodological issues are outlined further in Part III. "

abstract = "Abstract Time perception is a important subject in cognitive psychology, which is essential for our understanding of brain mechanisms underlying human cognition. Many cognitive functions, like learning, memory, language, decision making, or concept formation may be characterized by regular changes in time-varying processes. The patterning in time, therefore, seems an essential feature of our ‘working brains’. Many previous literature reports and studies conducted indicate age-related decline in our mental activity (e.g., Szymaszek, Sereda, Pöppel, &amp; Szelag, 2009; Szelag et al., 2009). Such cognitive deterioration is often observed beyond 65 years of life and accompanied by less efficient timing processes. In the present study, we focused on rapid auditory processing in some tens of milliseconds. The study was aimed at improving cognitive function in elderly following the specific training in temporal information processing using the Fast ForWord (FFW) program. This program is composed of several games designed to improve memory, attention, and sequencing abilities and it was developed to help children with difficulties in reading, writing, and learning Thirty healthy subjects between 65 and 75 years of age were randomly assigned to three groups. One group received temporal training using the FFW. The second group participated in non-temporal training by playing common computer games. The third group underwent no training. Before and after the training, all of the subjects went through a number of tests to measure the level of their cognitive functioning. We assessed: (1) temporal processing by measuring sequencing abilities; (2) three aspects of attention, i.e., vigilance (the ability to sustain attention over a longer period of time), divided attention (the ability to pay attention to multiple processes), and alertness (the ability to maintain a high level of attention in anticipation of a test stimulus); (3) short- term memory with tests evaluating working memory span, as well as the ability to match complex patterns and the ability to recognize a pattern seen earlier. Prior to training no significant differences were found among the three groups. After the training, Group A showed improved temporal information processing accompanied by amelioration of some attentional and memory resources. Our study showed, for the first time, significant benefits of temporal training on broad aspects of cognitive function in elderly. We found that elderly who underwent temporal training improved not only the rate at which they processed auditory temporal information, but also in other cognitive processes. These results support the thesis on the ‘timing-cognition’ interrelationship and offer new horizons for neurorehabilitation of declined mental activity in elderly population (Szelag et al., 2011; Szelag &amp; Skolimowska, 2012).

This study aimed to evaluate an internet-based version of this test when used remotely and self-administered in a cohort of healthy, community-dwelling older adults aged 55 and above over a 12 month period at 1–3 monthly intervals. Test usability and reliability was examined in terms of acceptability, stability and reliability. Of 150 participants (age: 63.6 ± 5.6, range 55–83 years), 143 (95%) successfully completed a valid baseline test. Of these, 67% completed 3 month and 43% 12 months of testing. Technical difficulties were reported by 9% of participants. For those participants who completed 12 months tests, all tasks showed moderate to high stability and test–retest reliability. This brief computerized test battery was shown to have high acceptability for baseline self-administered testing and moderate to high stability for repeated assessments over 12 months. Attrition was high between baseline and 3 months. These data suggest that this tool may be useful for high frequency monitoring of cognitive function over 6–12 months, and deserves further evaluation. "

However, despite the accuracy achieved by the current specialized systems there are constraints that limit quantitative gait analysis, for instance, the cost of the equipment, the limited access for many people and the lack of solutions to consistently monitor gait on a continuous basis. In this paper, two low-cost systems for quantitative gait analysis are presented, a wearable inertial system that relies on two wireless acceleration sensors mounted on the ankles; and a passive vision-based system that externally estimates the measurements through a structured light sensor and 3D point-cloud processing. Both systems are compared with a reference clinical instrument using an experimental protocol focused on the feasibility of estimating temporal gait parameters over two groups of healthy adults (five elders and five young subjects) under controlled conditions. The error of each system regarding the ground truth is computed. Inter-group and intra-group analyses are also conducted to transversely compare the performance between both technologies, and of these technologies with respect to the reference system. The comparison under controlled conditions is required as a previous stage towards the adaptation of both solutions to be incorporated into Ambient Assisted Living environments and to provide continuous in-home gait monitoring as part of the future work.

Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded during a continuous recognition memory task performance.

In comparison with healthy controls, \{MCI\} subjects showed increased theta (p &lt; 0.001), lower beta reduction (p &lt; 0.001) and decreased alpha and gamma power (p &lt; 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) in frontal, temporal and parietal areas during early and late latencies. Our results point towards a dual pattern of activity (increase and decrease) which is indicative of \{MCI\} and specific to certain time windows, frequency bands and brain regions. These results could represent two neurophysiological sides of MCI. Characterizing these opposing processes may contribute to the understanding of the disorder. "

Methods This study is a cross-sectional survey of gambling habits. A random sample of older adults with a scheduled primary-care clinic appointment was selected and screened with the General Health Questionnaire and questions about suicidality and alcohol use. Also, participants were asked about their gambling habits. Results Of 843 screened patients completing the gambling questionnaire, 69.6% reported that they had participated in at least one gambling activity in the last year. At-risk gamblers were defined as those who reported having bet more than $100 on a single bet and/or having bet more than they could afford to lose in the last year. Of those responding, 10.9% were identified as at-risk gamblers. The strongest predictors of at-risk gambling behavior were being a binge drinker, presence of current posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, minority race/ethnicity, and being a \{VA\} clinic patient. Subjects with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment were just as likely as those without impairment to gamble and to report at-risk gambling behavior. At-risk gambling behavior was not significantly associated with gender, current or past depressive symptoms, or cigarette smoking. Conclusions These data raise a significant public health concern that gambling behaviors are prevalent in older adults. Additional research is needed to further define the determinants of gambling behavior in older adults and evaluate the social, health, and economic costs and benefits of gambling by older adults, especially among those groups determined to be at risk.

Interventions Warm-up exercises and Wii Fit training that involved training motor (shifts centre of gravity and step alternation) and cognitive skills. A follow-up evaluative Wii Fit session was held 60 days after the end of training. Participants performed a functional reach test before and after training as a measure of learning transfer. Main outcome measures Learning and retention were determined based on the scores of 10 Wii Fit games over eight sessions. Transfer of learning was assessed after training using the functional reach test. Results Patients with Parkinson's disease showed no deficit in learning or retention on seven of the 10 games, despite showing poorer performance on five games compared with the healthy elderly group. Patients with Parkinson's disease showed marked learning deficits on three other games, independent of poorer initial performance. This deficit appears to be associated with cognitive demands of the games which require decision-making, response inhibition, divided attention and working memory. Finally, patients with Parkinson's disease were able to transfer motor ability trained on the games to a similar untrained task. Conclusions The ability of patients with Parkinson's disease to learn, retain and transfer performance improvements after training on the Nintendo Wii Fit depends largely on the demands, particularly cognitive demands, of the games involved, reiterating the importance of game selection for rehabilitation purposes.

Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures to obtain Small World parameters. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity as extracted by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was used to weight the network. A high statistical correlation between Small World and memory performance was found. Namely, higher Small World characteristic in \{EEG\} gamma frequency band during the resting state, better performance in short-term memory as evaluated by the digit span tests.

The default-mode network (DMN) comprising of such consistent cortical regions has become a topic of increasing interest in both healthy and diseased populations. In this study, using a well-examined version of the verbal n-back task, interleaved with periods of rest blocks, we investigated whether the deactivation of the cortical regions comprising the \{DMN\} moderates individual differences in behavioral performance in a group of older adults. We recruited 25 young and 25 older adults for our study and presented them with blocks of the n-back task, with varying levels of load, interleaved with periods of fixation. A direct comparison of the young and older participants revealed both a reduction in the up-regulation of the prefrontal and parietal regions in response to increasing task demands, along with a reduction in the down-regulation of \{DMN\} regions with increasing cognitive load in the elderly. Better performance in the young adults was associated with the capability to modulate the regions of the working memory network with increasing task difficulty, however enhanced performance in the older cohort was associated with greater load-induced deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex. This study adds to the existing gamut of aging literature, providing evidence that \{DMN\} function is critical to cognitive functioning in older adults. "

Depression also increases the risk of suicide, especially among elderly white men, with a suicide rate in people aged 80 to 84 more than twice that of the general population. The under-diagnosis and under-treatment of depression in older adults has been well documented. In general, effective treatment for depression in the elderly is thought to be the same as for younger patients. Most of the available antidepressants are believed to be equally effective in elderly adults. However, antidepressants may take longer to start working in older people than they do in younger people. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, problem-solving treatment, and interpersonal therapy have the strongest evidence base for treating patients with late-life depression. Finally, particular attention should be paid to complicated grief in late life. In later life, losses commonly include spouses, siblings, and peers, and less commonly adult children and grandchildren. In case of complicated grief, the griever remains preoccupied with reminders of the reality of their loss that are persistent, severe, and pervasive, giving the griever a sense of being stuck in their grief beyond 6 months, and sometimes for decades after the death has occurred. Complicated grief must be taken seriously and treated appropriately. "

abstract = "Introduction The high prevalence of overweight and obesity is a worldwide health problem and is already manifesting in elementary school and even preschool children. Childhood overweight is associated with serious health problems, the risk of premature illness and early death later in life. Furthermore, overweight in early childhood has shown to increase the likelihood of being obese in later childhood and even tracks into adulthood in one-third to one-half of cases. A recent cross-sectional study within the framework of the ENERGY-project (http://www.projectenergy.eu) collected anthropometric data from 10- to 12-year-old children in seven European countries [1]. Results demonstrated that 25.8% of boys were overweight, from which 5.2% obese and that 21.4% of girls were overweight, from which 4.1% obese. The prevalence rates varied greatly across European countries. The results clearly established the highest prevalence rates in the more southern and central European countries, which is similar to the results of previous European studies. Also in preschool aged children, the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity has been found in southern Europe (i.e. Spain and Greece). Within the framework of the ToyBox-study (http://www.toybox-study.eu) secondary data analyses in four- to seven-year-old preschool children from six European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Spain) showed that 8 to 30% of European preschool children have overweight and 1% to 13% of them are obese [2]. Further, previously published figures from developed countries show that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children under the age of five increased in developed countries from 8% in 1990 to 12% in 2010 with an expected prevalence of 14% in 2020. Estimates of childhood obesity generally tend to be higher in the US, but it appears that the gap between continents is getting smaller if \{US\} data are compared to European data. Although childhood obesity is currently showing rather stabilizing trends, the prevalence rates are still high worldwide, which suggests that childhood obesity remains a major public health issue. Changes in lifestyle behaviour are likely to be the main cause of the increase in overweight and obesity, rather than changes in biologic or genetic factors. Weight gain is determined by the cumulative effect of low levels of physical activity, high levels of sedentary behaviour, and unhealthy dietary behaviours, also referred to as energy balance-related behaviours. In this abstract, we will focus on two important energy balance-related behaviours in children: physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Establishing healthy lifestyle behaviours – such as more physical activity, and less sedentary behaviour – is already important at an early age, since these healthy energy balance-related behaviours track into later life, and even into adulthood. The preschool age may be a critical period for preventing overweight and obesity since weight-related behavior patterns and habits are not established yet. Furthermore, early childhood is the critical period for the adiposity rebound. At this age, body adipose tissue reaches a post infancy low point (typically at the age of four to six years). In this abstract, we will focus on preschoolers and elementary school children. Health behaviours may even be important at younger age, but up to now very little is known on these behaviours in toddlers. Physical activity: definition, prevalence and guidelines Physical activity can be defined as “any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure”. Next to the prevention of overweight, participation in sufficient levels of physical activity is also important for the motor, social and cognitive development of children. It has been recommended for elementary school children to engage in at least 60 minutes/day in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Recently, in Australia, Canada and the US, new physical activity guidelines were established specifically for preschool children [Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (2009), Canadian Public Health Association (2007) and Department of Health \{UK\} \{PA\} guidelines (2011)]. These guidelines propose that preschool children should engage in 180 minutes of total physical activity per day, irrespective of intensity. Despite the evidence that sufficient physical activity is beneficiary and healthy, it is shown that considerable numbers of children do not comply with the physical activity recommendations. Based on accelerometer data within the \{ENERGY\} study, the mean level of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day among 10- to 12-year-old children from Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands and Switzerland was 32 minutes for girls and 43 minutes. Only 5% of girls and 17% of boys reached the recommendation according to the cut-points of Treuth. Even in most preschool children, physical activity levels are low. In our Belgian study in four- and five-year-old preschoolers, accelerometer-based data showed that only 15% of the day was spent in total physical activity. Furthermore, Belgian preschoolers engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity for only 34 minutes a day. In the scope of the ToyBox-study, it was found that Belgian preschoolers on average spend 121 ± 47 min on total physical activity and only 9% fulfill the current physical activity recommendation according to the cut-points of Reilly. Sedentary behaviour: definition, prevalence and guidelines Sedentary behaviour can be defined as any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure that is less than or equal to 1.5 \{METs\} (Metabolic Equivalents) while in a sitting or reclining posture (Sedentary Behaviour Research Network, 2012). Such behaviours generally include television viewing, electronic game use, reading, and computer use. For a long time, having a sedentary lifestyle was considered the opposite of being sufficiently physically active, but research has demonstrated that sedentary behaviour and physical activity are two unique behavioural constructs, independently related to various health outcomes, such as overweight and obesity. Many children that are able to attain the recommended physical activity levels still spend a large proportion of time in a sedentary way, suggesting that sedentary behaviour cannot be defined as failure to meet the physical activity guidelines. According to \{UK\} Start Active Stay Active (2011), young children should minimize the amount of time spent being sedentary (restrained or sitting) for extended periods (with the exception of sleeping). While there are many other forms of sedentary behaviour, this behaviour is often performed in the context of screen-based entertainment, particularly in television viewing. This screen-based entertainment has been shown to be associated with some negative health outcomes (e.g., lower bone density, adverse consequences for educational achievement, anti-social and aggressive behaviour) in two- to four-year-old children and it was shown that this behaviour moderately tracks from childhood into later years. Screen-time is frequently used as a proxy marker of overall sedentary behaviour. Consequently, next to the suggestion to limit prolonged periods of sitting, sedentary behaviour guidelines also include specific recommendations for the amount of screen-time per day. Recently developed guidelines on sedentary behaviour recommend children to spend no more than two hours per day on screen-time and to limit sedentary transport, extended sitting time and time spent indoors. Furthermore, recent guidelines recommend that preschool children (one- to five-year-olds) should limit watching television and the use of other electronic media – like computer, \{DVDs\} and other electronic games – to less than one or two hours daily (Australian Department of Health and Ageing 2010, Canadian Sedentary Behavior Guidelines, 2012) or no more than two hours daily (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006). Despite the introduction of these guidelines, children spend a considerable amount of time in sedentary pursuits throughout the day. Recent accelerometer-based data in elementary schoolchildren aged 10–12 years showed that European children spent on average 65% of their waking time in sedentary activities with boys and girls spending on average of 3.5 and 3 hours per day respectively on screen-time behaviours (television and computer time). Even at preschool age sedentary behaviour is very common. Inadequate data exists on the current prevalence of preschool children's levels of sedentary behaviour, and various measurement and analytic issues hamper comparison of findings between studies. However, most studies using objective methods (such as accelerometry) to assess time in sedentary behaviour report that children spend between 50% and 80% of their time being sedentary. Furthermore, parental proxy-reports indicated that Belgian preschoolers spent on average 1.2 hours and 2.3 hours in \{TV\} viewing and computer use on week and weekend days respectively. Similarly, the Australian Health Survey (2011–2012) reported that two- to four-year-olds spent 1.4 hours per day watching TV, \{DVDs\} or playing electronic games, while \{US\} preschoolers (mean age 4.4 years) were exposed to 3.6 hours of screen-based entertainment daily at home. More physical activity and less sitting in children: how? The importance of a socio-ecological approach to health promotion has become widely recognized. According to this approach, health promotion initiatives should not only focus on individual factors, but the broader cultural, social and economic environment of the individual has to be taken into account. For the promotion of healthy behaviours in children, not only the children but also the parents and other caregivers, like day-care personnel and teachers have to be focused on and the home environment as well as the school or day-care environment are important. Interventions should aim at creating an environment supportive of healthy behaviours. On the other hand, strategies should take into account personal factors, like age and social economical status and should consider personal barriers of the children and parents and teachers too. Within several projects (ENERGY, IDEFICS, and ToyBox) [3], the Intervention Mapping protocol has been used as the conceptual framework for developing an intervention. Using the Intervention Mapping protocol has the benefit that the intervention is developed in a systematic, evidence-based and theory-driven manner. Every decision during the development and implementation protocol is well thought-out and carefully considered. In addition, different implementation levels are included in the Intervention Mapping protocol (e.g., individual level, interpersonal level, organisational level), which heightens complexity, but might also raise effectiveness. Based on the Intervention Mapping protocol, matrices have been developed to design interventions to promote more physical activity and less sitting in children. These matrices can be used for future intervention development. Physical activity: some intervention approaches Schools are considered to be one of the preferred intervention environments for increasing daily physical activity in children. Consequently, helping schools to fulfill their physical activity promoting role should be a public health priority, especially since a recent study within the ENERGY-project in 10-to 12-year-olds showed that only a small amount of time at school (5%) was spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity. The Toronto Charter for Physical activity outlines a “whole-school” approach as one of the seven “best investments” for physical activity, which are supported by good evidence of effectiveness and that will have worldwide applicability. A “whole-school” approach to physical activity involves prioritizing regular, highly-active, physical education classes; providing suitable physical environments and resources to support structured and unstructured physical activity throughout the day; supporting walk/cycle to school programmes and enabling all of these actions through supportive school policy and engaging staff, students, parents and the wider community. However, it was found in Belgian schools that after school physical activity programmes and the promotion of active commuting are not widely implemented [4]. Further efforts are needed to convince and help schools to increase parental and pupil involvement and to build a policy on school-community partnerships to provide \{PA\} opportunities for all children. In preschoolers, studies on interventions to promote physical activity are scarce. A review within the ToyBox-study showed that interventions that (1) combined high levels of parental involvement and interactive school-based learning, (2) targeted physical activity and dietary change and (3) included long-term follow-up, appeared most effective to prevent obesity in preschool aged children. It was suggested that interventions should also focus on developing children's and parents perceived competence at making physical activity and dietary changes. Within the ToyBox-study a kindergarten-based intervention with parental involvement was developed [5]. Intervention effects were evaluated on Belgian preschoolers’ objectively measured physical activity. In the total sample, an effect was found on moderate to vigorous physical activity during after school hours. Larger effects were found in sub-groups, namely in preschool boys and in preschoolers from preschools with a high socio-economic status. Based on the ecological model, some studies looked specifically into school environmental factors in relation to children's physical activity. In that regard, we found that young children's physical activity during recess was associated with modifiable playground factors. Furthermore the provision of more play space increased physical activity levels during recess in elementary schoolchildren as well as in preschoolers [6]. However, the provison of markings and play materials was only effective in increasing physical activity levels in elementary schoolchildren and not in preschoolers [7]. The latter emphasizes the age-specific approach and that “one intervention fits all” does not hold. Sedentary behaviour: some intervention approaches Up to now, only limited research has been done on sedentary behaviour in children and only a few interventions to decrease sedentary behaviour have been published. While objective data show high levels of sedentary behavious in young childen, parents and teachers do not perceive this as such. They also do not think high levels of television time are problematic in young children. Consequently, interventions to decrease sedentary behaviour should first raise awareness on this health behaviour. Furthermore, studies consistently report a positive association between parents’ and children's television viewing time and clearly show the effect of parental modelling on childrens’ television viewing behaviour, which highlights the importance of parental involvement in interventions [8]. Up to now, only few interventions focusing on sedentary behaviour have been evaluated. The \{UP4FUN\} intervention did not result in an effect on children's sedentary time [9]. The intervention consisted of 1 or 2 lessons per week during 6 weeks implemented by the class teachers. The researchers stated that sedentary behaviours could have a strong habitual component and are therefore difficult to change, especially in a short intervention period. In a previous studies evaluating back pain prevention efforts in schoolchildren and comparing a traditional school with a moving school, the use of environmental components in the classroom (e.g. standing desks, swiss balls) showed promising effects on sitting posture and sedentary behaviours [10]. This suggests that structural changes in the school environment are a more promising strategy to change sedentary behaviour. Effects of the ToyBox intervention were evaluated in Belgian preschoolers. Some small effects were found on computer time, but no intervention effects were found on objectively measured total sedentary time in the total sample. However, important intervention effects were found in important sub-groups (i.e., girls, in preschoolers of low socio-economic status preschools and in those with the highest levels of total sedentary time at baseline). Conclusion High prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in children, the fact that considerable numbers do not reach the physical activity guidelines and that sedentary behaviour is very common already at young age, advocate the need for effective interventions focusing on more physical activity and less sitting in children. A socio-ecological approach and the involvement of schools and preschools as well as parents are important for interventions to promote more physical activity and less sitting. Some physical activity promotion interventions are found to be effective, but effects are often rather limited and the implementation is often lacking. Therefore, future studies might need to include a more participatory approach during the development of the intervention to increase effectiveness. Further study is also needed to evaluate interventions that promote less prolonged sitting in children. This seems particularly challenging due to the strong habitual component. Interventions including more environmental components seem promising and need to be further explored. "

The management of oxidative stress being important to successful aging, we characterized this process in the aging \{LOU\} rat. Male/female \{LOU\} rats were euthanized at 4, 20, and 29 months. Macrodissected hippocampus, striatum, parietal cortex, cerebellum were assayed for tissue concentrations of glutathione (GSH), gamma-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (γ-GCS), total thiols, protein carbonyls, mRNAs of clusterin and the known protective enzymes thioredoxine-1 (TRX-1), glutaredoxine-1 (GLRX-1), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1). Brain levels of GSH, γ-GCS, total thiols remained constant with age, except for \{GSH\} and γ-GCS which decreases in females. Clusterin, TRX-1, GLRX-1, SOD-1 mRNA levels were maintained or increased in the hippocampus with age. Age-dependency of the markers differed between sexes, with SOD-1 and TRX-1 decreases out of hippocampus in females. Since antioxidants were reported to decrease with age in the brain of Wistar rats, maintenance of \{GSH\} levels and of protective enzymes mRNA levels in the \{LOU\} rat brain could contribute to the preservation of cognitive functions in old age. Altogether, the successful aging of \{LOU\} rats may, at least in part, involve the conservation of functional antioxidant mechanisms in the brain, supporting the oxidative stress theory of aging. "

Thus far, there is no curative treatment for this devastating condition, thereby creating significant social and medical burdens. \{AD\} is characterized by progressive cognitive decline along with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and psychosis. Depression is a common psychiatric disorder affecting individuals across the life span. Although the “monoamine hypothesis” of depression has long been proposed, the pathologies and mechanisms for depressive disorders remain only partially understood. Pharmacotherapies targeting the monoaminergic pathways have been the mainstay in treating depression. Additional therapeutic approaches focusing other pathological mechanisms of depression are currently being explored. Interestingly, a number of proposed mechanisms for depression appear to be similar to those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. For example, diminishing neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammation observed in depression are found to be associated with the development of AD. This article first provides a concise review of \{AD\} and depression, then discusses the putative links between the two neuropsychiatric conditions. "

However, a more detailed analysis disclosed important differences between \{DAT\} and healthy elderly. Compared to healthy controls, \{DAT\} patients shifted more frequently between safe and risky alternatives and showed less consistent response patterns. Frequent changes between strategies indicate that decisions were taken randomly, that no advantageous strategy was established and that no consistent response pattern was developed over time. As regards performance changes over the task, healthy participants had a stronger tendency towards safe and advantageous responses than \{DAT\} patients. While healthy controls showed learning as the task proceeded, \{DAT\} patients did not adapt their strategies. The proportion of “consistently safe responders” was significantly higher in the control group than in the \{DAT\} group. Analysis of reaction times indicated that differences in response behaviour were not due to fast and impulsive decision taking in the \{DAT\} group. \{DAT\} patients’ response pattern may be attributed to deficits in learning and in executive functions. The frequency of changes between safe and risky choices proved to be a fair predictor for the distinction between mild \{DAT\} and healthy aging. "

Altered resting state oscillatory brain activity may reflect underlying neuropathological changes. The present study using magneto encephalography (MEG) was set up to study differences in the pattern of resting state oscillatory brain activity in groups of demented and non-demented \{PD\} patients and healthy, elderly controls. Methods The pattern of \{MEG\} background oscillatory activity was studied in 13 demented \{PD\} patients, 13 non-demented \{PD\} patients and 13 healthy controls. Whole head \{MEG\} recordings were obtained in the morning in an eyes closed and an eyes open, resting state condition. Relative spectral power was calculated using Fast Fourier Transformation in δ, θ, α, β and γ frequency bands. Results In the non-demented \{PD\} patients, relative θ power was diffusely increased and β power concomitantly decreased relative to controls. γ Power was decreased in central and parietal channels. In the demented \{PD\} patients, a diffuse increase in relative δ and to lesser extent θ power and a decrease in relative α, β and to lesser extent γ power were found in comparison to the non-demented \{PD\} group. In addition, reactivity to eye opening was much reduced in the demented \{PD\} group. Conclusions Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a slowing of resting state brain activity involving θ, β and γ frequency bands. Dementia in \{PD\} is associated with a further slowing of resting state brain activity, additionally involving δ and α bands, as well as a reduction in reactivity to eye-opening. Significance The differential patterns of slowing of resting state brain activity in demented and non-demented \{PD\} patients suggests that, in conjunction with a progression of the pathological changes already present in non-demented patients, additional mechanisms are involved in the development of dementia in PD.

abstract = "Suicide is a major public health concern, especially for older adults, who have higher rates of completed suicide than any other age group in most countries of the world. However, understanding suicidal behaviour remains a challenging task particularly among the elders who have been poorly studied. Decision making has been recently found to be altered in suicide attempters under 65.To test wether decision making would be a neuropsychological trait of vulnerability to suicidal behaviours, the authors used the Iowa Gambling Task to investigate normothymic non demented elders with a history of suicidal behaviour (N = 35) and compared it to decision making in non suicide attempters with a past history of depression (N = 52) and comparison subjects (N = 43). The data also were compared to those of similar groups of younger normothymic subjects. Moreover, the old suicidal patients were assessed according to the age at the onset of suicidal behaviour (before or after 60).Old suicide attempters did not significantly differ from the other aged groups and according to the age of first suicidal behaviour. Old suicide attempters presented better performances than that of younger suicidal patients.Vulnerability to suicidal behaviour in older people may proceed from cognitive processes which are different from the ones involved in suicidal vulnerability of younger subjects. These results are preliminary and further studies are needed to explore vulnerability cognitive patterns to suicide among elders. "

We combined z scores from multiple biomarkers to describe haematopoiesis, inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism, liver function, renal function, and cellular senescence domains. In Cox proportional hazard models, inflammation predicted all-cause mortality with hazard ratios (95% CI) 1.89 (1.21 to 2.95) and 1.36 (1.05 to 1.78) in the very old and (semi-)supercentenarians, respectively. In linear forward stepwise models, inflammation predicted capability (10.8% variance explained) and cognition (8.6% variance explained) in (semi-)supercentenarians better than chronologic age or gender. The inflammation score was also lower in centenarian offspring compared to age-matched controls with Δ (95% CI) = − 0.795 (− 1.436 to − 0.154). Centenarians and their offspring were able to maintain long telomeres, but telomere length was not a predictor of successful ageing in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians. We conclude that inflammation is an important malleable driver of ageing up to extreme old age in humans. "

Recent studies have demonstrated that cognitive impairments affect gait stability in the elderly (i.e., their capacity for smoothing upper body accelerations during walking) but little attention has been paid to young adults with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of this study was to examine upright stability in young adults with intellectual disabilities during walking, running, and dual-task running (playing soccer). To this aim a wearable trunk-mounted device that permits on-field assessment was used to quantify trunk acceleration of 18 male teenagers with intellectual disabilities (IDG) and 7 mental-age-matched healthy children (HCG) who participated in the same soccer program. We did not find any significant difference during walking in terms of speed, whereas speed differences were found during running (p = .001). Upper body accelerations were altered in a pathology-specific manner during the dual task: the performance of subjects with autistic disorders was compromised while running and controlling the ball with the feet. Differences in upright locomotor patterns between \{IDG\} and \{HCG\} emerged during more demanding motor tasks in terms of a loss in the capacity of smoothing accelerations at the trunk level. "

Here we tested the hypothesis that these two variables could be related. Methods We investigated \{VMR\} and coherence of resting state \{EEG\} rhythms in nine normal elderly (Nold) and in 10 amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Resting state eyes-closed \{EEG\} data were recorded at baseline pre-CO2 (ambient air, 2 min), during 7% CO2/air mixture inhalation (hypercapnia, 90 s) and post-CO2 (ambient air, 2 min) conditions. Simultaneous frontal bilateral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was performed to assess \{VMR\} by cortical oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin concentration changes. \{EEG\} coherence across all electrodes was computed at delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha 1 (8–10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5–13 Hz), beta 1 (13–20 Hz), beta 2 (20–30 Hz) and gamma (30–40 Hz) bands. Results In Nold subjects, ‘total coherence’ of \{EEG\} across all frequency bands and electrode pairs decreased during hypercapnia, with full recovery during post-CO2. Total coherence resulted lower in pre-CO2 and post-CO2 and presented poor reactivity during \{CO2\} inhalation in \{MCI\} patients compared with Nold subjects. Hypercapnia increased oxy-haemoglobin and decreased deoxy-haemoglobin concentrations in both groups. Furthermore, the extent of changes in these variables during \{CO2\} challenge was correlated with the \{EEG\} coherence, as a reflection of neurovascular coupling. Conclusions Hypercapnia induced normal frontal \{VMR\} that was detected by \{NIRS\} in both Nold and amnesic \{MCI\} groups, while it produced a reactivity of global functional coupling of resting state \{EEG\} rhythms only in the Nold group. Significance In amnesic \{MCI\} patients, global \{EEG\} functional coupling is basically low in amplitude and does not react to hypercapnia. "

Language and speech abnormalities are also present in bipolar disorder, especially in verbal fluency and verbal memory. However, there is a lack of studies in the literature investigating different levels of linguistic processing (phonological, syntactical, and semantic) in a single cohort of euthymic bipolar patients. Based on previous findings of pervasive language impairment in euthymic elderly bipolar patients, the aim of this study was to comprise a more thorough investigation on the subject. Methods We studied 19 euthymic bipolar patients aged 60 and above, and 20 cognitively healthy subjects using the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD) and the Test for Reception of Grammar Version 2 (TROG-2) in order to assess the phonological, syntactic, and semantic domains of language. Results Bipolar patients performed poorer than controls in Linguistic Expression (p=0.011), in Linguistic Comprehension (Following Commands; p=0.025 and Reading Comprehension of Sentences; p=0.007), and in the TROG-2 (p=0.006). Limitations The small sample comprising only elderly patients; the lack of statistical power to analyze the potential effect of individual medications on the cognitive performance. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that linguistic impairment is present in euthymic bipolar patients, affecting mostly syntactic and lexical–semantic abilities, both in comprehension and production of language. These deficits are interrelated with other cognitive skills also known to be affected in bipolar disorder, such as executive functions and episodic memory. "

New method We developed a procedure of synchronizing an electronic walkway (GAITRite, \{CIR\} Systems Inc.) with a multi-channel, wireless EEG-system (BrainAmp, Brainproducts). To assess the practicability of our procedure we performed a proof of concept measurement involving concurrently recording gait pattern and brain electrical activity in two elderly and two young participants. This measurement enabled us to assess the synchronization of the two data sets under realistic conditions. Results Only carrying a filled water glass reduced gait regularity in the elderly. In the young gait regularity was constant across all tasks. This concurs with previous findings reporting a task specific influence on gait. Carrying a full water glass also led to an increase in the power of the \{EEG\} gamma-band oscillations in frontal cortex of the elderly, but led to a decrease in the young participants. Carrying a full glass increased activity in frontal cortex of the elderly but decreased it in the young participants. Comparison with existing methods At present, concurrent recording of gait pattern and electrical brain activity requires participants to walk on a treadmill. Our procedure enables these measurements to be made under natural walking conditions. This allows measurements of brain activity during walking in special needs groups such as children, the elderly or the infirm under near natural conditions. Conclusions Our procedure for synchronizing \{EEG\} and gait proved simple, reliable and generated data of high-quality. "

The control subjects were 11 healthy elderly people (mean age: 70.5±6.5 years). In patients, the total score on the selective reminding test (SRT) was used as an index of memory function. Counts from a hippocampal and a temporoparietal region of interest in each hemisphere were referred to the average thalamic counts. To optimize \{SPECT\} images, we used conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction and a new iterative method of conjugate gradients (CG), which takes into account the geometrical and physical characteristics of the gamma-camera. Hippocampal perfusion in the two hemispheres was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects, regardless of which reconstruction method was used, and correlated with the \{MMSE\} score. The correlation between hippocampal perfusion and the \{SRT\} score was significantly (bootstrap procedure) higher with the \{CG\} method than with the \{FBP\} method (CG: r=0.52 and 0.54; FBP: r=0.39 and 0.47, for the right and left hemisphere, respectively). These results show hippocampal hypoperfusion in patients with mild AD, a correlation between hippocampal perfusion and the severity of cognitive impairment, and enhanced identification of these subtle perfusional changes with the use of an alternative image-reconstruction method that improves the spatial resolution of \{SPECT\} images.

We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics.

Setting Acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Patients and Participants Nineteen hospitalized patients without delirium who were screened for pre-existing cerebral and psychiatric illness, dementia, and dependency in basic self-care skills before hospitalization. Eighteen community-dwelling persons who were not different in terms of age and education served as the control group. Methods Participants completed 10 commonly used neuropsychological tests of executive, language, and memory functions. Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance. Main Outcome Measurements Raw scores on the 10 neuropsychological tests. Results Hospitalized patients performed significantly worse on 9 of 10 tests than community-dwelling participants. Older hospitalized participants had significantly greater cognitive impairment than younger hospitalized participants, which suggested increased susceptibility to effects of hospitalization on cognition. Conclusions Patients hospitalized without brain injury, and especially elderly patients, should be carefully monitored for cognitive deficits that may affect posthospitalization quality of living. Further research is needed to determine whether the cognitive deficits in such patients persist after discharge and affect functional independence, and to identify mechanisms for the deficits. Furthermore, the use of hospitalized participants without brain injury as control subjects in neuropsychological studies of brain injury should be balanced with an additional comparison group of matched, neurologically healthy, normal subjects who live in the community to control for cognitive impairments that are associated with acute hospitalization.

At present we know of &gt;300 enzymes and &gt;1000 transcription factors that require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells participate in signaling events. Zinc has been very successfully used as a therapeutic modality for the management of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry type of macular degeneration. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Zinc supplementation in the elderly results in decreased incidence of infections, decreased oxidative stress and decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines. "

Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level. Results We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates. "

In 2001, it was estimated that there were almost 5 million Europeans suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and this figure has been projected to almost double by 2040. About 40% of people over 85 suffer from AD, and another 10% from Parkinson’s disease (PD). The majority of \{AD\} and \{PD\} cases are of sporadic origin and environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology. Epidemiological research identified airborne particulate matter (PM) as one of the environmental factors potentially involved in \{AD\} and \{PD\} pathogenesis. Also, cumulating evidence demonstrates that the smallest sizes of the inhalable fraction of ambient particulate matter, also referred to as ultrafine particulate matter or nano-sized particles, are capable of inducing effects beyond the respiratory system. Translocation of very small particles via the olfactory epithelium in the nose or via uptake into the circulation has been demonstrated through experimental rodent studies with engineered nanoparticles. Outdoor air pollution has been linked to several health effects including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation that may ultimately result in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. This review aims to evaluate the relationship between exposure to inhaled ambient particles and neurodegeneration. "

Since changes in executive function (EF) are contingent upon age and may compromise assessment accuracy, psychiatric patients and normal controls were compared in terms of cognitive decline rates. \{EF\} is measured with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), that has adapted several standard cognitive tests for computerized administration and scoring. Objectives Specification of the relation between psychopathology, cognition and aging. Aims Cross sectional examination of the age related executive changes in a sample of adults with a history of psychiatric illness using the CANTAB. Methods A total of 406 patients (18-72 years), diagnosed with (a) affective disorders (N=153), (b) substance related disorders (N=112), (c) personality disorders (N=82), or (d) pervasive developmental disorders (N=59), completed \{CANTAB\} executive function tests of working memory (SWM), strategic planning (SOC) and set shifting (IED). Test performances were compared with those of 52 healthy adults. Results Both in the patient groups and the healthy participants, similar rates of executive decline were found. Conclusions The present research indicates that the decline of executive skills in populations with psychiatric conditions does not exceed the age related executive changes typically seen in healthy aging adults. Still, compared with the latter, patients seem to earlier reach the critical threshold at which functional deficits emerge, notwithstanding the comparable decline rates. Understanding aging and its interaction with cognition in later life may refine treatment design for the elderly patient. "

Twenty-three cognitively unimpaired older adults were randomly assigned to receive memory training or standard outpatient care only. Both groups were cognitively assessed by the same protocol, and the experimental group (EG) underwent a four-session memory training intervention. Pre- and post-test measures included prose and list recall, WAIS-III digit symbol, strategy use measures and platelet \{PLA2\} group activity. After cognitive training, patients in the \{EG\} group had significant increase in cytosolic, calcium-dependent \{PLA2\} (cPLA2), extracellular (or secreted), calcium-dependent \{PLA2\} (sPLA2), total platelet \{PLA2\} activity, and significant decrease in platelet calcium-independent \{PLA2\} (iPLA2) activity.

Surveys suggest that over 30% of all prescriptions written for \{HRT\} are never filled due to these concerns and recent findings from Woman’s Health Initiative trials have only added to these trepidations. Selective brain delivery of estrogens, in general, and estradiol, in particular, may address these items.

Owing to the very poor water solubility and limited stability of these derivatives, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin has proved to be enabling excipients in the development of these drug candidates. Various preclinical evaluations have demonstrated the organ-targeting potential of an estradiol-chemical delivery systems (E2-CDS) and therefore its potential usefulness as a therapeutic adjunct in certain subpopulations of menopausal women including those at risk to breast carcinomas. A very exciting potential use of the E2-CDS is in neurodegenerative diseases.

abstract = "Without medical progress, dementing diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease will become one of the main causes of disability. Preventing or delaying them has thus become a real challenge for biomedical research. Steroids offer interesting therapeutical opportunities for promoting successful aging because of their pleiotropic effects in the nervous system: they regulate main neurotransmitter systems, promote the viability of neurons, play an important role in myelination and influence cognitive processes, in particular learning and memory. Preclinical research has provided evidence that the normally aging nervous system maintains some capacity for regeneration and that age-dependent changes in the nervous system and cognitive dysfunctions can be reversed to some extent by the administration of steroids. The aging nervous system also remains sensitive to the neuroprotective effects of steroids. In contrast to the large number of studies documenting beneficial effects of steroids on the nervous system in young and aged animals, the results from hormone replacement studies in the elderly are so far not conclusive. There is also little information concerning changes of steroid levels in the aging human brain. As steroids present in nervous tissues originate from the endocrine glands (steroid hormones) and from local synthesis (neurosteroids), changes in blood levels of steroids with age do not necessarily reflect changes in their brain levels. There is indeed strong evidence that neurosteroids are also synthesized in human brain and peripheral nerves. The development of a very sensitive and precise method for the analysis of steroids by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) offers new possibilities for the study of neurosteroids. The concentrations of a range of neurosteroids have recently been measured in various brain regions of aged Alzheimer’s disease patients and aged non-demented controls by GC/MS, providing reference values. In Alzheimer’s patients, there was a general trend toward lower levels of neurosteroids in different brain regions, and neurosteroid levels were negatively correlated with two biochemical markers of Alzheimer’s disease, the phosphorylated tau protein and the β-amyloid peptides. The metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone has also been analyzed for the first time in the aging brain from Alzheimer patients and non-demented controls. The conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to Δ5-androstene-3β,17β-diol and to 7α-OH-dehydroepiandrosterone occurred in frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and striatum of both Alzheimer’s patients and controls. The formation of these metabolites within distinct brain regions negatively correlated with the density of β-amyloid deposits. "

The authors then define routinization then present a set of researches showing that routine can be a marker of vulnerabilities in psychological, social, neuropsychological and cognitive areas. Based on this, the authors then try to show that routinized behaviours are classically observed in a variety of clinical expressions, particularly at the level of psychotic troubles (ex. schizophrenia), of pervasive developmental disorders, of anxious and mood troubles. All this allows the authors to question the outcome of these observations, more particularly their utility in the field of clinical practice, taking for example the functions of routinization in weakened elderly and autistic persons. The authors conclude in inviting clinicians to pay more interest to routinized behaviours and to begin research to best define what is due to a banal and adaptable routinization and what is due to a process leading a subject to a general impoverishment of his resources in the short or long term.

abstract = "If one is to understand the current status and climate of the U.S. medical system, it is essential to place it in the appropriate historical perspective. One must look at how the medical system evolved into the current situation, what the characteristics of that situation are, and what can be expected in the years to come. During the first half of the twentieth century, the practice of medicine was simple and straightforward. Patients had direct relationships with physicians and had ultimate choice in whom to see. Most physicians were in solo practice and received payments from patients on rendering service. Fees were relatively small, and there were frequent instances in which payments could not be made and services were provided in exchange for goods, future payments, and, not infrequently, the mere promise of payments that never materialized. Nevertheless, most physicians survived economically and enjoyed a high regard in their communities. At the same time, the public's expectations of what medical care could provide was modest. Physicians were viewed as caring individuals rather than miracle workers. They practiced autonomously and made decisions without the benefit of complex testing and procedures. In general, medical care was sought only for serious illness. Hospitals existed in urban settings and served large population areas. After World War \{II\} and up to 1965, changes began occurring in the public's attitude toward medical care. With significant developments in medical technology; developments in drugs, most notably antibiotics; and the experience gained in treating casualties during the war, Americans sought and soon demanded more from their physicians, with growing expectations for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, costs began to increase. Medical care was not only available to the rich, but also became regarded as a right to all. Health insurance was developed by hospital organizations and the medical profession. Patients paid only a portion of their bill, and the ever-increasing demand for services combined with the growth in payments by third parties allowed for progressive increase in prices. 7 During this era, there was a large migration to the suburbs with patients no longer wanting to travel long distances to receive medical and hospital care. A result was the growth of community hospitals financed by the expanding insurance payments supported by ever-increasing premiums, resulting in double digit inflation within the health sector. Before President Clinton's efforts at health care reform, President Truman was an earnest champion of reform to stem the tide of the “runaway” health care costs of the late 1940s, during which health care accounted for less than 4% of the gross domestic product. Meanwhile, unions and employers became involved in underwriting some of the costs of health insurance premiums, and health care first became a significant issue at the bargaining table. With the absence of checks on supply and demand, however, costs continued to soar. In 1965, Medicare was created. Health care was deemed a right for the elderly, the poor, and the disabled, and government was called on to provide the financing. Suddenly, even those unable to afford private insurance were now covered. Technology flourished fostered by the perception and demand of the public that the more physicians could do, the better they would be. To a large extent, that was true. Between 1965 and the early 1980s, dramatic technologic advances were made in the practice of surgery and noninvasive imaging such as endoscopy, ultrasound, and the early development of computed tomography scanning. These technologies were expensive and were, in large part, financed by the government and insurance industry. The concept of cost-based reimbursement flourished so that the more physicians charged, the more they were paid. Physicians were recruited by hospitals to bring and refer their patients. The more the physicians did and the longer the length of hospital stay, the greater the payment. Because the increased cost did not have a direct impact on the patients, there was little resistance to this philosophy. The new technologies led to a dramatic shift in the physician population. There was a large increase in specialists who could use and provide the new types of technology patients and hospitals desired. Eventually the “me too” philosophy of hospitals led to an oversupply of beds and unnecessary duplication of services. Business ultimately called a halt to this runaway growth. At a time when medical care was approaching 9% to 10% of the gross domestic product, industry, which was paying for much of the health care premiums, saw those costs threatening pretax profits to the extent that insolvency was threatened for some of the largest employers. In 1965, Chrysler Corporation reported spending 8% of pretax profits for health care benefits for their employees. This figure rose to 26% by 1982 with projections of up to 65%% by 1995 (M Brotman, personal communication). This drain on profits had to be curtailed and eventually led to the current managed care era beginning in the early 1980s. Despite these efforts, health care's growth as a portion of the gross domestic product continued to increase to 13.7% in 1994. The rate of growth, however, finally slowed from 0.5% per year to less than 0.1%% in 1994. 9 With the advent of the 1980s, constraints were initiated on hospitals and physicians. Initially, noneconomic controls appeared, such as peer review and utilization management. The early efforts to contain costs led to the origination of the first health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in California, soon to be followed by more pervasive development in other parts of the United States, such as Minneapolis. Economic constraints on hospitals were led by the federal government's development of prospective payment by diagnostically related groups. Suddenly, hospitals were no longer paid based on costs but received a relatively fixed payment commensurate with the patient's diagnosis regardless of services provided. Length of stay became a burden. The longer patients remained hospitalized, the more services provided and the greater the potential loss. Because this initial new payment paradigm did not affect physicians, there was an obvious divergence of goals between hospitals and physicians in the approach to patient care resulting in growing acrimony, which to some extent exists even today. Eventually, physicians suffered the same restrictions on reimbursement. Medicare instituted the resource-based relative value scale replacing payment based on usual and customary reimbursement. This change did reduce the dramatic discrepancies in payments for procedural versus cognitive skills but resulted in the reduction of all levels of reimbursement on what many would charge are unfair and erroneous principles. This was rapidly followed by the dramatic curtailment of payments from private insurance carriers, the rapid reduction and practical demise of the fee-for-service form of payment, and the development and growth of alternate payment strategies that now constitute the economic cornerstone of medical practice in the United States. At the same time, the Health Care Financing Administration initiated the concept of volume performance standards that placed inherent stopgaps on the overall payment for specific services believed to be in excess of predetermined quotas based on previous experience. This change resulted in further reductions in per capita payment for such services so as to remain budget neutral. With this background, the stage was set for the dramatic changes in the marketplace that now exist in medical care. "

Objective The purpose of this article is to review what is known about: (1) the prevalence and nature of ageist stereotypes; (2) the varied ways in which ageist stereotypes are harmful to health, functioning, and well-being; and (3) strategies for effective communication with older adults around lifestyle issues, with particular emphasis on physical activity. Method This article reviews literature on current myths and reality of aging in the context of designing health promotion programs for older adults. Strategies for combating ageist stereotypes are based on a multilevel view of determinants of health and aging. Conclusions Ageist stereotypes are pervasive in U.S. society and harmful to older adults' psychological well-being, physical and cognitive functioning, and survival. Concrete strategies for communicating with older adults can increase the effectiveness of health promotion programs. Strategies for combating ageism and creating a healthier society must address all segments of society, and include educational and media campaigns, an expansion of current research foci, greater sensitivity from care providers, more opportunities for intergenerational linkages, the design of productive roles for older adults, a retrofit of the built environment, and intensified and collaborative action from both the public and private sectors.
