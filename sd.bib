This study undertakes a systematic literature review of empirical studies on various types of technologies and their effectiveness in alleviating social isolation among seniors. Relevant electronic databases were searched and through 6886 initial set of studies published from 2000 to 2015 we have found eight different technologies that have been applied to alleviate social isolation, namely, general ICT, video game, robotics, personal reminder information and social management system, asynchronous peer support chat room, social network sites, Telecare and 3D virtual environment. We further evaluated the effectiveness of the technologies with social isolation among seniors. Findings show that technologies can be used to reduce social isolation among seniors. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies. "

Studies have been conducted to introduce an assistive technology to support seniors and to investigate the acceptance of these assistive technologies; however, research illustrating the effectiveness of assistive technologies is scant. Method This study undertakes a systematic literature review of ScienceDirect, PubMed, ProQuest and \{IEEE\} Explore databases to investigate current empirical studies on the assistive technologies applied in aged care. Our systematic review of an initial set of 2035 studies published from 2000 to 2014 examines the role of assistive technologies in seniors’ daily lives, from enhancements in their mobility to improvements in the social connectedness and decreases in readmission to hospitals. Results This study found eight key issues in aged care that have been targeted by researchers from different disciplines (e.g., ICT, health and social science), namely, dependent living, fall risk, chronic disease, dementia, social isolation, depression, poor well-being, and poor medication management. This paper also identified the assistive technologies that have been proposed to overcome those problems, and we categorised these assistive technologies into six clusters, namely, general ICT, robotics, telemedicine, sensor technology, medication management applications, and video games. In addition, we analyzed the effectiveness of the identified technologies and noted that some technologies can change and enhance seniors’ daily lives and relieve their problems. Our analysis showed a significant growth in the number of publications in this area in the past few years. It also showed that most of the studies in this area have been conducted in North America. Conclusion Assistive technologies are a reality and can be applied to improve quality of life, especially among older age groups. This study identified various assistive technologies proposed by \{ICT\} researchers to assist the elderly. We also identified the effectiveness of the proposed technologies. This review shows that, although assistive technologies have been positively evaluated, more studies are needed regarding the outcome and effectiveness of these technologies. "

Methodology The study included 72 retired persons distributed into three groups: Group \{G1\} (participants in Senior University programs), \{G2\} (participants in a memory training program), and \{G3\} (table games players). The measurements applied include the Clock Test, registering daily activities, and several cognitive tests. Results The analysis of variance and post hoc comparisons were performed. \{G1\} and \{G2\} groups gave more precise details on the distribution of time, and they both practice more cognitive activities than G3, which prefers social activities. \{G1\} practiced “active rest”, as opposed to passive rest by \{G2\} and G3, which was mainly watching \{TV\} or sleeping siesta. Cognitive measurements are significantly better in \{G1\} than in any other group, while the results of \{G2\} were significantly higher than G3. Conclusions The type of leisure activities is positive and significantly related to a richer and more intense planning of non-structured time and with a better cognitive level. "

Although a few recent studies have evaluated their efficacy, there is currently no in-depth description and discussion of different game technologies, physical functions targeted, and safety issues related to older adults playing exergames. Objectives This integrative review provides an overview of the technologies and games used, progression, safety measurements and associated adverse events, adherence to exergaming, outcome measures used, and their effect on physical function. Methods: We undertook systematic searches of \{SCOPUS\} and PubMed databases. Key search terms included “game”, “exercise”, and “aged”, and were adapted to each database. To be included, studies had to involve older adults aged 65 years or above, have a pre-post training or intervention design, include ICT-implemented games with weight-bearing exercises, and have outcome measures that included physical activity variables and/or clinical tests of physical function. Results Sixty studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The studies had a broad range of aims and intervention designs and mostly focused on community-dwelling healthy older adults. The majority of the studies used commercially available gaming technologies that targeted a number of different physical functions. Most studies reported that they had used some form of safety measure during intervention. None of the studies reported serious adverse events. However, only 21 studies (35%) reported on whether adverse events occurred. Twenty-four studies reported on adherence, but only seven studies (12%) compared adherence to exergaming with other forms of exercise. Clinical measures of balance were the most frequently used outcome measures. \{PEDro\} scores indicated that most studies had several methodological problems, with only 4 studies fulfilling 6 or more criteria out of 10. Several studies found positive effects of exergaming on balance and gait, while none reported negative effects. Conclusion Exergames show promise as an intervention to improve physical function in older adults, with few reported adverse events. As there is large variability between studies in terms of intervention protocols and outcome measures, as well as several methodological limitations, recommendations for both practice and further research are provided in order to successfully establish exergames as an exercise and rehabilitation tool for older adults.

It questions also the Silver economy, whose purpose is to build an economical development resulting from the virtuous circle which articulates elders needs for autonomy, the ageing challenges, industrial products, public and private stakeholders, family and professional caregivers, and need for a sustainable development. This reflection will then lead to the core of the ethical question of the meaning and the roles of technology for health and care. Especially, it will suggest a way to collectively build these meaning and roles; this way is in the opposite course of the techno-hubris, and of the economical, ecological, demographical and political disorders.

This paper investigates the gameplay intentions of older people based on data collected from 534 elderly respondents. An Extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed to tailor to the characteristics of elderly users to explore and examine the impact of potential factors on the gameplay intentions of the elderly. The results revealed the predicting power of game narrative, the social interaction and physical condition of the elderly, and the moderating effects of age, gender and previous experience on older people's gameplay intention. Implications were derived for the design of novel digital games that could foster physical activity, social interaction and entertainment for older people, especially for those who live alone. "

abstract = "Abstract Despite the Netherlands’ position as a premier cycling country (mainly due to its high cycling mode share), there is scarce insight into the variations of bicycle use between different spatial and social contexts as well as changes and trends over time. This gap severely limits the understanding of the context-specific aspects of cycling trends and hinders the development of effective policies to promote cycling. In order to fill this gap, this paper explores the spatial and social differentiation of cycling patterns and trends in the Netherlands. First, an overview of the known spatial and social drivers of mobility behaviour in general, and of cycling behaviour in particular, is provided. Next, these insights are used to structure the analysis of data from the Dutch National Travel Survey (NTS). Mobility diaries allowed us to distinguish trends in mobility behaviour across different spatial contexts and social groups. Our findings revealed three important spatial and social differences in cycling patterns and trends. First, the spatial redistribution of the population towards urban areas (‘re-urbanisation’) has led to increasing aggregated cycling volumes in urban areas, and falling rates in rural areas. Second, the general mode share of cycling is mainly sensitive to changes in the composition of the population, especially elderly persons (higher rates) and immigrants (lower rates). Third, although per capita changes are minor, cycling shares among young adults living in urban areas and elderly baby boomers are growing. The results emphasizes the need for a differentiated approach to promoting cycling and developing policies that can respond to location- and group-specific threats and opportunities. An awareness of these spatial- and social differences is especially important when cycling is used as policy intervention for public health; some groups and places are likely to profit, while others might remain immune. Additional research is needed to further clarify the drivers behind the observed trends and to fine-tune the intervention strategies. "

The identification of specific biological targets is therefore crucial to developing pharmacological interventions against age-related muscle wasting. The present work reports promising preliminary data on the association between alterations of myocyte quality control (MQC) signaling and sarcopenia in old patients with hip fracture. Methods Twenty-five elderly hip-fractured patients (20 women and 5 men; mean age 84.9 ± 1.65 years) were enrolled as part of the Sarcopenia in \{HIp\} FracTure (SHIFT) study. Intraoperative biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained and assayed for the expression of a set of \{MQC\} signaling proteins. The presence of sarcopenia was established according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) criteria, with bioelectrical impedance analysis used for fat-free mass estimation. Results Sarcopenia was identified in 10 patients (40%). Protein expression of the mitochondrial fusion factor mitofusin (Mfn) 2 and the autophagy mediator microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) was significantly lower in patients with sarcopenia compared with non-sarcopenic controls. No differences between groups were observed for Mfn1, optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1), fission protein 1 (Fis1), and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? coactivator-1a (PGC-1a). Conclusion Data from this exploratory study show that a reduced expression of the mitochondrial fusion factor Mfn2 and the autophagy mediator \{LC3B\} is associated with sarcopenia in old hip-fractured patients. Future larger-scale studies are needed to corroborate these preliminary findings and determine whether \{MQC\} pathways may be targeted to improve muscle health and promote functional recovery in old patients with hip fracture.

With an increasing longevity and the absence of a cure, \{AD\} has become not only a major health problem but also a heavy social and economic burden worldwide. In addition to the presence of abundant intra- and extra-cellular neurotoxic amyloid ß (Aß) peptides, which form the amyloid plaques, and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, the main component of neurofibrillary tangles, consistent evidence indicates that the \{AD\} brain is characterized by extensive neuroinflammatory processes. The 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) is a pro-inflammatory enzymatic pathway widely distributed within the central nervous system and is up-regulated in AD. In the last five years our group has been involved in unraveling the neurobiology of this protein and investigating its relationship with cellular and molecular events of functional importance in \{AD\} pathogenesis. By using a combination of in vitro and in vivo experimental tools and implementing genetic as well as pharmacological approaches today we know that 5LO is likely an endogenous regulator of Aß formation via the modulation of the ?-secretase complex, and tau metabolism by modulating its phosphorylation state at specific epitopes via the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk-5). In addition, 5LO influences synaptic function and integrity and by doing so significantly affects learning and memory in the Tg2576 and 3xTg \{AD\} transgenic mouse models. Taken together our data establish this protein as a pleiotropic contributor to the development of the full spectrum of the AD-like phenotype in these mouse models of the disease, making it a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of \{AD\} in humans.

abstract = "AbstractAim RGB-D cameras (Red Green Blue + Depth) are widely employed in exergames designed to physically stimulate elderly people. Nevertheless, the intensity of the physical activity reached with the existing solutions is rarely sufficient to obtain a real impact on the physical fitness and thus on the health status of this population. In this context, a Point Cloud Based System (PCBS) has been developed to interface ordinary motorized treadmills with exergames through a simple RGB-D camera, to induce players to perform physical activities at higher intensities. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of \{PCBS\} to measure the walking speed of a subject on a standard motorized treadmill based on the image streams of an RGB-D camera. Methods 36 participants performed three 10 min walking exercises, divided in 5 blocks of 2 min at the following constant ordered speeds: 0.42, 0.69, 0.97, 1.25 and 1.53 m s-1. The measured walking speeds are compared to those obtained through a Marker Based Control System (MBCS). Results Results showed a high system accuracy (bias: 0.013 ± 0.015 m s-1), a good reliability (ICC = 0.63–0.91) and a low variability (SEM = 1–5%; \{MD\} = 2.7–14%). Discussion Accuracy and reliability of \{PCBS\} are consistent with those obtained in similar existing systems measuring gait parameters. Conclusion Within the context of the development of exergames, \{PCBS\} may be combined with exergames to perform physical activities at sufficiently high intensities in the elderly population, in order to improve their physical health and possibly prevent/delay cognitive impairment.

abstract = "Abstract The abuse of benzodiazepine (BZP) and Z drugs has become, due to the tolerance and dependence they produce, a serious public health problem. Thirty years ago, we demonstrated in experimental animals the interaction of melatonin with central \{BZD\} receptors, and in 1997 we published the first series of elderly patients who reduced \{BZP\} consumption after melatonin treatment. Almost every single neuron in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the central pacemaker of the circadian system, contains ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and many results in animals point out to a melatonin interaction with GABA-containing neurons. In addition, central-type \{BZD\} antagonism, that obliterates \{GABAA\} receptor function, blunted most behavioral effects of melatonin including sleep. Melatonin is involved in the regulation of human sleep. This is supported by the temporal relationship between the rise of plasma melatonin levels and sleep propensity as well as by the sleep-promoting effects of exogenously administered melatonin. Both meta-analyses and consensus agreements give support to the therapeutic use of melatonin in sleep disorders. This action is attributed to \{MT1\} and \{MT2\} melatoninergic receptors localized in the SCN, as well as in other brain areas. This review discusses available data on the efficacy of melatonin to curtail chronic BZD/Z drug use in insomnia patients. A major advantage is that melatonin has a very safe profile, it is usually remarkably well tolerated and, in some studies, it has been administered to patients at very large doses and for long periods of time, without any potentiality of abuse. Further studies on this application of melatonin are warranted. "

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an exercise program with a \{SG\} developed for the rehabilitation of older people. Materials and methods In this quasi-experimental study, 24 institutionalized older people with average (SD) age of 80.9 (5.6) years old (16 women) were distributed into two groups (experimental and control). The \{SG\} exercise program was conducted twice a week for three months (20 sessions of 15 to 25 minutes). The participants were evaluated in terms of mobility with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), balance with the Functional Reach Test (FRT), and strength with dynamometer measurements of hand-grip, upper and lower limbs. Results Only the experimental group showed significant changes in post-test measurements regarding functional mobility (TUG: d = -1.3, p = 10-4), balance (FRT: d = 1.2, p = 0.003), and upper and lower limb strengths (d = [0.2–0.6], p = [0.04–0.01]). Discussion The results are in line with previous studies suggesting that the \{SG\} could integrate the therapeutic repertoire to increase the level of physical activity. Moreover, physical stimulation of older people with \{SGs\} is a viable and interesting strategy to involve them in the rehabilitation process. Conclusions The exercise program with the \{SG\} resulted in significant improvements in terms of balance, mobility and strength of large muscle groups of older people with FS. This \{SG\} has a potential for home or institutional use, since it is relatively safe, allows the training of important functions in older people and could help the stimulation and the monitoring of patients in treatment by the health team.

abstract = "Abstract Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and begins with a subtle decline in episodic memory followed by a more general decline in overall cognitive abilities. Though the exact trigger for this cascade of events remains unknown the presence of the misfolded amyloid-beta protein triggers reactive gliosis, a prominent neuropathological feature in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. The cytoskeletal and morphological changes of astrogliosis are its evident features, while changes in oxidative stress defense, cholesterol metabolism, and gene transcription programs are less manifest. However, these latter molecular changes may underlie a disruption in homeostatic regulation that keeps the brain environment balanced. Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease show changes in glutamate and \{GABA\} signaling and recycling, potassium buffering, and in cholinergic, purinergic, and calcium signaling. Ultimately the dysregulation of homeostasis maintained by astrocytes can have grave consequences for the stability of microcircuits within key brain regions. Specifically, altered inhibition influenced by astrocytes can lead to local circuit imbalance with farther reaching consequences for the functioning of larger neuronal networks. Healthy astrocytes have a role in maintaining and modulating normal neuronal communication, synaptic physiology and energy metabolism, astrogliosis interferes with these functions. This review considers the molecular and functional changes occurring during astrogliosis in Alzheimer's disease, and proposes that astrocytes are key players in the development of dementia. "

Setting Community and university hospital. Participants All participants were aged 65 and older. Thirty-five persons with a lifetime history of suicide attempts and depressive disorder were compared with 52 individuals with a past history of depressive disorder but no history suicidal acts, and 43 healthy comparison subjects. Measurements The Iowa Gambling Task was used as a measure of value-based decision-making. Results Taking into account age, sex, and Beck depression scores, no difference in decision-making performance was found between the three groups. The group of suicide attempters exhibited a significant heterogeneity, however, with those using violent means performing worse than non-violent attempters. Conclusions This study does not confirm the hypothesis of a significant role for poor Iowa Gambling Task performance as a general marker of suicidal behavior among the elderly but highlights its association with the specific subtype of violent suicidal attempters. Combined with previous findings among other age groups, it suggests that Iowa Gambling Task impairment may be a risk marker of vulnerability to violent suicidal acts.

The present paper addresses the effects on vigilance states of the mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-40411813 at different circadian times in rats and after afternoon dosing in humans. Due to its dual mGluR2 PAM/serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor antagonism in rodents, mGlu2R specificity of effects was studied in wild-type (WT) and mGluR2 (-/-) mice. 5-HT2A receptor occupancy was determined in humans using positron emission tomography (PET). Tolerance development was examined in rats after chronic dosing. \{EEG\} oscillations and network connectivity were assessed using multi-channel EEG. In rats, JNJ-40411813 increased deep sleep time and latency of \{REM\} onset but reduced \{REM\} time when administered 2 h after ‘lights on’ (CT2): this was sustained after chronic dosing. At \{CT5\} similar effects were elicited, at \{CT10\} only deep sleep was enhanced. Withdrawal resulted in baseline values, while re-administration reinstated drug effects. Parieto-occipital cortical slow theta and gamma oscillations were correlated with low locomotion. The specificity of functional response was confirmed in \{WT\} but not mGluR2 (-/-) mice. A double-blind, placebo-controlled polysomnographic study in healthy, elderly subjects showed that 500 mg of JNJ-40411813 consistently increased deep sleep time, but had no effect on \{REM\} parameters. This deep sleep effect was not explained by 5-HT2A receptor binding, as in the \{PET\} study even 700 mg only marginally displaced the tracer. JNJ-40411813 elicited comparable functional responses in rodents and men if circadian time of dosing was taken into account. These findings underscore the translational potential of sleep mechanisms in evaluating mGluR2 therapeutics when administered at the appropriate circadian time. "

This result holds good even in treatments accounting for wealth differences and experimenter demand effects. However, we observe no difference in behavior when we compare elderly participants and students who have not previously participated in economic experiments. Accordingly, it is possible that the seemingly stronger social preferences of the elderly are due to confounds associated with lack of experience with economic experiments.

Withdrawal from professional activity represents a major statute and role change in one's way of life and the arrival of this moment may represent a great factor of stress which may induce adaptation disorders. The signification of the withdrawal from work and adaptation to the new situation depends on one's attitude towards work, health, financial situation and relationships.

Results In Nold, in \{EO\} condition, the brain network is characterized by more \{SW\} (higher SW) in alpha bands and less \{SW\} (lower SW) in beta2 and gamma bands. In aMCI, \{SW\} has the same trend, except for delta and theta bands where the network shows less small worldness. \{AD\} shows a similar trend of Nold, but with less fluctuations between EO/EC conditions. Furthermore, in both conditions, aMCI \{SW\} architecture presents midway properties between \{AD\} and Nold. At low frequencies (delta e theta bands) in EC, aMCI group presents network’s architecture similar to Nold, while in \{EO\} aMCI, \{SW\} is superimposable to \{AD\} ones.

Studies in mice have suggested beneficial effects of selenium (Se) supplementation on immunity to flu but similar evidence is lacking in humans. A dietary intervention study was therefore designed to test the effects of Se-supplementation on a variety of parameters of anti-flu immunity in healthy subjects aged 50–64 years. Methods A 12-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00279812) was undertaken in six groups of individuals with plasma Se levels &lt;110 ng/mL. Four groups were given daily capsules of yeast enriched with 0 µg Se/day (SeY-0/d; n = 20), 50 µg Se/d (SeY-50/d; n = 18), 100 µg Se/d (SeY-100/d; n = 21) or 200 µg Se/d (SeY-200/d; n = 23). Two groups were given onion-containing meals with either &lt;1 µg Se/d (SeO-0/d; n = 17) or 50 µg Se/d (SeO-50/d; n = 18). Flu vaccine was administrated at week 10 and immune parameters were assessed until week 12. Results Primary study endpoints were changes in cellular and humoral immune responses. Supplementation with SeY and SeO affected different aspects of cellular immunity. SeY increased Tctx-ADCC cell counts in blood (214%, SeY-100/d) before flu vaccination and a dose-dependent increase in T cell proliferation (500%, SeY-50/100/200/d), IL-8 (169%, SeY-100/d) and IL-10 (317%, SeY-200/d) secretion after in vivo flu challenge. Positive effects were contrasted by lower granzyme B content of CD8 cells (55%, SeY-200/d). SeO (Se 50 µg/d) also enhanced T cell proliferation after vaccination (650%), IFN-? (289%), and IL-8 secretion (139%), granzyme (209%) and perforin (190%) content of CD8 cells but inhibited TNF-a synthesis (42%). Onion on its own reduced the number of \{NKT\} cells in blood (38%). These effects were determined by comparison to group-specific baseline yeast or onion control groups. Mucosal flu-specific antibody responses were unaffected by Se-supplementation. Conclusion Se-supplementation in healthy human adults with marginal Se status resulted in both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity to flu that was affected by the form of Se, supplemental dose and delivery matrix. These observations call for a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits associated with Se-supplementation. "

Crucial among these are the sexual, psychosocial and somatic challenges facing the elderly, and the factors that may influence these. The Aging Males’ Symptoms (AMS) scale was primarily designed for international comparability on measures of quality of life (QoL) among the elderly. The validity and reliability of this instrument have been tested in Nigeria and results confirm its comparability with results from other countries. It is pertinent to examine the influence of some socio-economic factors on the self-reported severity of sexual, psychosocial and somatic measures on the AMS. Methods The \{AMS\} instrument was administered to 456 males aged 60 years and above in selected communities in Ijesaland, South-West Nigeria. The \{AMS\} has 17 items and scoring was done on a scale of 1–5 based on the level of severity. Three outcome variables for psychosocial, somatic and sexual scores were used together with socio-economic variables as co-variates. \{STATA\} 11 was used for the analyses, which included frequency distribution, chi-square test and logistic regression model. Results In the bi-variate analysis, wealth index was the only statistically significant variable for predicting the odds of each of the three outcome variables. A logistic regression model showed that higher education and middle income were significant predictors of high severity on the psychosocial score. Oldest age group, polygamous union and a high wealth index were significant predictors of higher somatic scores. None of the co-variates were significantly associated with the sexual score. Conclusion The study concluded that wealth index and other proxies of empowerment, such as education, to a great extent influence quality of life. "

Critical to their implementation is transparent integration of diverse hardware and its ubiquitous communication with multiple software components. Modern controllers (Wii family, Microsoft Kinect, Neurosky Mindwave) are especially useful in elderly smart homes, being used, for healthcare monitoring and exercise gaming interventions. Presented herein is a novel Controller Application Communication (CAC) framework for cross device, application independent transmission of controller data to multiple software components. For the first time, a framework supports multiple modern controllers concurrently communicating with multiple, device naïve, requesting applications, utilizing standard, real time, internet communication technologies, as opposed to current practices which focus merely on one device. The framework consists of uniform schemas for encapsulating controllers’ data and of services necessary for communicating these data to the requesting software components. The framework’s architecture is based on distributed computing principles, delegating server duties to use-site gateways for reducing main server load. This framework was utilized in the \{USEFIL\} project for simultaneous use of multiple controllers and sensors by different software components of the platform. The framework’s design principles align with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Future work, enriching this framework, aims to facilitate a more diverse controller set, adhering to an IoT architecture implementation, as well as, allowing on-demand online data streaming, thereby enabling interested parties to test algorithms with data from ecologically valid environments.

However, there is little direct evidence that reduction measures which decrease particulate air pollution would lead to a reduction in \{CVD\} mortality. Objectives In Beijing, China, air quality improvement strategies were developed and actions were taken before and during the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the aim of the study was to assess the effects of changes in particulate air pollution before (May 20–July 20, 2008), during (August 1–September 20, 2008) and after (October 1–December 1, 2008) the Olympics period. Methods Concentrations of air pollution, meteorology and \{CVD\} death counts were obtained from official networks and monitoring sites located on the Peking University campus. Air pollution effects with lags of 0–4 days as well as of the 5-day average on cause-specific \{CVD\} mortality were investigated for the complete study period (May 20–December 1, 2008) using Quasi-Poisson regression models. Different gender and age subgroups were taken into account. Additionally, effect modification by air mass origin was investigated. In a second step, air pollution effects were estimated for the three specific periods by including an interaction term in the models. Results We observed large concentration decreases in all measured air pollutants during the unique pollution intervention for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. For the whole period, adverse effects of particulate air pollution were observed on \{CVD\} mortality with a 1-day delay as well as for the 5-day average exposure, e.g. an 8.8% (95%CI: 2.7–15.2%) increase in \{CVD\} mortality with an interquartile range increase in ultrafine particles. The effects were more pronounced in females, the elderly and for cerebrovascular deaths, but not modified by air mass origin. The specific sub-period analysis results suggested that the risks of \{CVD\} mortality were lowest during the Olympic Games where strongest reduction measures have been applied. Conclusions The results indicated that the reduction of air pollution due to air quality control measures led to a decreased risk of \{CVD\} mortality in Beijing. Our findings provide new insight into efforts to reduce ambient air pollution. "

It is well known to most clinicians as a cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Klebsiella is an opportunistic pathogen, that primarily attacks neonates, infants, elderly and immuno-compromised patients and therefore impose a serious, emerging public health hazard globally. Contaminated sprouts, vegetables, seafood and other animal meat products are considered as main sources of Klebsiella infection. In the current study, radiation sensitivity of K. pneumoniae \{MTCC\} 109 was determined in different food samples. The decimal reduction dose (D10) values of K. pneumoniae \{MTCC\} 109 in saline and nutrient broth at 0–4 °C were 0.116±0.009, 0.136±0.005 kGy, respectively. The mixed sprouts, fish and poultry samples were inoculated with K. pneumoniae \{MTCC\} 109 and exposed to gamma radiation to evaluate the effectiveness of radiation treatment in the elimination of K. pneumoniae. \{D10\} values of K. pneumoniae in mixed sprouts, poultry and fish samples were found to be 0.142±0.009, 0.125±0.0004 and 0.277±0.012 kGy, respectively. Radiation treatment with a 1.5 kGy dose resulted in the complete elimination of 3.1±1.8×105 CFU/g of K. pneumoniae from these food samples. No recovery of K. pneumoniae was observed in the 1.5 kGy treated samples stored at 4 °C up to 12 days, even after enrichment and selective plating. This study shows that a 1.5 kGy dose of irradiation treatment could lead to the complete elimination of 3.1±1.8×105 CFU/g of K. pneumoniae from mixed sprouts, poultry and fish samples. "

However, little is known regarding \{GD\} in older adults. The prevalence and acceptance of gambling vary among different cultures and this raises the question of how and to what extent culture affects older gamblers. The majority of the important studies regarding \{GD\} in older adults have been conducted mainly in Anglo-Saxon cultures and little information is available regarding \{GD\} in other cultures. The objective of this paper is to perform the first standardized cross-cultural comparison regarding older adults presenting GD. Methods The total studied sample involved 170 subjects: 89 from the Brazilian (BR) sample and 81 from the American (US) sample. It consisted of 67 men and 103 women (average age = 64.42, standard deviation = ±3.86). They were evaluated for socio-demographics, gambling behavior variables and psychiatric antecedents. Results Overall, there were significant differences between \{BR\} and \{US\} older adult gamblers in marital status, onset of gambling activity, onset of \{GD\} and urge scores. Discussion This study showed that there are important differences in gambling course, gambling behavior and personal antecedents between two samples of older adults presenting \{GD\} from countries with different social-cultural background. It weakens the possibility of generalization of results found in Anglo-Saxon countries to other cultures and reinforces for the need for development of research on \{GD\} in older adults outside the Anglo-Saxon culture.

Design Feasibility/Acceptability Study and Quasi-Experimental Trial. Method Sixteen outpatients with schizophrenia received treatment as usual and they all completed an 8-week exergame intervention using Microsoft Kinect® (20 min sessions, biweekly). Participants completed pre and post treatment assessments regarding functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test), functional fitness performance (Senior Fitness Test), motor neurological soft signs (Brief Motor Scale), hand grip strength (digital dynamometer), static balance (force plate), speed of processing (Trail Making Test), schizophrenia-related symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale). The \{EG\} group completed an acceptability questionnaire after the intervention. Results Attrition rate was 18.75% and 69.23% of the participants completed the intervention within the proposed schedule. Baseline clinical traits were not related to game performance indicators. Over 90% of the participants rated the intervention as satisfactory and interactive. Most participants (76.9%) agreed that this intervention promotes healthier lifestyles and is an acceptable alternative to perform physical activity. Repeated-measures \{MANOVA\} analyses found no significant multivariate effects for combined outcomes. Conclusion This study established the feasibility and acceptability of an exergame intervention for outpatients with schizophrenia. The intervention proved to be an appealing alternative to physical activity. Future trials should include larger sample sizes, explore patients' adherence to home-based exergames and consider greater intervention dosage (length, session duration, and/or frequency) in order to achieve potential effects.

However, the relationships between microbial dynamics, age-related changes in intestinal physiology, and organismal health remain poorly understood. Here, we show that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by an expansion of the Gammaproteobacteria, is tightly linked to age-onset intestinal barrier dysfunction in Drosophila. Indeed, alterations in the microbiota precede and predict the onset of intestinal barrier dysfunction in aged flies. Changes in microbial composition occurring prior to intestinal barrier dysfunction contribute to changes in excretory function and immune gene activation in the aging intestine. In addition, we show that a distinct shift in microbiota composition follows intestinal barrier dysfunction, leading to systemic immune activation and organismal death. Our results indicate that alterations in microbiota dynamics could contribute to and also predict varying rates of health decline during aging in mammals. "

The aim of this study was to analyse the contribution of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT) to \{TB\} diagnosis. Methods Sixty patients hospitalized with TB, for whom a QFT-GIT assay had been performed between June 2008 and June 2011 at the University Hospital of Bondy in the north-east of Paris, were identified retrospectively. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of the QFT-GIT were all calculated. Furthermore, the characteristics of patients testing positive were compared to those of patients testing negative, as well as the QFT-GIT values according to several different factors. Results The sensitivity of the QFT-GIT was 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.92) and specificity was 73.3% (95% \{CI\} 0.68–0.78). The positive predictive value was 39.5% and the negative predictive value was 97.3%. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.2 and 0.20, respectively. The prevalence of \{TB\} in this population was 15% (pre-test probability). After a positive test result, the probability of \{TB\} increased to 40% (post-positive probability test); after a negative test result, it decreased to 4.5% (post-negative probability test). The combination of the QFT-GIT test with the tuberculin skin test brought no significant improvement in sensitivity. Factors significantly associated with a negative QFT-GIT result included older age, high C-reactive protein, a low lymphocyte count, and immunosuppressant intake. The test value in quantitative terms was significantly higher in those with lymph node \{TB\} than in those with pulmonary TB, and in younger patients (&lt;40 years) than in older patients (&gt;40 years old). Conclusion On its own, QFT-GIT is an insufficient tool to confirm the diagnosis of \{TB\} disease. However, it may form part of an ensemble of tools in combination with clinical, biological, and radiological assessments. "

Methods This study used a distributed lag nonlinear model with Poisson distribution to estimate cumulative 6-day (lags 0–5) relative risks (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality and \{ERV\} of all causes, circulatory diseases, and respiratory diseases associated with daily concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and \{PM\} constituents (organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate and sulfate). Results Mortality and \{ERVs\} were associated with \{PM\} concentrations and its constituents. The elderly all-cause mortality was significantly associated with nitrate concentrations (RR = 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.23) at 1 µg/m3) and \{OC\} higher than 15 µg/m3; and mortality from circulatory diseases was significantly associated with \{PM10\} (RR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.25) at 50 µg/m3), PM2.5 (RR = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.34) at 30 µg/m3), nitrate higher than 8 µg/m3, and sulfate (RR = 1.31 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.54) at 7 µg/m3). An increase in PM2.5 from 5 µg/m3 to 30 µg/m3 was associated with increased \{ERV\} risk of all causes and respiratory diseases with cumulative 6-day \{RRs\} of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.18) and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.46), respectively. All-cause \{ERV\} was significantly associated with concentrations of \{OC\} (RR = 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) at 4 µg/m3), \{EC\} (RR = 1.08 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.12) at 2 µg/m3), nitrate higher than 6 µg/m3, and sulfate higher than 8 µg/m3.

Calcium and vitamin D have been and are still considered the main important nutrient for preventing bone loss with aging. Nevertheless, other nutrients are emerging to improve bone strength. Olive oil is an example. Recent in vitro studies have shown that oleuropein, the main phenolic compound in virgin olive oil, reduced the expression of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-?, inhibiting adipocyte differentiation and enhancing differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts. In addition, oleuropein administration led to increase the gene expression of osteoblastogenesis markers. In concordance with these in vitro experiments, a prospective effect of olive oil and oleuropein has been also observed in animal models and in humans. This limited evidences led us to suggest that olive oil consumption might exert a positive role in bone health, mainly in osteoporosis prevention. "

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA), known for their lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive properties, may have therapeutic potential for the management of NAFLD. The aim of this study was to determine whether n-3PUFA levels are associated with the prevalence of \{NAFLD\} in older adults. Methods A cross-sectional sample of older adults aged 65–95 years (n = 620) from the Retirement Health and Lifestyle Study (RHLS) was analysed. Fatty Liver Index (FLI) scores, used as an indicator of \{NAFLD\} risk, were calculated using a validated algorithm that incorporates body mass index, waist circumference, plasma triglycerides and ?-glutamyl transferase. Omega-3 index scores (O3I, %eicosapentaenoic acid plus %docosahexaenoic acid) were determined by analysing the fatty acid composition of erythrocyte membranes by gas chromatography. Results Following application of exclusion criteria, 475 participants were included in the analysis (age 77.9 ± 7.0 years; 60.4% females). Of these, 216 participants had \{FLI\} scores (=60) suggestive of \{NAFLD\} (age 77.0 ± 6.6 years; 49.1% females). \{O3I\} was significantly lower in participants with \{NAFLD\} compared to those without \{NAFLD\} (p &lt; 0.01). A significant inverse relationship was found between \{O3I\} and \{FLI\} (r = -0.165; p &lt; 0.001). This relationship was gender specific with women, but not men, showing a significant association (r = -0.206; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The current study demonstrated a sex-dependent inverse relationship between erythrocyte n-3PUFA concentrations and \{NAFLD\} in older adults. The finding supports the proposal for sex-stratified n-3PUFA intervention trials in this high-risk age group. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground Manganese (Mn) is an essential element that can become neurotoxic through various exposure windows over the lifespan. While there is clear evidence of Mn neurotoxicity in pediatric and adult occupational populations, little is known about effects in the elderly who may exhibit enhanced susceptibilities due to compromised physiology compared to younger adults. In the province of Brescia, Italy, the Valcamonica area has been the site of three ferroalloy plants operating from 1902 to 2001. Metal emissions of Mn and to a lesser extent lead (Pb) have impacted the surrounding environment, where a high prevalence of Parkinsonism was previously observed. This study aimed to assess neurocognitive and motor functions in healthy elderly subjects residing for most of their lifetime in Valcamonica or in a reference area unimpacted by ferroalloy plant activity. Methods Subjects were enrolled for extensive neurobehavioral assessment of motor, cognitive and sensory functions. Exposure was assessed with 24 h personal air sampling for \{PM10\} airborne particles, surface soil and tap water measurement at individual households, Mn levels in blood and urine and Pb in blood. Dose–response relationships between exposure indicators and biomarkers and health outcomes were analyzed with generalized (linear and logistic) additive models (GAM). Results A total of 255 subjects (55% women) were examined; most (52.9%) were within the 65–70 years age class. Average airborne Mn was 26.41 ng/m3 (median 18.42) in Valcamonica and 20.96 ng/m3 (median 17.62) in the reference area. Average Mn in surface soil was 1026 ppm (median 923) in Valcamonica and 421 ppm (median 410) in the reference area. Manganese in drinking water was below the \{LDL\} of 1 µg/L. The \{GAM\} analysis showed significant association between airborne Mn (p = 0.0237) and the motor coordination tests of the Luria Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. The calculation of the Benchmark Dose using this dose–response relationship yielded a lower level confidence interval of 22.7 ng/m3 (median 26.4). For the odor identification score of the Sniffin Stick test, an association was observed with soil Mn (p = 0.0006) and with a significant interaction with blood Pb (p = 0.0856). Significant dose–responses resulted also for the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices with the distance from exposure point source (p = 0.0025) and Mn in soil (p = 0.09), and for the Trail Making test, with urinary Mn (p = 0.0074). Serum prolactin (PRL) levels were associated with air (p = 0.061) and urinary (p = 0.003) Mn, and with blood Pb (p = 0.0303). In most of these associations age played a significant role as an effect modifier. Conclusion Lifelong exposure to Mn was significantly associated with changes in odor discrimination, motor coordination, cognitive abilities and serum \{PRL\} levels. These effects are consistent with the hypothesis of a specific mechanism of toxicity of Mn on the dopaminergic system. Lead co-exposure, even at very low levels, can further enhance Mn toxicity. "

Although CD4+ T cells play an essential role in many immune responses, few studies have directly assessed the effect of aging on the balance between effector T (Teff) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here, we determined if and how aging affects the ratio between Treg and Teff cells. Percentages of both naive Treg (nTreg; CD45RA+CD25intFOXP3low) and memory Treg (memTreg; CD45RA-CD25highFOXP3high) cells were determined by flow cytometry in peripheral blood samples of healthy individuals of various ages (20–84 years). Circulating Th1, Th2 and Th17 effector cells were identified by intracellular staining for IFN-?, IL-4 and IL-17, respectively, upon in vitro stimulation with \{PMA\} and calcium ionophore. Whereas proportions of nTreg cells declined with age, memTreg cells increased. Both Th1 and Th2 cells were largely maintained in the circulation of aged humans, whereas Th17 cells were decreased. Similar to memTreg cells, the 3 Teff subsets resided primarily in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment. Overall, Treg/Teff ratios were increased in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment of aged individuals when compared to that of young individuals. Finally, the relative increase of memTreg cells in elderly individuals was associated with poor responses to influenza vaccination. Taken together, our findings imply that aging disturbs the balance between Treg cells and Teff cells. "

The cellular and molecular link between ageing and virus infection is unclear and it is possible that damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may play a role in the raised severity and susceptibility of virus infections in the elderly. \{DAMPs\} which are released from damaged cells following activation, injury or cell death can activate the immune response through the stimulation of the inflammasome through several types of receptors found on the plasma membrane, inside endosomes after endocytosis as well as in the cytosol. In this review, the detriment in the immune system during ageing and the links between influenza virus infection and ageing will be discussed. In addition, the role of \{DAMPs\} such as \{HMGB1\} and S100/Annexin in ageing, and the enhanced morbidity and mortality to severe influenza infection in ageing will be highlighted. "

We analyzed brain activity in 41 elderly subjects performing a 3-stimulus visual oddball task. In addition to the average amplitude of event-related fields in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), high-gamma power in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the strength of high-gamma imaginary coherence between the right \{MFG\} and the left MFG, and those between the right \{MFG\} and the left thalamus predicted individual differences in reaction time. In addition, high-gamma power in the left \{MFG\} was correlated with task accuracy, whereas high-gamma power in the left thalamus and left \{IPS\} was correlated with individual processing speed. The direction of correlations indicated that higher high-gamma power or coherence in an attention network was associated with better task performance and, presumably, higher cognitive function. Thus, high-gamma activity in different regions of this attention network differentially contributed to attentional processing, and such activity could be a fundamental process associated with individual differences in cognitive aging.

However, functional changes associated with telomere shortening are poorly understood. We hypothesized that war veterans with \{PTSD\} would have shorter telomeres in \{PBMCs\} and that these cells might exhibit changes in measures of immune reactivity such as proliferation, cytokine production and expression of regulators of immune responses. Methods We measured relative telomere length and basal telomerase activity in \{PBMCs\} of 62 individuals (PTSD patients (N = 30); age-matched healthy controls (N = 17), elderly volunteers (N = 15)). In parallel, we have assessed proliferation of activated T cells, interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-6 cytokine production and expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1 on activated T cells. Results Middle-aged war veterans with current \{PTSD\} had shorter \{PBMC\} telomere length than their age-matched healthy controls while the elderly had the shortest telomeres. There was no difference in telomerase activity between \{PTSD\} patients and healthy controls while telomerase activity was significantly lower in the elderly. While the elderly group exhibited robust changes in immune activity such as increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6) and reduced proliferation of all T cells, the \{PTSD\} group showed reduced proliferative response of CD8+ T cells to high concentrations of mitogen and reduced spontaneous production of IL-2 and IFN-?. Conclusions This study adds to the accumulating evidence that psychological trauma and chronic stress are associated with accelerated telomere attrition. However, changes in immune function associated with stress-related telomere shortening are not well understood. Although much less pronounced in \{PTSD\} patients than in elderly persons, reduced proliferative responses of T cells accompanied by shorter telomeres might be a sign of early immunosenescence. Together with reduced production of Th1 cytokines, observed immune changes may contribute to health risks associated with PTSD. "

Results Optimal control can be achieved through simultaneous use of the control parameters, though it varies from society to society. The control corresponding to prevention needed to be implemented in full almost all the time for all types of societies. In the case of the other two controls, the scenario was greatly affected depending on the types of societies. Conclusion Prevention and treatment for elderly people with ludomania are the main intervention strategies. We found that optimal timely implementation of the intervention strategies was more effective. The optimal control strategy varied with the initial number of gamblers. However, three intervention strategies were considered, among which, preventing people from engaging in all types of gambling proved to be the most crucial. "

Healthy adults (n=20) played a weight shifting exergame under five different conditions with varying amplitudes and speed of sway movement, while 3D positions of ten body segments were recorded in the frontal plane using Kinect and a Vicon 3D camera system. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to extract and compare movement patterns and the variance in individual body segment positions explained by these patterns. Using the identified patterns, balance outcome measures based on spatiotemporal sway characteristics were computed. The results showed that both Vicon and Kinect capture &gt;90% variance of all body segment movements within three PCs. Kinect-derived movement patterns were found to explain variance in trunk movements accurately, yet explained variance in hand and foot segments was underestimated and overestimated respectively by as much as 30%. Differences between both systems with respect to balance outcome measures range 0.3–64.3%.

We assessed the associations of these factors, at pre-specified lags, with daily total, cardiovascular (CVD) and respiratory mortality and hospitalizations using Poisson regression. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were expressed as percentage change per interquartile range increment in source-factor mass or number concentration. We evaluated the sensitivity of associations to adjustment for multiple other factors and by season. Results We found no evidence of associations between \{PM10\} or \{NSD\} source-related factors and daily mortality, as the direction of the estimates were variable with 95% \{CI\} spanning 0%. Traffic-related \{PM10\} and \{NSD\} displayed consistent associations with \{CVD\} admissions aged 15–64 years (1.01% (95%CI: 0.03%, 2.00%) and 1.04% (95%CI: - 0.62%, 2.72%) respectively) as did particles from background urban sources (0.36% for \{PM10\} and 0.81% for NSD). Most sources were positively associated with pediatric (0–14 years) respiratory hospitalizations, with stronger evidence for fuel oil \{PM10\} (3.43%, 95%CI: 1.26%, 5.65%). Our results did not suggest associations with cardiovascular admissions in 65 + or respiratory admissions in 15 + age groups. Effect estimates were generally robust to adjustment for other factors and by season. Conclusions Our findings are broadly consistent with the growing evidence of the toxicity of traffic and combustion particles, particularly in relation to respiratory morbidity in children and cardiovascular morbidity in younger adults.

Knowledge was positively correlated with perceived benefits (f = .29) and susceptibility (f = .20). Preventive behaviors (f = .20) were positively correlated with perceived benefits. Self-efficacy correlated positively with preventive behaviors (f = .24) and perceived benefits (f = .37) and negatively with perceived susceptibility (f = -.11). Goodness-of-fit indices suggested a good fit of this model (root mean square error of approximation, .037; comparative fit index, 0.98; relative fit index; .96). Discussion Older adults who have knowledge of dementia and perceive benefit from diagnosis and treatment are more likely to exhibit willingness and confidence to be tested for cognitive problems. Individuals with high self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility, and positive preventive health behaviors are also more likely to exhibit intention. These constructs can now be used to develop interventions to evaluate cognitive health in the elderly. "

This study investigated the association between the ambient concentrations of \{PM\} with varies sizes (5.6–560 nm) and a biomarker of acute respiratory inflammation, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), in a panel of 55 elderly people in Shanghai, China. Linear mixed-effect model was fitted to estimate the association between \{FENO\} and moving average concentrations of PM, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, and age. Results showed that among the measured particles size range, Aitken-mode (20–100 nm) particles had the strongest positive association with increased \{FENO\} when using moving average concentration of \{PM\} up to 24 h prior to visits. The estimates were robust to the adjustment for gender, condition of chronic disease and use of medication, and to the sensitive analysis using different times of visits. The authors concluded that the association between acute respiratory inflammation and \{PM\} concentration of fine particulates depended on particle size, and suggested Aitken-mode particles may be the most responsible for this adverse health association.

Previous studies have demonstrated altered gamma oscillations in the elderly population that may be related to general cognitive decline. However, it is unknown how gamma oscillations change with age or if there is an age when gamma oscillations optimally mediate working memory performance. That is, gamma oscillations may be maximal in middle-aged adults compared to younger and elderly adults. The objective of this study was to evaluate working memory evoked gamma oscillations in adults aged 19–29 years (mean 23.32±2.85 1 SD) compared to adults aged 30–60 years (mean 39.10±8.11 1 SD). Methods Subjects completed the verbal N-back task administered at four working loads (0, 1, 2, 3), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Gamma power was measured during correct responses. Results Reduced gamma oscillations were observed in the adults aged 19–29 compared to those aged 30–60 years. Age was found to be positively related to the power of gamma oscillations. No differences were found on N-Back accuracy. Conclusions Increased working memory evoked gamma oscillatory activity may provide a neurophysiological marker in the healthy aging brain. "

abstract = "Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly in developed countries. \{AMD\} is classified as either neovascular (NV-AMD) or non-neovascular (NNV-AMD). Cumulative damage to the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch's membrane, and choriocapillaris leads to dysfunction and loss of \{RPE\} cells. This causes degeneration of the overlying photoreceptors and consequential vision loss in advanced NNV-AMD (Geographic Atrophy). In NV-AMD, abnormal growth of capillaries under the retina and RPE, which leads to hemorrhage and fluid leakage, is the main cause of photoreceptor damage. Although a number of drugs (e.g., anti-VEGF) are in use for NV-AMD, there is currently no treatment for advanced NNV-AMD. However, replacing dead or dysfunctional \{RPE\} with healthy \{RPE\} has been shown to rescue dying photoreceptors and improve vision in animal models of retinal degeneration and possibly in \{AMD\} patients. Differentiation of \{RPE\} from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-RPE) and from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE) has created a potentially unlimited source for replacing dead or dying RPE. Such cells have been shown to incorporate into the degenerating retina and result in anatomic and functional improvement. However, major ethical, regulatory, safety, and technical challenges have yet to be overcome before stem cell-based therapies can be used in standard treatments. This review outlines the current knowledge surrounding the application of hESC-RPE and iPSC-RPE in AMD. Following an introduction on the pathogenesis and available treatments of AMD, methods to generate stem cell-derived RPE, immune reaction against such cells, and approaches to deliver desired cells into the eye will be explored along with broader issues of efficacy and safety. Lastly, strategies to improve these stem cell-based treatments will be discussed. "

Methods We took advantage of the artificially controlled changes in air pollution levels that occurred during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China and conducted a panel study of 201 Beijing residents. Data were collected before, during, and after the Olympics, respectively. Linear mixed-effect models and generalized estimating equation models were used to compare measurements of peak expiratory flow, breath rate and blood pressure across three time points. Results The mean values of peak expiratory flow were 346.0 L/min, 399.3 L/min, and 364.1 L/min over the three study periods. Peak expiratory flow levels increased in 78% of the participants when comparing the during- with pre- Olympics time points, while peak expiratory flow levels decreased in 80% of participants for the post- and during-Olympic periods comparison. In subgroup analyses comparing the during-Olympic to pre-Olympic time points, we found a larger percentage change in peak expiratory flow (+17%) among female, younger and non-smoking participants than among male, elderly and smoking participants (+12%). The percentage of participants with a fast breath rate (&gt;20/min) changed from 9.7% to 4.9% to 30.1% among females, and from 7.9% to 2.6% to 27.3% among males over the three time points. The changes in blood pressure over the three study periods were not very clear, although there is an increase in diastolic pressure and a decrease in pulse pressure among males during the games. Conclusions The results suggest that exposure to different air pollution levels has significant effects on respiratory function.

Challenging aging brains through cognitive training and physical exercises has shown to be effective against age-related cognitive decline and disease. But how effective are such training interventions? What is the optimal combination/strategy? Is there enough evidence from neuropsychological observations, animal studies, as well as, structural and functional neuroimaging investigations to interpret the underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the observed neuroplasticity of the aging brain? This piece of work summarizes recent findings toward these questions, but also highlights the role of functional brain connectivity work, an emerging discipline for future research in healthy aging and the study of the underlying mechanisms across the life span. The ultimate aim is to conclude on recommended multimodal training, in light of contemporary trends in the design of exergaming interventions. The latter issue is discussed in conjunction with building up neuroscientific knowledge and envisaged future research challenges in mapping, understanding and training the aging brain. "

The primary end point was patient-reported total sleep time (TST); other patient–reported end points included sleep latency (SL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings, sleep quality, and satisfaction with sleep duration. Measures to assess the potential adverse effects of treatment included morning alertness, daytime function/napping, and rebound insomnia during a single-blind placebo run-out week after treatment ended. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. Results Overall, 526 patients were randomized and 463 (88%) completed treatment. All esmirtazapine doses significantly improved TST, SL, sleep quality, and satisfaction with sleep duration versus placebo. Relative to placebo, \{TST\} was increased by 30–40?min and \{SL\} decreased by ~12?min for all doses. The highest dose (4.5 mg) also significantly reduced \{WASO\} and number of awakenings. Across doses, \{AEs\} occurred in 25.5–32.8% of patients, compared with 20.7% with placebo. The most common \{AE\} was somnolence (~10% for esmirtazapine and 2% for placebo). The incidence of \{AEs\} leading to discontinuation was low (=7%), and there were no serious drug–related AEs. Finally, there was no evidence of a rebound insomnia after discontinuation of esmirtazapine. Conclusions Two weeks of treatment with esmirtazapine consistently and significantly improved patient-reported sleep parameters, and it was well tolerated in patients with primary insomnia. "

Accommodation in this context is understood as responsiveness to the singularity of older adults, and we consider how this idea might be used to support opportunities for (independent) living for elders as they age and become frailer. To elaborate the question we draw on examples from our empirical work – ethnographic studies of home care practice undertaken in Canada and Iceland – and consider these examples in light of critical philosophical and social theory, particularly Agamben's (1993) work, The Coming Community. This is a relevant frame through which to consider the potential for the accommodation of the unique needs of older adults in home care because it helps us to problematize the systems through which care is accomplished and the current, dominant terms of relations between individuals and collectives. We argue that giving substance to a notion of accommodation contributes an important dimension to aligned ideas, such as patient-centeredness in care, by working to shift the intentionality of these practices. That is, accommodation, as an orientation to care practices, contests the organizational impulse to carry on in the usual way. "

abstract = "Abstract Time perception is a important subject in cognitive psychology, which is essential for our understanding of brain mechanisms underlying human cognition. Many cognitive functions, like learning, memory, language, decision making, or concept formation may be characterized by regular changes in time-varying processes. The patterning in time, therefore, seems an essential feature of our ‘working brains’. Many previous literature reports and studies conducted indicate age-related decline in our mental activity (e.g., Szymaszek, Sereda, Pöppel, &amp; Szelag, 2009; Szelag et al., 2009). Such cognitive deterioration is often observed beyond 65 years of life and accompanied by less efficient timing processes. In the present study, we focused on rapid auditory processing in some tens of milliseconds. The study was aimed at improving cognitive function in elderly following the specific training in temporal information processing using the Fast ForWord (FFW) program. This program is composed of several games designed to improve memory, attention, and sequencing abilities and it was developed to help children with difficulties in reading, writing, and learning Thirty healthy subjects between 65 and 75 years of age were randomly assigned to three groups. One group received temporal training using the FFW. The second group participated in non-temporal training by playing common computer games. The third group underwent no training. Before and after the training, all of the subjects went through a number of tests to measure the level of their cognitive functioning. We assessed: (1) temporal processing by measuring sequencing abilities; (2) three aspects of attention, i.e., vigilance (the ability to sustain attention over a longer period of time), divided attention (the ability to pay attention to multiple processes), and alertness (the ability to maintain a high level of attention in anticipation of a test stimulus); (3) short- term memory with tests evaluating working memory span, as well as the ability to match complex patterns and the ability to recognize a pattern seen earlier. Prior to training no significant differences were found among the three groups. After the training, Group A showed improved temporal information processing accompanied by amelioration of some attentional and memory resources. Our study showed, for the first time, significant benefits of temporal training on broad aspects of cognitive function in elderly. We found that elderly who underwent temporal training improved not only the rate at which they processed auditory temporal information, but also in other cognitive processes. These results support the thesis on the ‘timing-cognition’ interrelationship and offer new horizons for neurorehabilitation of declined mental activity in elderly population (Szelag et al., 2011; Szelag &amp; Skolimowska, 2012).

In study 2, healthy elderly persons (n=16) and healthy young persons (n=16) volunteered. Intervention In study 1 and study 2, the tongue training lasted 30 and 40 minutes, respectively. Participants were instructed to play a computer game with the tongue using TDS. Main Outcome Measures Motor performance was compared between groups in both studies. Correlation analyses were performed between age and relative improvement in performance. Subject-based reports of motivation, fun, pain, and fatigue evaluated on 0-to-10 numeric rating scales were compared between groups. Results In study 1, tongue-disabled patients performed poorer than healthy controls (P=.005) and with a trend of a sex difference (P=.046). In study 2, healthy young participants performed better than healthy elderly participants (P&lt;.001), but there was no effect of sex (P=.140). There was a significant negative correlation between age and relative improvement in performance (d=-.450; P=.009). There were no significant differences in subject-based reports of motivation, fun, pain, and fatigue between groups in any of the studies (P&gt;.094). Conclusions The present study provides evidence that tongue disability and age can influence behavioral measures of tongue motor performance. \{TDS\} may be a new adjunctive neurorehabilitation regimen in treating tongue-disabled patients.

Methods The data were retained from a population-based health survey on 2,494 community-dwelling older adults age 65 years or more participating in the \{ESA\} (Étude sur la Santé des Aînés) study. Depression and anxiety were assessed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria and measured at two time points 1 year apart. Annual healthcare costs considered included hospitalizations, emergency and outpatient visits, physician fees, and outpatient medications. Health service use and costs were identified from provincial administrative databases. Costs were studied as a function of the presence (yes/no) of depression and anxiety, and as persistence, incidence/remission, and no illness. Generalized linear models with a gamma distribution (log link) were used to control for a number of factors. Results Participants with depression had higher outpatient mental health–related costs. Participants with anxiety had higher total healthcare costs and specifically outpatient costs and inpatient costs. As opposed to people without depression and anxiety, persistent cases had higher mean costs followed by people with the disorders for only part of the year. Most of these differences were explained by sociodemographic and clinical factors. The excess annual adjusted healthcare costs of depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety reached $27.4, $80.0, and $119.8 million per 1,000,000 population of elderly, respectively. Conclusion The excess costs of depression and anxiety in community-dwelling elderly are just as significant as those observed for adults even when productivity losses are not considered. Adequately managing depression and anxiety in the older adult population may lead to important healthcare cost savings for society. "

Signalling identity to conspecifics and the perception of the calling individual by receivers allow for appropriate behavioural responses based on experience of previous interactions. Contact calls help maintain group cohesion and often provide individual signatures. Giant otters, endemic to Amazonian rainforests and wetlands, are a highly social and vocally active species. Their family groups consist of a monogamous alpha pair with offspring of different ages, and elder siblings assist in rearing the young. During collective fishing bouts, individuals frequently become separated from their group. Giant otters use two types of cohesion calls. The ‘contact call’ is often uttered when the otters are visually separated, and is then followed by the reunion of group members. The ‘hum’ is produced in close proximity to manage group movements. We predicted giant otters would have individually distinct cohesion calls and be able to discriminate between the cohesion calls of different individuals. We recorded and measured calls from wild and captive individuals and conducted habituation–dishabituation playbacks with two captive groups. Our results provided statistical evidence for a strong individual signature in contact calls but not in hums. Nevertheless, the giant otters were able to distinguish individuals in both cohesion calls tested. We conclude that individual signatures seem to be advantageous in terms of managing group movements. Giant otters might additionally benefit from discriminating individuals within their social group, where kin recognition is insufficient to identify equally related individuals that cooperate in hunting and rearing of the young.

The purposes of this study were to examine the level and cytokine production of circulating \{MAIT\} cells and their subsets in healthy adults and to investigate potential relationships between clinical parameters and \{MAIT\} cell levels or their subset levels. One hundred thirty-three healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. \{MAIT\} cells, their subset, and cytokine levels were measured by flow cytometry. Circulating \{MAIT\} cell levels were found to vary widely (0.19% to 21.7%) in the study subjects and to be significantly lower in elderly subjects (age, 61–92 years) than in young subjects (age, 21–40 years) (p &lt; 0.0005). No significant difference was found in the circulating \{MAIT\} cell levels between male and female subjects. A linear regression analysis revealed that circulating \{MAIT\} cell levels declined annually by 3.2% among men and 1.8% among women, respectively. Notably, the proportion of \{CD4\} + \{MAIT\} cells increased with age, whereas that of \{CD8\} + \{MAIT\} cells decreased with age. In addition, the production of interleukin (IL)-4 by \{MAIT\} cells was found to be significantly increased in elderly subjects and the ratio of interferon (IFN)-?/IL-4 was lower as compared with young subjects, showing a Th1 to Th2 shift in cytokine profile in elderly subjects. Our data suggest that aging is associated with a reduction in circulating \{MAIT\} cells, accompanied with alterations in subset composition and cytokine profile. "

As well as this, the number of elderly people has increased significantly in the last 15 years and these people are often treated in-home and at times enter into a critical situation that may require help (e.g. when facing an accident, or becoming depressed). Advances in ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided efficient and cheap equipments that include wireless communication and cameras, such as smartphones or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi. Embedded computing enables the deployment of Health Smart Homes (HSH) that can enhance in-home medical treatment. The use of camera and image processing on IoT is still an application that has not been fully explored in the literature, especially in the context of HSH. Although use of images has been widely exploited to address issues such as safety and surveillance in the house, they have been little employed to assist patients and/or elderly people as part of the home-care systems. In our view, these images can help nurses or caregivers to assist patients in need of timely help, and the implementation of this application can be extremely easy and cheap when aided by IoT technologies. This article discusses the use of patient images and emotional detection to assist patients and elderly people within an in-home healthcare context. We also discuss the existing literature and show that most of the studies in this area do not make use of images for the purpose of monitoring patients. In addition, there are few studies that take into account the patient’s emotional state, which is crucial for them to be able to recover from a disease. Finally, we outline our prototype which runs on multiple computing platforms and show results that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. "

Methods This version was obtained with forward/backward translations and pre-testing. The Arabic KOOS, the RAND-36-Item Health Survey (RAND-36) questionnaire, visual analogue scales (VAS) of pain and a form for patient characteristics were used. Test–retest reliability and internal consistency were assessed, using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. The dimensionality was assessed, by factor analysis and construct validity by using a priori hypothesized correlations with the RAND-36. Ceiling/floor effects and measurement error were tested as well. Results No major difficulties were encountered during the translation and pre-testing stages. Reliability was acceptable with Cronbach's alpha coefficients between 0.80 and 0.95, and \{ICCs\} ranging from 0.88 to 0.96 for the \{KOOS\} subscales. Factor analysis was performed on the whole study population and the results indicated that all items of the Arabic \{KOOS\} loaded on one factor, which ranged from 0.34 to 0.89. Construct validity was supported by the confirmation of all priori hypotheses by the presence of higher correlations between similar constructs than between dissimilar constructs of the \{KOOS\} subscales, RAND-36 subscales and VAS. Floor/ceiling effects were considered not to be present. Conclusion The Arabic \{KOOS\} is a reliable and valid instrument that can be self-administered to Egyptian patients and provides a valuable basis for research and clinical projects focussing on patient-based assessments in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), meniscus and combined injures of knee. Further studies to validate the Arabic version of the \{KOOS\} using females and elderly population with different knee problems and various educational levels in other Arabic counties are highly recommended.

Young (n = 35; 27.0 ± 7.7 years) and elderly (n = 38; 67.3 ± 8.7 years) healthy volunteers maintained an undisturbed standing position during postural tasks characterized by combined sensory (vision/no vision) and biomechanical challenges (feet apart/together). A method for the analysis of three-dimensional statokinesigrams based on nonparametric statistics and image-processing analysis was employed. Four patterns of spatial distribution were derived from ankle and hip strategies according to the quantity (single; double; multi) and location (anteroposterior; mediolateral) of high-density regions on three-dimensional statokinesigrams. Significant associations between postural task and spatial pattern were observed (young: gamma = 0.548, p &lt; .001; elderly: gamma = 0.582, p &lt; .001). Robustness analysis revealed small changes related to parameter choices for histogram processing. \{MANOVA\} revealed multivariate main effects for postural task [Wilks’ Lambda = 0.245, p &lt; .001] and age [Wilks’ Lambda = 0.308, p &lt; .001], with interaction [Wilks’ Lambda = 0.732, p &lt; .001]. The quantity of high-density regions was positively correlated to stabilogram and statokinesigram variables (p &lt; .05 or lower). In conclusion, postural tasks are associated with center of pressure spatial patterns and are similar in young and elderly healthy volunteers. Single-centered patterns reflected more stable postural conditions and were more frequent with complete visual input and a wide base of support. "

Taking advantage of the popularity, portability, and inherent technology of smartphones, we present an emergency application for smartphones, designated as knock-to-panic (KTP). This innovative and novel system enables users to simply hit their devices in order to send an alarm signal to an emergency service. This application is a complete and autonomous emergency system, and can provide an economic, reliable, and unobtrusive method for elderly monitoring or safety protection. Moreover, the simple and fast activation of \{KTP\} makes it a viable and potentially superior alternative to traditional ambient assisted living emergency calls. Furthermore, \{KTP\} can be further extended to the general population as well and not just be limited for elderly persons. The proposed method is a threshold-based algorithm and is designed to require a low battery power consumption. The evaluation of the performance of the algorithm in collected data indicates that both sensitivity and specificity are above 90%. "

Test usability and reliability was examined in terms of acceptability, stability and reliability. Of 150 participants (age: 63.6 ± 5.6, range 55–83 years), 143 (95%) successfully completed a valid baseline test. Of these, 67% completed 3 month and 43% 12 months of testing. Technical difficulties were reported by 9% of participants. For those participants who completed 12 months tests, all tasks showed moderate to high stability and test–retest reliability. This brief computerized test battery was shown to have high acceptability for baseline self-administered testing and moderate to high stability for repeated assessments over 12 months. Attrition was high between baseline and 3 months. These data suggest that this tool may be useful for high frequency monitoring of cognitive function over 6–12 months, and deserves further evaluation. "

abstract = "Abstract The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin functions as a key neurotransmitter at both terminals of this network. Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for the gut microbiome in regulating normal functioning of this axis. In particular, it is becoming clear that the microbial influence on tryptophan metabolism and the serotonergic system may be an important node in such regulation. There is also substantial overlap between behaviours influenced by the gut microbiota and those which rely on intact serotonergic neurotransmission. The developing serotonergic system may be vulnerable to differential microbial colonisation patterns prior to the emergence of a stable adult-like gut microbiota. At the other extreme of life, the decreased diversity and stability of the gut microbiota may dictate serotonin-related health problems in the elderly. The mechanisms underpinning this crosstalk require further elaboration but may be related to the ability of the gut microbiota to control host tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway, thereby simultaneously reducing the fraction available for serotonin synthesis and increasing the production of neuroactive metabolites. The enzymes of this pathway are immune and stress-responsive, both systems which buttress the brain-gut axis. In addition, there are neural processes in the gastrointestinal tract which can be influenced by local alterations in serotonin concentrations with subsequent relay of signals along the scaffolding of the brain-gut axis to influence \{CNS\} neurotransmission. Therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota might be a viable treatment strategy for serotonin-related brain-gut axis disorders. "

In sociology, minority means the same as subordinate, and dominant is used interchangeably with majority. A minority group has five properties: unequal treatment, distinguishing physical or cultural traits, involuntary membership, awareness of subordination, and in-group marriage. Minority groups typically emerge through migration, annexation, and colonialism. The social consequences for minorities include extermination, expulsion, secession, segregation, fusion, and assimilation. Pluralism offers an alternative to complete societal dominance over minorities. Primarily through occupying an economic niche as self-employed entrepreneurs, middleman minorities provide desired services and sometimes products of use to both the majority and other minorities. Most typically, the term ‘minorities’ has been used to describe racial, ethnic or national, and religious minorities residing in a nation-state with a clearly defined majority (dominant) group.

Methods After controlling the long-time and seasonal trend, weather, air pollution and other confounding factors, a semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the exposure–effect relationship between \{DTR\} and daily \{ER\} admissions among elderly adults with different lag structures from 2009 to 2011 in Beijing. We examined the effects of \{DTR\} for stratified groups by age and gender, and conducted the modifying effect of season on \{DTR\} to test the possible interaction. Results Significant associations were found between \{DTR\} and four major causes of daily \{ER\} admissions among elderly adults in Beijing. A 1 °C increase in the 8-day moving average of \{DTR\} (lag 07) corresponded to an increase of 2.08% (95% CI: 0.88%–3.29%) in respiratory \{ER\} admissions and 2.14% (95% CI: 0.71%–3.59%) in digestive \{ER\} admissions. A 1 °C increase in the 3-day and 6-day moving average of \{DTR\} (lag 02 and lag 05) corresponded to a 0.76% (95% CI: 0.07%–1.46%) increase in cardiovascular \{ER\} admissions, and 1.81% (95% CI: 0.21%–3.45%) increase in genitourinary \{ER\} admissions, respectively. The people aged 75 years and older were associated more strongly with \{DTR\} than the 65–74 age group. The modifying effect of season on \{DTR\} was observed and it was various in four causes. Conclusions This study strengthens the evidence that \{DTR\} is an independent risk factor for \{ER\} admissions among elderly persons. Some prevention programs that target the elderly and other high risk subgroups for impending large temperature changes may reduce the impact of \{DTR\} on people's health. "

abstract = "We review sex differences in the relationship between habitual physical activity and health in the elderly, with particular reference to pedometer/accelerometer data from the Nakanojo Study. Maximal aerobic power, walking speed and habitual physical activity are 10–30% greater in men than in women. This reflects not only biological but also socio-cultural and environmental factors, with the latter becoming dominant as age advances. It implies a need for sex-specific thresholds of moderate activity. Overall health is associated with both the year-averaged daily step count (the best indicator in women) and the year-averaged daily duration of physical activity &gt;3 metabolic equivalents (METs) (the best indicator in men). In both sexes, the threshold ranges of step count and/or duration of activity &gt;3 \{METs\} associated with a reduced prevalence of health problems are: 4000–5000 steps/day and/or 5–7.5 min/day for impaired mental and psychosocial health, such as a depressed mood state and a poor health-related quality of life; 7000–8000 steps/day and/or 15–20 min/day for markers of aortic arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia and poor physical fitness; and 8000–10,000 steps/day and/or 20–30 min/day for components of the metabolic syndrome, especially hypertension and hyperglycemia. Irrespective of sex, both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by stressful life events, such as a partner's death, and immediate meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature, underlining the need for long-term measurement of activity patterns. These findings have practical implications for those who engage in epidemiological studies and/or design health promotional programs for the elderly. "

However, despite the accuracy achieved by the current specialized systems there are constraints that limit quantitative gait analysis, for instance, the cost of the equipment, the limited access for many people and the lack of solutions to consistently monitor gait on a continuous basis. In this paper, two low-cost systems for quantitative gait analysis are presented, a wearable inertial system that relies on two wireless acceleration sensors mounted on the ankles; and a passive vision-based system that externally estimates the measurements through a structured light sensor and 3D point-cloud processing. Both systems are compared with a reference clinical instrument using an experimental protocol focused on the feasibility of estimating temporal gait parameters over two groups of healthy adults (five elders and five young subjects) under controlled conditions. The error of each system regarding the ground truth is computed. Inter-group and intra-group analyses are also conducted to transversely compare the performance between both technologies, and of these technologies with respect to the reference system. The comparison under controlled conditions is required as a previous stage towards the adaptation of both solutions to be incorporated into Ambient Assisted Living environments and to provide continuous in-home gait monitoring as part of the future work.

Spending in both programs has largely increased in the past decades — often more than the share of elderly in the population. We suggest that these phenomena may be due to political complementarities between these two transfer programs. We show that these two programs may coexist, because public health care may increase the political constituency in favor of social security, and vice-versa. Specifically, public health decreases the absolute longevity differential between low and high-income individuals, therefore rising the retirement period and the total pension benefits of the former relatively to the latter. This effect increases the political support for social security among the low-income young. We show that in a political equilibrium of a two-dimensional majoritarian election, a voting majority of low-income young and retirees supports a large welfare state; the composition between public health and social security is determined by intermediate (median) income types, who favor the contemporaneous existence of these two programs, since public health increases their longevity enough to make social security more attractive. Technological improvements in health care strengthens this complementarity and lead to more welfare spending. "

Para cubrir esta deficiencia se aportan los relativos a parámetros bioquímicos séricos en centenarios y nonagenarios de nuestro área geográfica. Material y métodos Dos grupos de individuos longevos procedentes de consultas del Hospital Universitario Río Hortega (Valladolid, España) han sido seleccionados: 30 centenarios y 80 nanogenarios sanos. Como grupo control se han sido incluidos 110 adultos sanos. Los parámetros de laboratorio han sido determinados utilizando sistemas automatizados. Para el análisis de las diferencias significativas entre las medias ha sido utilizado un análisis de varianza a fin de determinar si los niveles medios de 20 parámetros eran diferentes en los dos grupos anteriores. Adicionalmente, ha sido realizado un análisis factorial para ubicar variables y casos en gráficos 3 D. Resultados En individuos centenarios han sido observadas diferencias significativas para las concentraciones séricas de proteínas totales, colesterol, alanino-aminotransferasa, gamma-glutamiltransferasa y ácido fólico (disminuidas respecto a controles) y para las de urea, ácido úrico, homocisteína y ferritina (aumentadas). En nonagenarios solo han sido encontradas diferencias significativas para urea (aumentada), proteínas totales y colesterol (disminuidas). En centenarios ha sido hallado un alto coeficiente de correlación (r2 = 0,86) al asociar la fosfatasa alcalina a la bilirrubina. Para ambos colectivos las concentraciones séricas de homocisteína y vitamina \{B12\} han correlacionado inversamente (r2 = 0,88). Conclusión En nonagenarios, para todas las determinaciones excepto urea, proteínas totales y colesterol, pueden utilizarse como valores de referencia los de los adultos sanos. En centenarios, las significativas variaciones frente a controles que aparecen para la mitad de las determinaciones estudiadas y en especial para los parámetros urea, ácido úrico, proteínas totales, colesterol, alanino-aminotransferasa, gamma-glutamil transferasa, homocisteína, ácido fólico y ferritina hacen aconsejable disponer de intervalos propios.

However, evaluating the \{UX\} of \{AAL\} technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the \{UX\} of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis \{UX\} evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the \{UX\} of older adults using a neural network that take as input the \{EEG\} signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional \{UX\} evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results. "

These have manifested themselves in many ways, both in terms of lifestyle (e.g. personal wealth, health and life-expectancy; work-practices and leisure) as well as the character of the food supply. Developments in food technology have usually been in response to scientific developments and/or changes in either lifestyle or the food supply. Meeting the gastronomic needs of different lifestyles is not a new phenomenon. After all, the sandwich was developed to provide sustenance for a sedentary eighteenth century gambler! Changes in the quality of life have also provided new challenges in terms of public health. In many societies, the principal challenges to public health now concern chronic diseases and infirmities associated with old age. Personal diet is a significant risk factor in many of these conditions. In addition to changes at the level of the individual, public attitudes to their social responsibilities have also changed. This has led to the development of substantial national budgets both for medical services and care of the elderly. All of these developments have resulted in increasing pressure to provide frameworks within which the consumer can exercise the dietary choice to reduce their risk of illness. Such frameworks place pressure on the innovative skills of the food industry to provide a diverse range of foods compatible with the consumers' lifestyles and which enable appropriate personal choice to be made for a healthy diet.

Methods This study is a cross-sectional survey of gambling habits. A random sample of older adults with a scheduled primary-care clinic appointment was selected and screened with the General Health Questionnaire and questions about suicidality and alcohol use. Also, participants were asked about their gambling habits. Results Of 843 screened patients completing the gambling questionnaire, 69.6% reported that they had participated in at least one gambling activity in the last year. At-risk gamblers were defined as those who reported having bet more than $100 on a single bet and/or having bet more than they could afford to lose in the last year. Of those responding, 10.9% were identified as at-risk gamblers. The strongest predictors of at-risk gambling behavior were being a binge drinker, presence of current posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, minority race/ethnicity, and being a \{VA\} clinic patient. Subjects with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment were just as likely as those without impairment to gamble and to report at-risk gambling behavior. At-risk gambling behavior was not significantly associated with gender, current or past depressive symptoms, or cigarette smoking. Conclusions These data raise a significant public health concern that gambling behaviors are prevalent in older adults. Additional research is needed to further define the determinants of gambling behavior in older adults and evaluate the social, health, and economic costs and benefits of gambling by older adults, especially among those groups determined to be at risk.

Because age-associated differences in cytokine profiles have been described, patients and healthy individuals were divided into two age groups: up to 65 years and over 65 years. Results Our results showed that plasma TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in \{AML\} patients from both groups of age. IL-8 was increased in \{AML\} patients less than 65 years while the plasma concentrations of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-12p70 were significantly higher only in elderly \{AML\} patients compared with aged-matched healthy controls. Moreover, plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were associated with patient survival and event-free survival. Conclusions An aberrant production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is observed in \{AML\} patients. Low levels of IL-6 and high levels of IL-10 represent favorable prognostic factors for survival in \{AML\} patients. These results support the idea that cytokine deregulation may be useful as a marker for predicting clinical evolution in \{AML\} patients. "

Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded during a continuous recognition memory task performance.

In comparison with healthy controls, \{MCI\} subjects showed increased theta (p &lt; 0.001), lower beta reduction (p &lt; 0.001) and decreased alpha and gamma power (p &lt; 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively) in frontal, temporal and parietal areas during early and late latencies.

Man must keep the muscular part of himself in correct condition as 32% of the body–mind is muscle; however, if gluttony has induced obesity, the percentage falls. The voluntary muscles induce movement by acting on the levers and the bones, which are joined together by the joints and the ligaments. If health is desired, then first of all a man must limit himself to the minimum of energy intake for the total activity that he must put out so that no energy shall be left over to do harm, for any unwanted energy can do nothing else but harm; by adequate activities, he must get his locomotor system back to full efficiency by correct use in all ways, and he must regain the lost suppleness of foot and spinal joints. It is strongly advisable not to commit exercise by the elderly person. For real activity in elderly people, without danger to life, two things are essential and need to be kept in mind, no inner stenches and at least two inches of basal chest motility. "

Serum was collected prior to vaccination and 4–8 weeks later, and analyzed for IgG antibody levels to pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F by ELISA. Functional antibody activity towards pneumococcal serotypes 4 and 14 was measured using an opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPA). Results All patient groups had lower pre-vaccination IgG antibody and \{OPA\} titers to the investigated serotypes compared to the healthy controls. Following vaccination, myeloma patients responded with significant IgG titer increases to 1/7 serotypes and \{OPA\} titer increases to 1/2 serotypes. Corresponding IgG and \{OPA\} vaccine responses were 3/7 and 0/2 for Waldenstrom patients, 4/7 and 1/2 for \{MGUS\} patients, and 4/7 and 2/2 for the healthy controls, respectively. Notably high antibody levels without corresponding \{OPA\} titers were seen among a few myeloma patients indicating the presence of non-functional antibodies. Neither of the two vaccines elicited significantly higher serotype-specific IgG concentrations, \{OPA\} titers or antibody fold increases in any of the study groups. Hypogammaglobulinemia and ongoing chemotherapy were associated with poor vaccine responses in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion Our findings confirm that B cell malignancies and disorders among elderly patients are associated with suboptimal responses to pneumococcal vaccination. Single-dose \{PCV7\} was not shown to be superior to PPV. "

In this study we investigated differences in physical activity levels, stress levels, and immune biomarkers in young versus elderly participants. We then looked for associations between physical activity and stress with immune biomarkers. 19 young adults (18–45 yrs) and 19 gender-, race-, and BMI-matched elderly adults (&gt;60 yrs) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS), and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S/T), and donated blood for assessment of CD4+ T cell biomarkers. The elderly group had significantly lower scores on the PSS, BDI-FS, STAIS, and STAIT; had a tendency to engage in more hours of moderate physical activities each week; and had a significantly higher Tr1 and a significantly lower Th3 compared to the young group. Age significantly moderated the relationship between physical activity and both Tr1 cells and \{IFNgamma\} production. For the stress measures, age significantly moderated the relationship between Th3 cells and depression. These data show that immune biomarkers in elderly people may be affected differently by exercise and stress compared to young people. "

This adverse health effect is suggested to be mediated by inflammatory processes. The purpose of this study was to determine if low levels of particulate matter, typical for smaller cities, are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Fifty-two elderly individuals with ischemic heart disease were followed for six months with biweekly clinical visits in the city of Kotka, Finland. Blood samples were collected for the determination of inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon (IFN)?, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase and white blood cell count. Particle number concentration and fine particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5)) as well as thoracic particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters &lt;10 µm (PM10)) mass concentration were measured daily at a fixed outdoor measurement site. Light-absorbance of PM2.5 filter samples, an indicator of combustion derived particles, was measured with a smoke-stain reflectometer. In addition, personal exposure to PM2.5 was measured with portable photometers. During the study period, wildfires in Eastern Europe led to a 12-day air pollution episode, which was excluded from the main analyses. Average ambient PM2.5 concentration was 8.7 µg/m3. Of the studied pollutants, PM2.5 and absorbance were most strongly associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers; most notably with C-reactive protein and IL-12 within a few days of exposure. There was also some evidence of an effect of particulate air pollution on fibrinogen and myeloperoxidase. The concentration of IL-12 was considerably (227%) higher during than before the forest fire episode. These findings show that even low levels of particulate air pollution from urban sources are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Also particles from wildfires may exhibit pro-inflammatory effects. "

Inflamm-aging, i.e. chronic low-grade inflammation during aging, is commonly characterized by pro-inflammatory biomarkers. However, most studies use just one marker at a time, sometimes leading to conflicting results due to complex interactions among the markers. A multidimensional approach allows a more robust interpretation of the various relationships between the markers. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to 19 inflammatory biomarkers from the InCHIANTI study. We identified a clear, stable structure among the markers, with the first axis explaining inflammatory activation (both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers loaded strongly and positively) and the second axis innate immune response. The first but not the second axis was strongly correlated with age (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.08 p = 0.053), and both were strongly predictive of mortality (hazard ratios per \{PCA\} unit (95% CI): 1.33 (1.16–1.53) and 0.87 (0.76–0.98) respectively) and multiple chronic diseases, but in opposite directions. Both axes were more predictive than any individual markers for baseline chronic diseases and mortality. These results show that \{PCA\} can uncover a novel biological structure in the relationships among inflammatory markers, and that key axes of this structure play important roles in chronic disease.

There is little information on the timely administration of birth dose vaccines. The objective of this study was to assess the timing of birth dose vaccines (hepatitis B, \{BCG\} and oral polio) and reasons for delayed administration in The Gambia. Methods We used vaccination data from the Farafenni Health and Demographic Surveillance System (FHDSS) between 2004 and 2014. Coverage was calculated at birth (0–1 day), day 7, day 28, 6 months and 1 year of age. Logistic regression models were used to identify demographic and socio-economic variables associated with vaccination by day 7 in children born between 2011 and 2014. Results Most of the 10,851 children had received the first dose of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine by the age of 6 months (93.1%). Nevertheless, only 1.1% of them were vaccinated at birth, 5.4% by day 7, and 58.4% by day 28. Vaccination by day 7 was associated with living in urban areas (West rural: adjusted \{OR\} (AOR) = 6.13, 95%CI: 3.20–11.75, east rural: \{AOR\} = 6.72, 95%CI: 3.66–12.33) and maternal education (senior-educations: \{AOR\} = 2.43, 95%CI: 1.17–5.06); and inversely associated with distance to vaccination delivery points (?2 km: \{AOR\} = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.24–0.70), and Fula ethnicity (AOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.40–0.91). Conclusion Vaccine coverage in The Gambia is high but infants are usually vaccinated after the neonatal period.

Study design A total of 1741 people =65 years of age participated in this cross-sectional study. Main outcome measures Upper- and lower-limbs maximal voluntary isometric strength was obtained using standardized techniques and equipment. \{PA\} was recorded by a validated questionnaire. The associations of \{PA\} with strength were assessed using generalized linear regression models with a Gamma-distributed dependent variable. Results A significant gender by \{PA\} interaction was found for all strength-related variables (all P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, when sexual hormones, albumin or C-Reactive protein were taken into account in the model, the results did not significantly change. In women, \{PA\} was positively associated with upper and lower-body strength; however in men, \{PA\} was only associated with grip and knee strength (both P &lt; 0.01). Higher strength values were associated with higher levels of PA, especially in women. However, this tendency had a different pattern across the age range, showing a stronger association in the ‘young’ elderly compared with the ‘old’ elderly. Conclusion Higher levels of \{PA\} are related to greater muscle strength, especially in women and those who were younger. "

Interventions Warm-up exercises and Wii Fit training that involved training motor (shifts centre of gravity and step alternation) and cognitive skills. A follow-up evaluative Wii Fit session was held 60 days after the end of training. Participants performed a functional reach test before and after training as a measure of learning transfer. Main outcome measures Learning and retention were determined based on the scores of 10 Wii Fit games over eight sessions. Transfer of learning was assessed after training using the functional reach test. Results Patients with Parkinson's disease showed no deficit in learning or retention on seven of the 10 games, despite showing poorer performance on five games compared with the healthy elderly group. Patients with Parkinson's disease showed marked learning deficits on three other games, independent of poorer initial performance. This deficit appears to be associated with cognitive demands of the games which require decision-making, response inhibition, divided attention and working memory. Finally, patients with Parkinson's disease were able to transfer motor ability trained on the games to a similar untrained task. Conclusions The ability of patients with Parkinson's disease to learn, retain and transfer performance improvements after training on the Nintendo Wii Fit depends largely on the demands, particularly cognitive demands, of the games involved, reiterating the importance of game selection for rehabilitation purposes.

Our study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of air pollutants including PM10, NO2, SO2, and \{O3\} on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the largest city in Vietnam. Data on hospitalization from the two largest hospitals in \{HCMC\} and daily records of PM10, NO2, SO2, \{O3\} and meteorological data were collected from February 2004 to December 2007. A time-series regression analysis with distributed lag model was applied for data analysis. Changes in levels of \{NO2\} and \{PM10\} were strongly associated with hospital admissions for both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVD); whereas levels of \{SO2\} were only moderately associated with respiratory and \{CVD\} hospital admissions and \{O3\} concentration was not associated with any of them. For a 10 µg/m3 increase of each air pollutant, the risk of respiratory admissions increased from 0.7% to 8% while the risk of \{CVD\} admissions increased from 0.5% to 4%. Females were found to be more sensitive than males to exposure to air pollutants in regard to respiratory diseases. In regard to CVD, females (RR, 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01–1.07) had a slightly higher risk of admissions than males (RR, 1.03, 95% CI, 1–1.06) to exposure to NO2.

Exercise stimulates important key stress signals that control skeletal mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Perturbations in mitochondrial content and function can directly or indirectly impact skeletal muscle function and consequently whole-body health and wellbeing. Scope of review This review will describe the exercise-stimulated stress signals and molecular mechanisms positively regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and function. It will then discuss the major myopathies, neuromuscular diseases and conditions such as diabetes and ageing that have dysregulated mitochondrial function. Finally, the impact of exercise and potential pharmacological approaches to improve mitochondrial function in diseased populations will be discussed. Major conclusions Exercise activates key stress signals that positively impact major transcriptional pathways that transcribe genes involved in skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion and metabolism. The positive impact of exercise is not limited to younger healthy adults but also benefits skeletal muscle from diseased populations and the elderly. Impaired mitochondrial function can directly influence skeletal muscle atrophy and contribute to the risk or severity of disease conditions. Pharmacological manipulation of exercise-induced pathways that increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and function in critically ill patients, where exercise may not be possible, may assist in the treatment of chronic disease. General significance This review highlights our understanding of how exercise positively impacts skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Exercise not only improves skeletal muscle mitochondrial health but also enables us to identify molecular mechanisms that may be attractive targets for therapeutic manipulation.

A retrospective study was made of 21 patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture in 1995-2001. The series included 2 men and 19 women, mean age 101 years (range 100 to 105 years). There were 8 right fractures and 13 left fractures, 6 subcapital fractures (including 2 impacted fractures), 14 intertrochanteric fractures, and 1 subtrochanteric fracture. There were no open fractures. The mean wait for surgery was 3.5 days and the mean duration of the hospital stay was 18.8 days (9 to 35 days). The most common mechanism of injury was an accidental fall. Bone fixation was achieved with 13 short Gamma nails, 1 long Gamma nail, 4 Moore hemiarthroplasties, 2 \{AO\} cannulated screws, and 1 Ender nail. The Barthel scale was used to assess results at admission and discharge, preoperative and postoperative complications during admission, and survival. The comorbidity index was 3.4. The mean Barthel index was 37.2 at admission and 25.3 at release. Two patients died during admission, 4 in the first year, 5 between 12 and 24 months, and 3 more than 24 months later. Three patients are still alive, 1 confined to bed and a chair and 2 using walkers. The remaining 4 patients could not be located after hospital discharge and were lost to follow-up. The mean survival was 17.7 months (0.5 to 48 months). The increased prevalence of persons over 85 years old as well as the poor bone quality that is inevitably found in such patients leads to a high index of hip fractures, which is a serious social and healthcare challenge to our institutions.

abstract = "The discovery of a coherent set of cortical regions showing activation during rest and deactivation during task performance has reignited an old debate in the field of neuroscience, one that questions the reflexivity of the human brain and provides evidence towards a more intrinsic functional architecture. The default-mode network (DMN) comprising of such consistent cortical regions has become a topic of increasing interest in both healthy and diseased populations. In this study, using a well-examined version of the verbal n-back task, interleaved with periods of rest blocks, we investigated whether the deactivation of the cortical regions comprising the \{DMN\} moderates individual differences in behavioral performance in a group of older adults. We recruited 25 young and 25 older adults for our study and presented them with blocks of the n-back task, with varying levels of load, interleaved with periods of fixation. A direct comparison of the young and older participants revealed both a reduction in the up-regulation of the prefrontal and parietal regions in response to increasing task demands, along with a reduction in the down-regulation of \{DMN\} regions with increasing cognitive load in the elderly. Better performance in the young adults was associated with the capability to modulate the regions of the working memory network with increasing task difficulty, however enhanced performance in the older cohort was associated with greater load-induced deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex. This study adds to the existing gamut of aging literature, providing evidence that \{DMN\} function is critical to cognitive functioning in older adults. "

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) interferes with memory formation from the molecular level, to synaptic functions and neural networks organization. Here, we determined whether brain connectivity of resting-state networks correlate with memory in patients affected by \{AD\} and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One hundred and forty-four subjects were recruited: 70 \{AD\} (MMSE Mini Mental State Evaluation 21.4), 50 \{MCI\} (MMSE 25.2) and 24 healthy subjects (MMSE 29.8). Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures to obtain Small World parameters. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity as extracted by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was used to weight the network. A high statistical correlation between Small World and memory performance was found. Namely, higher Small World characteristic in \{EEG\} gamma frequency band during the resting state, better performance in short-term memory as evaluated by the digit span tests. Such Small World pattern might represent a biomarker of working memory impairment in older people both in physiological and pathological conditions. "

Personal Travel Planning (PTP) was delivered to nearly every household in Thurrock over the past three-years. Each year, one third of the Borough was targeted for a door-to-door intervention and evaluated for evidence of mode shift towards more sustainable travel. Each year mode shift has been evidenced but in the final year, the eastern part of the Borough was targeted and found to have low car ownership and high deprivation and health inequalities, with a high proportion of elderly and disabled people, and high childhood obesity rates. This is not a typical audience for a \{PTP\} programme to create mode shift away from car trips, so some modifications to the approach would be required for it to be effective. Approach described To tailor the intervention to this audience’s needs, we identified an opportunity to intensify promotion of active travel options rather than a shift from car use as such. The result was a 27% increase in walking trips amongst participants, and a 4% increase in walking mode share (based on before and after surveys of travel habits). There was also evidence that some people drastically increased how often they walk, from walking never or very infrequently to walking every day. • This presentation covers two methods used to deliver these Results: Personal Travel Planning using Motivational Interviewing techniques from the health sector • ‘Beat the Street’, a community game to encourage walking, joint-funded with Public Health Structure of presentation The presentation will use multiple sources of evidence including quantitative evaluation tools and qualitative feedback and case studies, and cover the following key points: Background to the Travel Thurrock project, key objectives and challenges • Tailoring the programme to East Thurrock’s unique challenges following two successful years of modal shift from car trips to sustainable modes • Using Motivational Interviewing techniques to deliver mode shift to active travel, and how this is different from typical \{PTP\} programmes • Beat the Street and targeting the latent potential for active travel to school • Results, lessons learnt and practical applications for other interventions "

The lag is particularly noticeable in digital gaming and social networking.

Accordingly, selectors are more likely to make the same choices for themselves and stigmatized group member recipients than non-stigmatized group member recipients. We conducted eight studies to study this hypothesis in different choice contexts (food, music, games, books) and with recipients from different stigmatized groups (the obese, Black-Americans, the elderly, students at lower-status schools). We use three different approaches to show that this effect is driven by people’s desire to avoid offending stigmatized group members with their choices. Thus, although prior research shows that people often want to avoid being associated with dissociative groups, such as stigmatized groups, we demonstrate that people make the same choices for self and stigmatized other to minimize offense.

Methods Daily time-series analyses tested the association between daily air pollution and daily mortality in seven Chilean urban centers during the period January 1997–December 2007. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day-of-the week and humidex. Results Interquartile increases in particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and elemental and organic carbon were associated with a 4–7% increase in mortality among those who did not complete primary school (p&lt;0.05) vs. 0.5–1.5% among university graduates (p&gt;0.05). Among those at least 85 years of age respective estimates were 2–7%. However, among the elderly who did not complete primary school, respective estimates were 11–19% (p&lt;0.05). The degree of effect modification was less for income and employment status than education, and sex did not modify the results. Conclusion The socially disadvantaged, especially if elderly appear to be especially susceptible to dying on days of higher air pollution.

Single-marker associations and gene-by-smoking interactions with rate of change in \{FEV1\} and FEV1/FVC were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models, stratified by race/ethnicity. In European Americans, rs17883901 in \{GCLC\} was statistically significantly associated with rate of change in FEV1/FVC; the recessive genotype (TT) was associated with a 0.9% per year steeper decline (P = 4.50 × 10-5). Statistically significant gene-by-smoking interactions were observed for variants in two genes in European Americans: the minor allele of rs2297765 in mGST3 attenuated the accelerated decline in FEV1/FVC in smokers by 0.45% per year (P = 1.13 × 10-4); for participants with greater baseline smoking pack-years, the minor allele of rs2073192 in \{IDH3B\} was associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1/FVC (P = 2.10 × 10-4). For both genes, nominally significant interactions (P &lt; 0.01) were observed at the gene level in African Americans (P = 0.007 and 4.60 × 10-4, respectively). Nominally significant evidence of association was observed for variants in \{SOD3\} and \{GLRX2\} in multiple analyses. This study identifies two novel genes associated with longitudinal lung function phenotypes in both African and European Americans and confirms a prior finding for GCLC. These findings suggest novel mechanisms and molecular targets for future research and advance the understanding of genetic determinants of lung function and \{COPD\} risk. "

Social convention theory, first proposed by Mackie (1996), posits that in the context of extreme resource inequality, \{FGC\} emerged as a means of securing a better marriage by signaling fidelity, and subsequently spread to become a prerequisite for marriage for all women. Change is predicted to result from coordinated abandonment in intermarrying groups so as to preserve a marriage market for uncircumcised girls. While this theory fits well with many general observations of FGC, there have been few attempts to systematically test the theory. We use data from a three year mixed-method study of behavior change that began in 2004 in Senegal and The Gambia to explicitly test predictions generated by social convention theory. Analyses of 300 in-depth interviews, 28 focus group discussions, and survey data from 1220 women show that \{FGC\} is most often only indirectly related to marriageability via concerns over preserving virginity. Instead we find strong evidence for an alternative convention, namely a peer convention. We propose that being circumcised serves as a signal to other circumcised women that a girl or woman has been trained to respect the authority of her circumcised elders and is worthy of inclusion in their social network. In this manner, \{FGC\} facilitates the accumulation of social capital by younger women and of power and prestige by elder women. Based on this new evidence and reinterpretation of social convention theory, we suggest that interventions aimed at eliminating \{FGC\} should target women’s social networks, which are intergenerational, and include both men and women. Our findings support Mackie’s assertion that expectations regarding \{FGC\} are interdependent; change must therefore be coordinated among interconnected members of social networks. "

This study identified potential age-related defects in natural killer (NK) cell function during influenza infection. We showed that \{NK\} cells from aged mice were reduced and had impaired function and altered phenotype in lungs during influenza infection. Aged \{NK\} cells demonstrated decreased IFN-? production, but not degranulation, after influenza infection. However, after ex vivo activation with YAC-1 cells, aged \{NK\} cells demonstrated both reduced IFN-? production and degranulation. IFN-? was also reduced in aged \{NK\} cells after activation with anti-NKp46 and soluble cytokines. IFN-ß, and IL-12p40 mRNA expression was not significantly different from that observed in adult mice. Analysis of \{NK\} cell subsets indicated that aged mice had more immature and less terminally mature \{NK\} cells. These data suggest that aging affects the numbers, function and phenotype of \{NK\} cells. Thus, these defects in \{NK\} cell function could impair the ability of aged mice to induce a strong antiviral immune response during the early stages of the infection. "

Results We observed associations between \{TMX\} and \{ED\} visits for all internal causes, heat illness, fluid/electrolyte imbalances, renal diseases, asthma/wheeze, diabetes, and intestinal infections. Age groups with the strongest observed associations were 65+years for all internal causes [lag 0 \{RR\} (CI)=1.022 (1.016–1.028)] and diabetes [lag 0 RR=1.050 (1.008–1.095)]; 19–64 years for fluid/electrolyte imbalances [lag 0 RR=1.170 (1.136–1.205)] and renal disease [lag 1 RR=1.082 (1.065–1.099)]; and 5–18 years for asthma/wheeze [lag 2 RR=1.059 (1.030–1.088)] and intestinal infections [lag 1 RR=1.120 (1.041–1.205)]. Conclusions Varying strengths of associations between \{TMX\} and \{ED\} visits by age suggest that optimal interventions and health-impact projections would account for varying heat health impacts across ages.

With age, significant impairments have been reported in the two main mechanisms by which \{NK\} cells confer host protection: direct cytotoxicity and the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines. In elderly subjects, decreased \{NK\} cell activity has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence and severity of viral infection, highlighting the clinical implications that age-associated changes in \{NK\} cell biology have on the health of older adults. However, is an increased susceptibility to viral infection the only consequence of these age-related changes in \{NK\} cell function? Recently, evidence has emerged that has shown that in addition to eliminating transformed cells, \{NK\} cells are involved in many other biological processes such as immune regulation, anti-microbial immune responses and the recognition and elimination of senescent cells, novel functions that involve NK-mediated cytotoxicity and/or cytokine production. Thus, the decrease in \{NK\} cell function that accompanies physiological ageing is likely to have wider implications for the health of older adults than originally thought. Here, we give a detailed description of the changes in \{NK\} cell biology that accompany human ageing and propose that certain features of the ageing process such as: (i) the increased reactivation rates of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (ii) the slower resolution of inflammatory responses and (iii) the increased incidence of bacterial and fungal infection are attributable in part to an age-associated decline in \{NK\} cell function.

Acute respiratory tract infections are very common during Hajj, primarily as a result of close contact among pilgrims, intense congestion, shared accommodation and air pollution. A number of vaccines are (or have been) recommended for Hajj pilgrims in recent years. Several additional vaccines could significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality at Hajj and should be considered in health recommendations for pilgrims. Pneumococcal vaccines (particularly for those aged &gt;65 years) are widely available, and have been shown to reduce the burden of disease associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Importantly, a considerable percentage of Hajj pilgrims have pre-existing illnesses or are elderly, both important risk factors for pneumococcal infection. While there are substantial gaps that need to be addressed regarding our knowledge of the exact burden of disease in Hajj pilgrims and the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in this population, S. pneumoniae may be an important cause of illness among this group of travelers. It can be assumed that the majority of pneumococcal serotypes circulating during Hajj are included in the existing pneumococcal vaccines. "

Forty-seven healthy older adults (women = 24, men = 23; mean age 68.2 years) participated in a exercise intervention (60 min/session) that included resistance exercise training (2 days/week) at 75–80% of maximum plus a multicomponent weight-bearing impact exercise training (1 day/week). Outcome measures included lumbar spine and proximal femoral BMD, dynamic balance, muscle strength, serum levels of bone metabolism markers [osteocalcin (OC), C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)] and serum levels of inflammatory markers [high sensitive (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interferon (IFN)-?].

In addition, hs-CRP and IFN-? levels were decreased, while TNF-a levels were unchanged, and a decrease in IL-6 levels was only observed in men. These findings suggest that our combined impact protocol reduces inflammation and increases BMD, balance, and lower-extremity muscle strength, despite having little effect on bone metabolism markers. This reinforces the role of exercise to counteract the age-related inflammation, and the muscle strength, balance and \{BMD\} reduction. "

Our findings indicate that the use of tangible play in combination with a guessing element in a tabletop game does indeed facilitate social interaction and adds to the aspect of fun. Our results also indicate that senior citizens found the electronic tabletop version of the game to be more immersive and absorbing, as compared to a static paper version. Analyzing the non-verbal behavior of both older adults and children, it was concluded that players were socially more engaged with their opponents than with their team members. This effect was more pronounced in the case of children. We also discuss some implications for social game design that can be deduced from the qualitative feedback provided by our participants. "

They consist in habitats augmented with sensors and actuators enabling to achieve activity recognition and to provide assistive services to a resident. Stationary aspect of sensors used in most smart homes makes the concept difficult to deploy in existing homes, and involves a high cost. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive non-vision-based system ably to recognize, in real-time, activities and errors of a resident. This proposed recognition system is based on a shoe equipped with a single sensor: a three-axis accelerometer and on a state- transition algorithmic approach using fuzzy logic. We have examined the learning data as frequency distributions, where the probability histograms have been directly interpreted as fuzzy set. We conducted experiments of the system in our smart home by simulating (multiple times) several scenarios based on a morning routine. These scenarios were based on clinical data gathered in a previous experiment with actual Alzheimer's patients. We obtained promising results showing that the proposed activity and error recognition system are highly effective. "

We aimed to examine effects of ambient temperatures on city-/gender-/age-/education-specific diabetes mortality in nine Chinese cities using a two-stage analysis. Distributed lag non-linear model was first applied to estimate the city-specific non-linear and delayed effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality. Pooled effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality were then obtained using meta-analysis, based on restricted maximum likelihood. We found that heat effects were generally acute and followed by a period of mortality displacement, while cold effects could last for over two weeks. The pooled relative risks of extreme high (99th percentile of temperature) and high temperature (90th percentile of temperature) were 1.29 (95%CI: 1.11–1.47) and 1.11 (1.03–1.19) over lag 0–21 days, compared with the 75th percentile of temperature. In contrast, the pooled relative risks over lag 0–21 days were 1.44 (1.25–1.66) for extreme low (1st percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (1.12–1.30) for low temperature (10th percentile of temperature), compared to 25th percentile of temperature. The estimate of heat effects was relatively higher among females than that among males, with opposite trend for cold effects, and the estimates of heat and cold effects were particularly higher among the elderly and those with low education, although the differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). These findings have important public health implications for protecting diabetes patients from adverse ambient temperatures. "

This paper presents the experience from a study that stimulates the social media elements existing in the learning environment, and reinforces the use of various techniques intended to enable focused online collaboration and knowledge acquisition. In order to support cutting edge learning, the approach stimulates a pervasive access to scholarly articles, breaking news existing online, and open educational resources. The study has been performed for almost a decade in computer ethics courses attended by senior undergraduates from the University of Skopje, Macedonia, and junior graduates from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. The paper exhaustively overviews the simulation of the social media inclusion in the learning process, as well as the activities performed during its execution. The subjective student impression of all implemented techniques is contrasted with the teacher estimated amount of acquired knowledge. The paper also emphasizes the benefits of the implemented approach, suggestions to educationalists intending to employ it themselves, and finally the intentions of the further inclusion of social media in educational technologies.

As the current generation of polysaccharide vaccines do not provide sufficient protection for elderly, new vaccination strategies are urgently needed. To learn whether pneumococcal proteins are able to induce adaptive immune responses in adults in different age groups, we determined serum IgG antibody titers and T cell immunity (IFN-?, IL-17A and IL-5 production) to three pneumococcal antigens, PcsB, StkP and PsaA, that are components of an investigational protein-based pneumococcal vaccine, IC47. Therefore, sera and \{PBMCs\} of 108 healthy adults in three different age groups (young, middle-aged and elderly) were analyzed by \{ELISA\} and ELISpot, respectively. We found naturally acquired antibodies to all three proteins in all age groups against all three antigens. However, elderly individuals had significantly lower IgG levels to PcsB and PsaA compared to those of younger donors. There was no significant age-related difference in the overall rate of T cell immunity for the three pneumococcal proteins. We found that the Th17 response was dominant in all age groups and was frequently combined with a Th1 or Th2 response in young and middle-aged subjects. However, in elderly persons there was a lower percentage of \{PBMC\} samples producing more than one cytokine upon antigenic stimulation. The narrow cytokine secretion pattern was the most striking difference between elderly and younger adult age groups. Our results demonstrate that in the majority of adults there is a naturally acquired humoral and cellular immune response to the three pneumococcal proteins tested. The dominance of the Th17 response is especially interesting in the light of new insights regarding the role of Th17 cells in mucosal protection against this pathogen. "

Our study investigated the relationship between indoor temperature and heat-related health problems of elderly individuals. Material and methods The study was conducted in the Netherlands between April and August 2012. Temperature and relative humidity were measured continuously in the living rooms and bedrooms of 113 elderly individuals. Respondents were asked to fill out an hourly diary during three weeks with high temperature and one cold reference week, and a questionnaire at the end of these weeks, on health problems that they experienced due to heat. Results During the warmest week of the study period (14–20 August), average living room and bedroom temperatures were approximately 5 °C higher than during the reference week. More than half of the respondents perceived their indoor climate as too warm during this week. The most reported symptoms were thirst (42.7%), sleep disturbance (40.6%) and excessive sweating (39.6%). There was a significant relationship between both indoor and outdoor temperatures with the number of hours that heat-related health problems were reported per day. For an increase of 1 °C of indoor temperature, annoyance due to heat and sleep disturbance increased with 33% and 24% respectively. Outdoor temperature was associated with smaller increases: 13% and 11% for annoyance due to heat and sleep disturbance, respectively. The relationship between outdoor temperature and heat-related health problems disappeared when indoor and outdoor temperatures were included in one model. Conclusions The relationship with heat-related health problems in the elderly is stronger with indoor (living room and bedroom) temperature than with outdoor temperature. This should be taken into account when looking for measures to reduce heat exposure in this vulnerable group. "

Methods Time-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis. Results A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% \{CI\} 3.10–3.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.18–4.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.06–2.75) mortality. A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84–3.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19–2.14) mortality. The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20–12.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54–8.44). A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity. Discussion Elevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes.

Among the elderly, the high dose vaccine induced greater \{HAI\} (hemagglutination inhibition) and virus neutralization antibody titers than the standard dose vaccine.

On the other hand, the standard dose vaccine in the elderly resulted in the highest proportion of complete non-responders who failed to elicit either an \{HAI\} or an IFN-? response.

It can contribute strongly to disability, impaired well-being and excessive use of the health services. In the elderly, depression often occurs in conjunction with other medical illnesses and disabilities, and lasts longer. Furthermore, the elderly often display the symptoms of depression differently. Depression also increases the risk of suicide, especially among elderly white men, with a suicide rate in people aged 80 to 84 more than twice that of the general population. The under-diagnosis and under-treatment of depression in older adults has been well documented. In general, effective treatment for depression in the elderly is thought to be the same as for younger patients. Most of the available antidepressants are believed to be equally effective in elderly adults. However, antidepressants may take longer to start working in older people than they do in younger people. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, problem-solving treatment, and interpersonal therapy have the strongest evidence base for treating patients with late-life depression. Finally, particular attention should be paid to complicated grief in late life. In later life, losses commonly include spouses, siblings, and peers, and less commonly adult children and grandchildren. In case of complicated grief, the griever remains preoccupied with reminders of the reality of their loss that are persistent, severe, and pervasive, giving the griever a sense of being stuck in their grief beyond 6 months, and sometimes for decades after the death has occurred. Complicated grief must be taken seriously and treated appropriately. "

People 65 years of age or older already constitute approximately one eighth of the U.S. population; this proportion is expected to double in the next 50 years. Older Americans have their own population-specific health challenges, such as Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, adult-onset diabetes, prostate cancer, menopause, and hypertension. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are seldom discussed within this community. Prevention, counseling, testing, and education efforts are not being directed their way. In addition, few practitioners are experts both in \{HIV\} and health problems associated with aging, resulting in misdiagnosis, especially in the early stages when \{AIDS\} symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and diminished appetite are dismissed as part of the aging process. Very few HIV-related social support services have been aimed at the needs of the elderly, perhaps because older Americans are not suspected to be sexually active or are assumed to be in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship. Older Americans are not suspected of drug use. Yet many are sexually active, often demonstrating risky sexual behavior, such as dispensing with the use of condoms; and the isolation that frequently accompanies old age can lead to alcoholism and injectable drug use. This article examines methods suggested in the literature both in terms of primary and secondary prevention of HIV/AIDS in older Americans. The cost of these efforts is enumerated, and organizations who gear their efforts in reaching and educating older Americans regarding their risks are described. "

The production of interferon (IFN)–? and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–a by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was measured by flow cytometry in peripheral blood obtained from subjects at different time points after \{AHCC\} intake. The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-? alone, TNF-a alone, or both increased during \{AHCC\} intake compared with baseline values. Furthermore, the frequency of such cells remained high even 30 days after discontinuing AHCC. Overall, these findings suggest that \{AHCC\} enhances CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses in healthy elderly persons taking at least 30 days to obtain such effect, which remained up to 30 days after discontinuing treatment with this compound.

This political system typically generates an intergenerational risk sharing scheme that is (i) larger, (ii) more persistent, and (iii) less responsive to the realization of the shock than the social optimum.

High-resolution city-specific climatologic \{A1B\} scenarios centered on 2020 and 2040 have been assessed. Generalized additive and distributed lag models have been used to identify the relationships between temperature and health outcomes stratified by age: general adults (&lt; 65), elderly (aged 65–74) and very elderly (= 75). The cumulative impact (over a lag-period of 30 days) of the effects of cold and especially heat, was mainly significant for mortality in the very elderly, with a higher impact on coastal plain than inland cities: 1 °C decrease/increase in temperature below/above the threshold was associated with a 2.27% (95% CI: 0.17–4.93) and 15.97% (95% CI: 7.43–24.51) change in mortality respectively in the coastal plain cities. A slight unexpected increase in short-term cold-related mortality in the very elderly, with respect to the baseline period, is predicted for the following years in half of the cities considered. Most cities also showed an extensive predicted increase in short-term heat-related mortality and a general increase in the annual temperature-related elderly mortality rate. These findings should encourage efforts to implement adaptation actions conducive to policy-making decisions, especially for planning short- and long-term health intervention strategies and mitigation aimed at preventing and minimizing the consequences of climate change on human health.

We survey participants in order to relate outcomes in the moonlighting game to demographic characteristics and traditional, survey-based measures of trust and trustworthiness and show that they are strongly correlated. Overall, we find that immigrants are as trusting as native-born U.S. citizens when they interact with native-born citizens but do not trust other immigrants. Immigrants appear to be less trustworthy overall but this finding disappears when we control for demographic variables. Women and older people are less likely to trust but no more or less trustworthy.

Methods Conditioned media (CM) were prepared by stimulating isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or assessment of their inhibitory effects on hepatitis B surface antigen expression in human hepatoma Hep3B cells. Results With the percent of maximal oxygen uptake at about 45.52% and percent of maximal heart rate at about 68.58% during a cycling exercise program in the present study, we considered \{HCE\} as an aerobic and a low to moderate exercise for the elderly. The concentrations of secreted cytokines such as interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor a and interferon alpha were higher in the MNC-CM from the \{HCE\} group than from the \{SC\} group. The inhibitory rates of MNC-CM of the \{HCE\} group against hepatitis B surface antigen expression were higher than that of the \{SC\} group. In the same stimulating concentration of \{PHA\} (10 µg/mL), the relative hepatitis B surface antigen expression in MNC-CM of the \{HCE\} group was 64.7% versus 81.5% of the \{SC\} group. The reduction in inhibitory rates in cytokine neutralization experiments suggests crucial roles of these cytokines for the inhibitory effect of HCE-PHA-MNC-CM against hepatitis B surface antigen expression. Conclusion The results reveal that the immune response of MNC, which are stimulated by \{PHA\} to suppress hepatitis B surface antigen expression, is greater in middle-aged subjects with low-speed \{HCE\} than in sedentary subjects.

Limited amount of training data and imbalanced number of activity instances result in over-fitting thus making recognition models inconsistent. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition approach that integrates the distance minimization (DM) and probability estimation (PE) approaches to improve the reliability of recognitions. \{DM\} uses distances of instances from the mean representation of each activity class for label assignment. \{DM\} is useful in avoiding decision biasing towards the activity class with majority instances; however, \{DM\} can result in over-fitting. \{PE\} on the other hand has good generalization abilities. \{PE\} measures the probability of correct assignments from the obtained distances, while it requires a large amount of data for training. We apply data oversampling to improve the representation of classes with less number of instances. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to combine the outputs of both \{DM\} and PE, since \{SVM\} performs better with imbalanced data and further improves the generalization ability of the approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five publicly available smart home datasets. The results demonstrate better performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art activity recognition approaches. "

While microbes and plants naturally produce a large amount of ET, mammals are reported to produce only a small amount of \{ET\} endogenously. Anthropogenic sources of \{ET\} include the combustion of gas, fuel, coal and biomass. \{ET\} is also widely used as an intermediate to make other chemicals and products and is also used for controlled ripening of fruits and vegetables. Although, a review of human and laboratory animal studies indicate \{ET\} to be relatively non-toxic, there is concern about the potential toxicity of \{ET\} because \{ET\} is metabolically converted to ethylene oxide (EtO). EtO has been classified to be carcinogenic to human by the inhalation route by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cancer. ET, however, has been classified as a Group 3 chemical which indicates it is not classified as a human carcinogen by IARC. Several studies have reported \{ET\} to cause adverse effects to plant species (vegetation effects) at concentrations that are not adverse to humans. Therefore, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conducted detailed health and welfare (odor and vegetation) based assessments of \{ET\} to develop both health and vegetative based toxicity factors in 2008 in accordance with \{TCEQ\} guidelines. The health assessment based on well-conducted animal toxicity studies resulted in identification of higher points of departures and subsequently higher effect screening levels (ESLs) that were more than a magnitude higher than the threshold adverse effect level for vegetative effects for ET. Further, based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic mode-of-actions for \{ET\} it appears the metabolic conversion of \{ET\} to EtO is of insufficient magnitude to cause concern of potential cancer risk. Therefore, the short-term \{ESL\} for air permit reviews and air monitoring evaluations is the vegetation-based \{ESL\} of 1200 ppb as it is more than a magnitude lower than the health-based acute \{ESL\} of 150,000 ppb. Similar to the acute derivation, the chronic evaluation resulted in the derivation of a chronic vegetation based \{ESL\} of 30 ppb that was much lower than the chronic \{ESL\} of 1600 ppb. In summary, the TCEQ’s acute and chronic \{ESLs\} for vegetation will protect the general public from short-term and long-term adverse health and welfare effects. The general public includes children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health conditions. "

We argue that by understanding the relationship between values and technologies in this domain, designers will be in a better position to account for values explicitly, and hence address ethical implications, throughout design. To foster such an understanding, we survey literature on pervasive computing for elderly care, and identify values, technologies and contexts discussed there. We develop a taxonomy to categorize our findings, which serves as a basis to identify and analyze relationships between values, technologies and contexts in pervasive computing for elderly care. With this analysis, we aim to help designers consider the ethical implications of their designs. "

We investigated the short-term association between air pollution and mortality and assessed the impact of improved air quality on mortality in a rapidly aging city, Seoul, Korea. The generalized additive model (GAM) was used to estimate the relative risks (RR) of mortality associated with changes in air pollution. The time trends, seasonal variations, day of the week effects, and weather effects were controlled in the models. To estimate the health benefits, we used the \{US\} Environmental Protection Agency's BenMAP. For people 0–64 years of age, elderly people (65+ years), and all age groups, an increase of 10 µg/m3 in \{PM10\} was associated with increases in daily death counts of 0.27% (95% CI: 0.04–0.50), 0.45% (95% CI: 0.27–0.64), and 0.37% (95% CI: 0.23–0.52), respectively. For ages 0–64 years, elderly people, and all age groups, a 10 ppb increase in 1-hour maximum ozone concentration resulted in an increased risk of daily death counts of 0.28% (95% CI: - 0.19–0.74), 0.96% (95% CI: 0.46–1.47), and 0.81% (95% CI: 0.35–1.26), respectively. For elderly people, it was estimated that the health benefits of attaining the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality guidelines (AQGs) for \{PM10\} (24-hour average 50 µg/m3) would suggest an annual reduction of 964 (95% CI: 564–1366) premature deaths, and 329 (95% CI: 159–500) premature deaths could be prevented annually in 2015 from attaining the WHO's guidelines for ozone (8-hour average 100 µg/m3). The rapid increase of the elderly population has major consequences and implications for society and public health. This study showed that elderly people are at higher risk for the acute mortality effects of air pollution. Therefore, cleaner air will substantially contribute to improved public health in Seoul, given the growing concern about the adverse effects of air pollution for elderly people. "

Could the purported categorical perception arise because the original social-media question was an alternative-forced-choice? In a free-response survey (N = 1401), we found that most people, including those naïve to the image, reported white/gold or blue/black, but some said blue/brown. Reports of white/gold over blue/black were higher among older people and women. On re-test, some subjects reported a switch in perception, showing the image can be multistable. In a language-independent measure of perception, we asked subjects to identify the dress’ colors from a complete color gamut. The results showed three peaks corresponding to the main descriptive categories, providing additional evidence that the brain resolves the image into one of three stable percepts. We hypothesize that these reflect different internal priors: some people favor a cool illuminant (blue sky), discount shorter wavelengths, and perceive white/gold; others favor a warm illuminant (incandescent light), discount longer wavelengths, and see blue/black. The remaining subjects may assume a neutral illuminant, and see blue/brown. We show that by introducing overt cues to the illumination, we can flip the dress color. "

Aging leads to a decline and deterioration of functional properties at the cellular, tissue and organ level. This loss of functional properties yields to a loss of homeostasis and decreased adaptability to internal and external stress. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, weight loss, and low activity that is associated with adverse health outcomes. Frailty manifests as an age-related, biological vulnerability to stressors and decreased physiological reserves. Ambient air pollution exposure affects human health, and elderly people appear to be particularly susceptible to its adverse effects. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of air pollution in the modulation of several biological mechanisms involved in aging. Evidence is presented on how air pollution can modify the bidirectional association between successful and pathological aging throughout the frailty conditions. "

Methods The \{ROS\} generation was studied in healthy subjects in age ranging from 20 to 80 years old divided in five age groups: (20–39), (40–49), (50–59), (60–69) and (70–80) years old. \{ROS\} production was quantified in a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay and the results were expressed as relative light units/min). Results \{ROS\} production in human neutrophil was activated by IFN-? in all the groups studied. This activation was down-regulated by IL-10. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 on 20–49 years old group was reversed by the pre-treatment with \{H89\} (PKA inhibitor) but not with \{PD169316\} (p38 \{MAPK\} inhibitor). This differential effect of IL-10 associated with age was not observed with the neutrophil pre-treatment with Akt/PKB or NADPH-oxidase inhibitor (DPI). Lack of IL-10 effect on \{ROS\} production was observed in older subjects (50–80 years old). The effect of IL-10 showed a significant inhibition of \{ROS\} production similar to those got with \{PD169316\} alone as compared to that of p38 MAPK. Conclusion The results suggest that inhibitory effect of the \{ROS\} production mediated by IL-10 depends on \{PKA\} for the younger and the lack effect on the elderly is p38 \{MAPK\} dependent. "

Similarly, 74.9% of subjects with total cholesterol values above the reference value indicated in the European guidelines on cardiovascular disease said they had not been diagnosed with dyslipidemia, as did 75.5% of those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values above the European reference value. The proportion of participants who were not aware that they might be suffering from those disorders was significantly higher among those who reported not having visited their doctor within the last 6 months.

Under this profile, the free radicals produced by the oxidative stress lead to the damage of DNA, lipids, and proteins with subsequent altered cellular homeostasis and integrity, in particular in cells of the immune system. Supplementation with vitamin E can protect against the deteriorating effects of oxidative stress, progression of degenerative diseases, altered inflammatory/immune response, and aging. Such a protective role has been well documented in immune cells from old animals describing how the vitamin E works both at cytoplasmaic and nuclear levels with an influence on many genes related to the inflammatory/immune response. All these findings have supported a lot of clinical trials in old humans and in inflammatory age-related diseases, which, however, have given contradictory and inconsistent results and even indicated a dangerous role of vitamin E in being able to affect mortality. Various factors can contribute to all the discrepancies, especially the doses and the various isoforms of vitamin E family (a, ß, ?, d) tocopherols and the corresponding tocotrienols used in different trials. However, the more plausible gap is the poor consideration of the vitamin E–gene interactions that may open new roadmaps for a correct and personalized vitamin E supplementation in aging and age-related diseases with satisfactory results in order to reach healthy aging and longevity. This peculiar nutrigenomic and/or nutrigenetic aspect is herein reported and discussed in the light of specific polymorphisms affecting vitamin E bioactivity. "

In spite of widespread influenza vaccination programs leading to demonstrated cost-savings in the over 65 population, hospitalization and death rates for acute respiratory illnesses continue to rise. As a person ages, increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines are commonly recorded (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6). Termed “inflammaging”, this has been linked to persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and immune senescence, while increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-ß) are possibly associated with more healthy aging. Paradoxically, a shift with aging toward an anti-inflammatory (IL-10) response and decline in the IFN-?:IL-10 ratio in influenza-challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with a decline in the cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells responsible for clearing influenza virus from infected lung tissue. Thus, it is seemingly counter intuitive that the immune phenotype of healthy aging predicts a poor cell-mediated immune response and more serious outcomes of influenza. Herein we postulate a mechanistic link between the accumulation of late-stage, potentially terminally differentiated T cells, many or most of which result from \{CMV\} infection, and the immunopathogenesis of influenza infection, mediated by granzyme B in older adults. Further, adjuvanted influenza vaccines that stimulate inflammatory cytokines and suppress the IL-10 response to influenza challenge, would be expected to enhance protection in the 65+ population. "

However, there is a lack of concomitantly longitudinal recordings at personal level of environmental temperature (PET) and cardiophysiological variables together with skin temperatures (STs, the “interface-variable” between the body core and ambient temperature). To investigate the intra-individual temporal relationships between PET, \{STs\} and \{BP\} 60 healthy young women (52 completed the entire study) were prospectively studied in a winter/summer design for 26 h under real life conditions. The main hypothesis was tested whether distal \{ST\} (Tdist) mediates the effect of PET-changes on mean arterial \{BP\} (MAP). Diurnal profiles of cardiophysiological variables (including BP), \{STs\} and \{PET\} were ambulatory recorded. Daytime variations between 0930 and 2030 h were analyzed in detail by intra-individual longitudinal path analysis. Additionally, time segments before, during and after outdoor exposure were separately analyzed. In both seasons short-term variations in \{PET\} were positively associated with short-term changes in Tdist (not proximal ST, Tprox) and negatively with those in MAP. However, long-term seasonal differences in daytime mean levels were observed in \{STs\} but not in \{BP\} leading to non-significant inter-individual correlation between \{STs\} and BP. Additionally, higher individual body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with lower daytime mean levels of Tprox and higher \{MAP\} suggesting Tprox as potential mediator variable for the association of \{BMI\} with MAP. In healthy young women the thermoregulatory and BP-regulatory systems are closely linked with respect to short-term, but not long-term changes in PET. One hypothetical explanation could serve recent findings that thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is activated in a cool environment, which could be responsible for the counter-regulation of cold induced increase of \{BP\} in winter leading to no seasonal differences in MAP. Our findings suggest that the assessment of diurnal patterns of \{STs\} and PET, in addition to the conventional ambulatory \{BP\} monitoring, might improve individual cardiovascular risk prediction.

In particular, the effects on cardiac failure and asthma were significant with the percentage change of hospital admissions per 1 °C increment of \{DTR\} at 3.0% (95% CI, 1.4–4.6) and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.1–2.0), respectively, among 9 diseases. For those 75 years and older, the \{DTR\} effect on asthma admissions was greater than in those aged under 75 years. These results support the hypothesis of a positive association between \{DTR\} and cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admission. "

abstract = "Abstract Multi-pollutant air pollution (i.e., several pollutants reaching very high concentrations simultaneously) frequently occurs in many regions across China. Air quality index (AQI) is used worldwide to inform the public about levels of air pollution and associated health risks. The current \{AQI\} approach used in China is based on the maximum value of individual pollutants, and does not consider the combined health effects of exposure to multiple pollutants. In this study, two novel alternative indices – aggregate air quality index (AAQI) and health-risk based air quality index (HAQI) – were calculated based on data collected in six megacities of China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shjiazhuang, Xi'an, and Wuhan) during 2013 to 2014. Both \{AAQI\} and \{HAQI\} take into account the combined health effects of various pollutants, and the \{HAQI\} considers the exposure (or concentration)-response relationships of pollutants. \{AAQI\} and \{HAQI\} were compared to \{AQI\} to examine the effectiveness of the current \{AQI\} in characterizing multi-pollutant air pollution in China. The \{AAQI\} and \{HAQI\} values are higher than the \{AQI\} on days when two or more pollutants simultaneously exceed the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 24-hour Grade \{II\} standards. The results of the comparison of the classification of risk categories based on the three indices indicate that the current \{AQI\} approach underestimates the severity of health risk associated with exposure to multi-pollutant air pollution. For the AQI-based risk category of ‘unhealthy’, 96% and 80% of the days would be ‘very unhealthy’ or ‘hazardous’ if based on \{AAQI\} and HAQI, respectively; and for the AQI-based risk category of ‘very unhealthy’, 67% and 75% of the days would be ‘hazardous’ if based on \{AAQI\} and HAQI, respectively. The results suggest that the general public, especially sensitive population groups such as children and the elderly, should take more stringent actions than those currently suggested based on the \{AQI\} approach during high air pollution events. Sensitivity studies were conducted to examine the assumptions used in the \{AAQI\} and \{HAQI\} approaches. Results show that \{AAQI\} is sensitive to the choice of pollutant irrelevant constant. \{HAQI\} is sensitive to the choice of both threshold values and pollutants included in total risk calculation.

Method This paper reports the results of a secondary analysis of data from a representative community survey of 6616 participants, of which 2252 had engaged in gambling activities at least once in their lifetime. Results 48.9% of older adults reported lifetime gambling. Older gamblers were more likely to be males, married or widowed (vs. never married), with pre-primary, primary and secondary education (vs. university), economically inactive (vs. employed) and had personal annual income of \{SGD\} $19,999 and below (vs. \{SGD\} $50,000 and above). Older gamblers had significantly higher rates of betting on horses, playing numbers or betting on lotteries, and playing Mahjong. After adjusting for demographic variables in multiple logistic regression analyses, gamblers aged 60 years and older had significantly lower odds of having pathological gambling than those in the younger age group (OR = 0.4). Older gamblers had significantly higher odds of having diabetes (OR = 3.2), hypertension (OR = 4.9), and any comorbid chronic physical condition assessed in this study. Conclusions For the majority of older adults, gambling remains a recreational activity that is entertaining and a way of socialization. However, one must remain cognizant of the possible risks for some to develop disordered gambling. "

Given that these systems have to manage spatiotemporal data, human intervention is required to validate automatic alarms due to the high number of false positives and the need for context interpretation. The goal of this work was to provide tools to support human action, to identify such potential risk scenarios based on spatiotemporal data visualisation. Methods and materials We propose the \{MTA\} (multiple temporal axes) model, a visual representation of temporal information of the activity of a single person at different locations. The main goal of this model is to visualize the behaviour of a person in their home, facilitating the identification of health-risk scenarios and repetitive patterns. We evaluate the model's insight capacity compared with other models using a standard evaluation protocol. We also test its practical suitability of the \{MTA\} graphical model in a commercial home monitoring system. In particular, we implemented 8VISU, a visualization tool based on MTA. Results \{MTA\} proved to be more than 90% accurate in identify non-risk scenarios, independently of the length of the record visualised. When the spatial complexity was increased (e.g. number of rooms) the model provided good accuracy form up to 5 rooms. Therefore, user preferences and user performance seem to be balanced. Moreover, it also gave high sensitivity levels (over 90%) for 5–8 rooms. Fall is the most recurrent incident for elderly people. The \{MTA\} model outperformed the other models considered in identifying fall scenarios (66% of correctness) and was the second best for burglary and fatigue scenarios (36% of correctness). Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that cyclic models are the most suitable for fatigue scenarios, the Spiral and \{MTA\} models obtaining most positive identifications. Conclusions In home monitoring systems, spatiotemporal visualization is a useful tool for identifying risk and preventing home accidents in elderly people living alone. The \{MTA\} model helps the visualisation in different stages of the temporal data analysis process. In particular, its explicit representation of space and movement is useful for identifying potential scenarios of risk, while the spiral structure can be used for the identification of recurrent patterns. The results of the experiments and the experience using the visualization tool 8VISU proof the potential of the \{MTA\} graphical model to mine temporal data and to support caregivers using home monitoring infrastructures.

As these kind of social-oriented technologies are by no way mandatory for maintaining an independent living at home, in order to ensure that they are accepted, adopted and actually used by elderly people, three complementary and intertwined issues are at stake: usability, usefulness and acceptability. In this paper, we describe how these three issues have been examined through the user-centred and mixed methodological approach that was adopted. We demonstrate that using both user tests in controlled lab environment and field trials at participants’ homes has succeeded in producing relevant insights at each stage of the design process. We discuss how these insights have either allowed confirming the choices made, and thus proceed with development efficiently, or led to design ideas to improve the application. "

Expansions of CMV-specific T cell responses have previously been demonstrated to affect the ability of T cells to respond to other infections. Most people above 60 years of age display M. tuberculosis-specific immunity because of vaccination, exposure, or both. T-cell responses can be assessed by measuring intracellular IFN-? in vitro after tuberculin stimulation. Here we investigated tuberculin-specific \{CD4\} T-cell responses in independently living healthy older people in the South of England using flow-cytometry. Individuals were investigated for tuberculin and CMV-specific T-cell immunity using in vitro antigen stimulation followed by intracellular staining for IFN-?, TNF-a, IL2, as well as degranulation and \{CD154\} upregulation. We also examined a control group of younger individuals (20–35 years of age). There was no significant difference between older and young people in regards to tuberculin responsiveness of \{CD4\} T-cells; however, older people seemed to show more outliers. Increased responsiveness to tuberculin was significantly correlated to \{CMV\} responsiveness but not age. In older donors, the memory phenotype of tuberculin-induced T-cells was significantly skewed towards a more terminal differentiation phenotype in CMV-infected compared to uninfected individuals and the degree of skewing correlated quantitatively with the size of the CMV-specific \{CD4\} T-cell response. This is a fundamental advance over previous reports of changes of the tuberculin-specific \{CD4\} T-cell response with \{CMV\} serostatus. Our results show that how the immune system responds to \{CMV\} has a fundamental impact on the phenotype and function of the immune response to mycobacterial antigens in older life. "

We investigated the transcriptome of mouse bladder mucosa at juvenile and adult stages by microarray to identify the pathways associated with normal, healthy growth and maturation. We hypothesized that understanding these pathways could be key to achieving bladder regeneration or reawakening normal function in the elderly population. Materials and Methods \{RNA\} was isolated from the mucosa at 3, 6, 20 and 30 weeks postnatally. Affymetrix® Mouse 430 v2 arrays were used to profile the expression of approximately 45,000 genes. The software program Statistical Analysis of Microarrays was used to identify genes that significantly changed during the time course. Results No genes were significantly up-regulated during maturation. However, 66 well annotated genes demonstrated a statistically significant downward trend, of which 10 of 10 were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The main functions affected by age were transcription, regulation of cellular processes, neurogenesis, blood vessel development and cell differentiation. Notable genes included collagens, Mmp2, \{SPARC\} and several transcription factors, including Crebbp, Runx1, Klf9, Mef2c, Nrp1, Pex1 and Tcf4. These molecules were indirectly regulated by inferred Tgfb1 and Egf growth factors. Analysis of gene promoter regions for overrepresented upstream transcription factor binding sites identified specificity protein 1 and epidermal growth factor receptor-specific transcription factor as potentially major transcriptional regulators driving maturation related changes. Conclusions These findings identify a coherent set of genes that appear to be down-regulated during urothelial maturation. These genes may represent an attractive target for bladder regeneration or for treating age related loss of function. "

In the United States, the nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are now more prevalent than tuberculosis. Although initially noted in men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent observations indicate increasing numbers of \{NTM\} cases in slender white women. Because of the often atypical presentation of \{NTM\} lung disease, diagnosis is commonly delayed. Because there is solid evidence that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-modifying agents are associated with serious \{NTM\} disease, it is important that specific screening tests (eg, chest x-ray, computed tomographic lung scans, sputum cultures or referral to pulmonary or infectious disease specialists) be used before initiating anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.

Infertility is particularly distressing in African societies, and is usually attributed to the woman, although male-factor infertility is increasingly being recognized. Polygamy is still relatively common in some countries as a male strategy to extend reproductive ability. Men's knowledge of, and attitudes to, family planning in some parts of Africa is still poor. The prevalence, etiology and treatment of erectile dysfunction in Africa is similar to that in other countries, but traditional (herbal) remedies are also widely used. Hereditary hemoglobinopathy is relatively common in West Africa, and priapism occurs in approximately one third of men with sickle cell disease. Parasitic infestations such as schistosomiasis and filariasis are still common in tropical Africa, and are a cause of significant male urogenital morbidity and even mortality. Sexually transmitted infections are relatively common in many African countries, and are a prominent cause of infertility, urethral stricture disease and Fournier's gangrene. In many sub-Saharan countries the average life expectancy of the population has decreased considerably due to the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ritual circumcision is a cause of morbidity and even mortality in some areas. Recently, randomized, controlled clinical trials conducted in three African countries have provided evidence that the risk of acquiring \{HIV\} infection is approximately halved by adult male circumcision. Overall, there is a clear need for health education and increased attention to the reproductive health concerns of males. Sustained efforts to improve the general level of education and to increase child survival are key factors in addressing male reproductive health issues. Moreover, proper management of age-related conditions in both males and females could have an impact on societies in Africa like nowhere else in the world, because the surviving elderly population will be the ones taking care of the HIV/AIDS orphans.

Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human–(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the “ICT biographies” of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging \{ICT\} users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy \{ICT\} users in relation to younger “generations”, for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on \{ICT\} and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing \{ICT\} practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography? "

abstract = "SummaryBackground Nurses should be well-prepared to improve and address health-related needs of older adults, but students may have difficulty understanding and empathizing, as they may not yet have personally experienced aging-related challenges. Simulation games can be used to help students understand the experiences of others, but limited information is available on the impact of simulation experiences on student empathy. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the impact of participation in an aging simulation game on nursing students' empathy and attitudes toward older adults as well as their understanding of patients' experiences in the healthcare system. Design This study used a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design. Setting A school of nursing in the Midwestern United States. Participants The convenience sample included 58 sophomore-level baccalaureate nursing students. Methods Students played the role of an older adult during a 3-hour laboratory aging simulation game, the Geriatric Medication Game® (GMG). Students completed the (1) Kiersma–Chen Empathy Scale (KCES, 15 items, 7-point Likert-type), (2) Jefferson Scale of Empathy—Health Professions Students (JSE-HPS, 20 items, 7-point Likert-type), and (3) Aging Simulation Experience Survey (13 items, 7-point Likert-type) pre- and post-game to assess study objectives. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were performed in \{SPSS\} v.21.0, as the data were normally distributed. Results Students' empathy (N = 58) toward older adults significantly improved overall (KCES p = 0.015, JSE-HPS p &lt; 0.001). Improvements also were seen on seven out of 13 questions related to attitudes and healthcare understanding (p &lt; 0.05). In the post-test, students agreed that they experienced frustration and impatience during the GMG. Conclusions Students may not be aware of older adults' feelings and experiences prior to experiencing aging-related changes themselves. Simulation activities, such as the GMG, can be a useful mechanism for addressing empathy and caring during student education. "

There are psychological differences between aggressive and nonaggressive athletes and fans. Violence is also influenced by social and situational factors, including temperature and the color of a team’s uniform. Group loyalty alters perceptions, influencing how many rule infractions are seen. Pre-game publicity stressing previous aggression and animosity between opponents may create an atmosphere conducive to violence. Fan violence can be reduced by the presence of nonviolent models and by a heterogeneous group of spectators, including the elderly, women, and children. "

The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies are evolving rapidly with innovative applications, particularly in the healthcare sector. The aim of this paper is to develop a Tele-health system, based on IoT technology, for monitoring elderly individuals suffering from Alzheimer's. This paper describes a working prototype that is able to capture the vital signs and deliver the desired data care remotely for elderly patients staying at home, using wearable \{ECG\} wireless sensor. A \{UHF\} passive wearable \{RFID\} wristband is used to monitor the whereabouts of the elderly. This prototype is successfully tested on a number of patients at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) Medical Centre in Saudi Arabia. "

This paper presents a new \{MAS\} specially designed to manage data from WSNs, which was tested in a residential home for the elderly. The proposed \{MAS\} architecture is based on virtual organizations, and incorporates social behaviors to improve the information fusion processes. The data that the system manages and analyzes correspond to the actual data of the activities of a resident. Data is collected as the information event counts detected by the sensors in a specific time interval, typically one day. We have designed a system that improves the quality of life of dependant people, especially elderly, by fusioning data obtained by multiple sensors and information of their daily activities. The high development of systems that extract and store information make essential to improve the mechanisms to deal with the avalanche of context data. In our case, the \{MAS\} approach results appropriated because each agent can represent an autonomous entity with different capabilities and offering different services but collaborating among them. Several tests have been performed to evaluate this platform and preliminary results and the conclusions are presented in this paper. "

However, the literature directly related to middle-aged and elderly patients’ attitudes toward cloud healthcare services is scant. This study develops an extended push-pull-mooring-habit (PPMH) model in order to better understand the switching intentions of middle-aged and elderly patients toward the cloud healthcare service. The results show that push effects such as low satisfaction/commitment, mooring effects such as low privacy/security, low trust, high switching costs, and habit effects along with pull effects, such as personalized care, ubiquitous care and responsiveness, all have significant effects on individual intention to switch to cloud healthcare services. Our findings will aid cloud healthcare service providers, marketers, and government health officials in understanding the intention of middle-aged and elderly patients to switch to cloud healthcare services and in developing related theories, services, and regulations.

Results Across the continuum of Hold, \{MCI\} and \{AD\} subjects, alpha sources in parietal, occipital, and temporal areas were decreased, while the magnitude of the delta and theta \{EEG\} sources in parietal, occipital, and temporal areas was increased. The fraction of serum copper unbound to ceruloplasmin positively correlated with temporal and frontal delta sources, regardless of the effects of age, gender, and education. Conclusions These results sustain the hypothesis of a toxic component of serum copper that is correlated with functional loss of AD, as revealed by \{EEG\} indexes.

Measurement of neopterin concentration is useful to monitor cell-mediated (Th1-type) immune activation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the behaviour of neopterin in long lasting asthma considering its role as a marker of the Th1 environment and to establish the distinction between patients belonging either to the allergic or the non-allergic population, particularly in the elderly where asthma is often under diagnosed. Therefore we evaluated allergic parameters such as skin prick tests, IgE and hemogram (eosinophils count), and we compared our findings with neopterin values found in an age-matched control population. A group of individuals older than 65 was selected. It included 64 asthmatic patients (mean age 72 ± 5 years) and 41 healthy individuals (mean age 79 ± 7 years). In our study population, 42 patients presented positive skin tests, mainly to house dust mites. All patients were clinically stable and presented an average percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 73.6 ± 25.3 and predicted median expiratory flow percentage (MEF50) of 38.8 ± 26.7. Blood cell counts showed statistically different mean values of eosinophils between allergic and non-allergic controls (5.42 ± 4.7% versus 2.8 ± 2.8%; p &lt; 0.04). IgE values were increased in allergic asthmatic patients when compared with non-allergic asthmatic patients (493.2 ± 549.8 IU/ml versus 85.3 ± 194.4 IU/ml; p = 0.000). Allergic asthmatic patients presented mean neopterin levels similar to those found in the control group (2.4 ± 2.8 ng/ml versus 2.1 ± 1.9 ng/ml). In contrast, in non-allergic asthmatic patients these values were higher when compared with the control group (4.0 ± 4.7 ng/ml versus 2.1 ± 1.9 ng/ml). Neopterin levels were lower in allergic asthmatic patients when compared with non-allergic asthmatic patients (2.4 ± 2.8 ng/ml versus 4.0 ± 4.7 ng/ml). Within asthmatic patients, those with higher neopterin values (&gt;2.1 ng/ml) presented lower mean IgE values (IgE = 336.58 IU) than those with lower neopterin values (=2.1 ng/ml) who presented mean IgE values of 402.70 IU. Our initial findings may lead to a better understanding of the immunoinflammatory pathways in asthma. Further studies will probably show that serum neopterin could became a useful marker for asthma classification including in elderly patients with long lasting disease. "

Thus far, there is no curative treatment for this devastating condition, thereby creating significant social and medical burdens. \{AD\} is characterized by progressive cognitive decline along with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and psychosis. Depression is a common psychiatric disorder affecting individuals across the life span. Although the “monoamine hypothesis” of depression has long been proposed, the pathologies and mechanisms for depressive disorders remain only partially understood. Pharmacotherapies targeting the monoaminergic pathways have been the mainstay in treating depression. Additional therapeutic approaches focusing other pathological mechanisms of depression are currently being explored. Interestingly, a number of proposed mechanisms for depression appear to be similar to those implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. For example, diminishing neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammation observed in depression are found to be associated with the development of AD. This article first provides a concise review of \{AD\} and depression, then discusses the putative links between the two neuropsychiatric conditions. "

We analyzed event-related oscillations in young, healthy subjects (N = 26) by using three types of stimulation: (1) a simple light signal, (2) the picture of the face of an anonymous elderly lady and (3) the picture of the subjects' own grandmother. We found a number of significant peak to peak amplitude measures in all frequency bands in the time period of 0–500 ms, allowing a differentiation between perception of the subjects' own grandmother, the unknown elderly face and the light stimulation. The results showed increased event-related oscillatory responses elicited by the unknown face compared to the known grandmother a) in the theta responses (4–8 Hz) at \{T6\} (46%), b) in the gamma (28–48 Hz) responses at Cz (22%) and \{C3\} (38%) and c) in the beta responses at \{F4\} (46%), Cz (47%) and \{P3\} (105%). In contrast, the subjects' own grandmother elicited 20% increased fast theta (6–8 Hz) oscillations at \{F4\} compared to the unknown face. Delta responses dissociated face from simple light processing, as reflected in the observation of approx. 50% higher amplitudes at the occipital compared to the frontal locations during face perception. We conclude that the described multiple brain oscillations clearly differentiate the known and unknown faces with varied degrees of selective-responsiveness in a short time window between 0 and 800 ms. Furthermore, the results are in conceptual accordance with the “selectively distributed processing” hypothesis. "

From the building industry's standpoint, design for sustainable aging implies creating the physical and service environment that is resilient and adaptable to the needs associated with the aging process. The professional community has responded with well-conceived strategies such as universal and sustainable aging design. In practice, there is an inherent challenge in traditional paper-based design communication when professionals and clients have a hard time to understand each other at the desired level. Recent technological advancement in 3D modeling applications, exemplified by the prevalence of building information modelling (BIM), has reinvigorated sustainable aging design practices. Meanwhile, serious gaming has been gaining recognition as valuable enhancement to academic learning and professional training by effectively engaging participants with meaningful and programmable visualization and interaction. This study proposed to create a unique framework that leverages the integration of \{BIM\} and game engine to streamline and contextualize design communication in sustainable aging projects. A prototype framework, Design for Sustainable Aging (DfSA), was developed and discussed in this paper. Essentially, DfSA transforms a static design model into a robust 3D gaming environment wherein design information is preserved while user-centered and experience-based interactions with model components are achieved. DfSA holds the promise to improve design communication by establishing a brand new platform for design presentation meanwhile providing an experiential instrument to elucidate the design intention. "

This study assess the sub-chronic effect of ambient air pollution on respiratory mortality in the 32 largest Chinese cities. Methods We employ two-way fixed effects panel data analysis and monthly air pollution and mortality panel data. We estimate associations between monthly respiratory mortality and air pollution; pollution is defined as particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 µm. We adjust for city characteristics, seasonality (monthly effects), and weather conditions (precipitation and temperature). We examine the associations between monthly injury mortality and air pollution to check for robustness. Results The results show positive and statistically significant associations of air pollution with respiratory mortality. During the study period (2006–2010) a 10 µg/m3 increase in monthly \{PM10\} concentration is associated with a 1.05% (95% CI, 0.08–2.04%) increase in adult respiratory mortality rate. The air pollution effect is the most salient in northern cities (with central heating system) during the cold season (October–April); a 10 µg/m3 increase in monthly \{PM10\} concentrations is associated with a 1.62% (95% CI, 0.22–3.46%) increase in the elderly respiratory mortality rate. There is no statistically significant association between the young adult respiratory mortality and air pollution. Conclusions The elderly respiratory mortality rate in China is positively and statistically significantly associated with air pollution. The effect is largest in northern cities during cold months when coal is burned for heating. "

Methods The evoked potentials and spectral power changes to simple visual stimuli of 26 healthy younger (M = 20.0 y) and 26 healthy older adults (M = 76.0 y) were examined. Results Group and individual analyses showed a clear effect of age on \{P1\} morphology and amplitude. Older adults showed significantly lower \{P1\} amplitude and 44% of older adults showed a double peaked \{P1\} compared to 12% of younger adults. Double peaked \{P1\} responses were associated with an increase in spectral power in the gamma range. Conclusions The double peaked \{P1\} may be more prevalent in older adults than previously demonstrated and may represent a de-synchronisation of the cortical sources of the visual \{P1\} in healthy ageing. Increased power in post stimulus gamma in the double peak group may be indicative of compensatory neural processing. Significance Clinically the prevalence of the double peaked \{P1\} may have been underestimated, and its reflectance of demyelinating disease overestimated. Experimentally the results suggest that any investigation of visual processing in older adults must control for early changes in \{P1\} morphology. "

Behavioural Neurology, 15, 77–85]. \{DAT\} patients in an early stage of the disease chose safe alternatives as frequently as healthy elderly persons and did not show risky behaviour as has been reported for other neurological patient groups. However, a more detailed analysis disclosed important differences between \{DAT\} and healthy elderly. Compared to healthy controls, \{DAT\} patients shifted more frequently between safe and risky alternatives and showed less consistent response patterns. Frequent changes between strategies indicate that decisions were taken randomly, that no advantageous strategy was established and that no consistent response pattern was developed over time. As regards performance changes over the task, healthy participants had a stronger tendency towards safe and advantageous responses than \{DAT\} patients. While healthy controls showed learning as the task proceeded, \{DAT\} patients did not adapt their strategies. The proportion of “consistently safe responders” was significantly higher in the control group than in the \{DAT\} group. Analysis of reaction times indicated that differences in response behaviour were not due to fast and impulsive decision taking in the \{DAT\} group. \{DAT\} patients’ response pattern may be attributed to deficits in learning and in executive functions. The frequency of changes between safe and risky choices proved to be a fair predictor for the distinction between mild \{DAT\} and healthy aging. "

abstract = "Objective The pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are still poorly understood. Altered resting state oscillatory brain activity may reflect underlying neuropathological changes. The present study using magneto encephalography (MEG) was set up to study differences in the pattern of resting state oscillatory brain activity in groups of demented and non-demented \{PD\} patients and healthy, elderly controls. Methods The pattern of \{MEG\} background oscillatory activity was studied in 13 demented \{PD\} patients, 13 non-demented \{PD\} patients and 13 healthy controls. Whole head \{MEG\} recordings were obtained in the morning in an eyes closed and an eyes open, resting state condition. Relative spectral power was calculated using Fast Fourier Transformation in d, ?, a, ß and ? frequency bands. Results In the non-demented \{PD\} patients, relative ? power was diffusely increased and ß power concomitantly decreased relative to controls. ? Power was decreased in central and parietal channels. In the demented \{PD\} patients, a diffuse increase in relative d and to lesser extent ? power and a decrease in relative a, ß and to lesser extent ? power were found in comparison to the non-demented \{PD\} group. In addition, reactivity to eye opening was much reduced in the demented \{PD\} group. Conclusions Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a slowing of resting state brain activity involving ?, ß and ? frequency bands. Dementia in \{PD\} is associated with a further slowing of resting state brain activity, additionally involving d and a bands, as well as a reduction in reactivity to eye-opening. Significance The differential patterns of slowing of resting state brain activity in demented and non-demented \{PD\} patients suggests that, in conjunction with a progression of the pathological changes already present in non-demented patients, additional mechanisms are involved in the development of dementia in PD.

It targets new innovative applications in which robotic systems will become part of these networks of artifacts to provide novel capabilities and various assistive services anywhere and anytime, such as healthcare and monitoring services for elderly in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments. Situation recognition, in general, and activity recognition, in particular, provide an added value on the contextual information that can help the ubiquitous networked robot to autonomously provide the best service that meet the needs of the elderly. Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence and its derivatives are an efficient tool to handle uncertainty and incompleteness in smart homes and ubiquitous computing environments. However, their combination rules yield counter-intuitive results in high conflicting activities. In this paper, we propose a new approach to support conflict resolution in activity recognition in \{AAL\} environments. This approach is based on a new mapping for conflict evidential fusion to increase the efficiency and accuracy of activity recognition. It gives intuitive interpretation for combining multiple sources in all conflicting situations. The proposed approach, evaluated on a real world smart home dataset, achieves 78% of accuracy in activity recognition. The obtained results outperform those obtained with the existing combination rules. "

This study provides a list of 16 differentially abundant transcripts species in the healthy old probands. Thus, these changes of abundance can be considered as easily accessible biomarkers of ageing. Some of these differential abundances like CD28, CD69, \{LCK\} (decreased abundance in old subjects), CD86, Cathepsin D, H and S (increased abundance in old subjects) might explain biochemical and cytochemical changes observed at the protein level in the immune system and thus might correspond to regulatory processes affecting the ageing process. Indeed these changes reflect the low-grade pro-inflammatory status observed in old persons and suggest a hypo-responsiveness of T-cells together with an increase in antigen presentation potential. In addition, among the differentially abundant transcripts were transcripts involved in the oxidative stress response \{HMOX1\} and \{HSPA6\} mRNAs were found as more abundant in \{PBMC\} from elderly subjects.

Subjects were examined by the Preventive Medicine and Nutrition Clinic of the University of Crete. Depression was assessed through the use of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in adipose tissue. CES-D correlated with dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that \{BDI\} was negatively associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), while CES-D was positively associated with \{DGLA\} in adipose tissue. Serum adiponectin was not significantly associated with depression. The negative relationship between adipose \{EPA\} and depression in adolescents, is in line with findings of previous studies involving adult and elderly subjects, demonstrating negative relations between depression and adipose omega-3 PUFA. This is the first literature report of a relationship between depression and an individual omega-3 fatty acid in adolescents. The inverse relationship between adipose \{EPA\} and depression indicates that a low long-term dietary intake of \{EPA\} is associated with an increased risk for depression in adolescents. "

Smart homes, where ambient and biomedical sensors can coexist, have become a suitable approach to address the main goals of home care scenarios: preventive care, recognizing deteriorating health and allowing a personalized care. To achieve these goals, applications have to exhibit adaptability and availability among other characteristics. Adaptability allows tracking the patient's state as well as reacting to abnormal situations. Availability ensures the execution of the application under failure of processing devices. In order to meet these requirements, this paper proposes a general-purpose middleware architecture based on multi-agent technology that provides mechanisms to: develop customizable applications based on the separation of concerns principle; manage the execution of applications; support adaptability by means of event-based relationships among applications; ensure availability through the use of replicated agents. The performance of the proposed middleware is assessed in terms of reaction time to adapt to irregular situations for different availability levels (number of replicated agents) and number of application services.

This is a highly aggressive tumor with strong propensity to metastasize. Surgery and radiation therapy remain the mainstay of treatment, with no curative treatment in case of disseminated metastases. Until 2008, \{MCC\} was thought to be caused by the malignant transformation of resident Merkel cells, but no investigation of a predominant molecular pathway that could be involved in \{MCC\} pathogenesis was successful. A real revolution in \{MCC\} understanding and management occurred in 2008, when a new human polyomavirus (MCPyV) was found to be the main etiological agent of this skin cancer. Following the discovery of MCPyV, the association of \{MCPyV\} with \{MCC\} has been confirmed worldwide, with detection of \{MCPyV\} in about 80% of MCCs. At the same time it had been shown that \{MCPyV\} infection is almost ubiquitous in healthy subjects, and \{MCPyV\} is thought to be persistent resident of the skin microbiome although the route of transmission, the host cell, the viral cycle and/or latency remain unknown. Most studies suggest that there may be two subtypes of MCC: MCPyV-positive (80%) and MCPyV-negative (20%) MCCs, and various studies have reported a better prognosis associated with \{MCPyV\} infection. The discovery of \{MCPyV\} in \{MCC\} patients opens up new therapeutic insights. The necessity and persistence of expression of \{MCPyV\} oncoproteins during \{MCC\} development make these proteins promising therapeutic targets. "

However, the consequences of this severe air pollution are largely unknown. This study investigates the acute effect of the smog episodes and PM2.5 on mortality for both urban and rural areas in northern China. Data and methods We collected PM2.5, mortality, and meteorological data for 5 urban city districts and 2 rural counties in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province of China from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. We employed the generalized additive models to estimate the associations between smog episodes or PM2.5 and daily mortality for each district/county. Results Without any meteorological control, the smog episodes are positively and statistically significantly associated with mortality in 5 out of 7 districts/counties. However, the findings are sensitive to the meteorological factors. After controlling for temperature, humidity, dew point and wind, the statistical significance disappears in all urban districts. In contrast, the smog episodes are consistently and statistically significantly associated with higher total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular/respiratory diseases in the two rural counties. In Ji County, a smog episode is associated with 6.94% (95% Confidence Interval, -0.20 to 14.58) increase in overall mortality, and in Ci County it is associated with a 19.26% (95% CI, 6.66–33.34) increase in overall mortality. The smog episodes kill people primarily through its impact on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. On average, a smog episode is associated with 11.66% (95% CI, 3.12–20.90) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Ji County, and it is associated with a 22.23% (95% CI, 8.11–38.20) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Ci County. A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with 0.88% (95% CI, 0.3–1.46) increase in overall mortality and 1.2% (95% CI, 0.55–1.85) in Ji County. A 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with 0.55% (95% CI, -0.02 to 1.13) increase in overall mortality in Ci County. The findings suggest that the smog episodes and fine particulate have bigger and more detrimental impacts on rural residents, especially for those living close to big and polluted cities. Conclusions The smog episodes and PM2.5 are statistically associated with mortality in rural areas of China. The associations for urban areas are not statistically significant. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground Climate change is likely to increase the threat of wildfires, and little is known about how wildfires affect health in exposed communities. A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future. Method We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research. Results We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. \{EPA\} regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity. Conclusion Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies. "

abstract = "Abstract The number of scientific investigations on women's football specific to the topics of player characteristics and demands of the game has considerably increased in recent years due to the increased popularity of the women's game worldwide, although they are not yet as numerous as in the case of men's football. To date, only two scientific publications have attempted to review the main findings of studies published in this area. However, one of them was published about 20 years ago, when women's football was still in its infancy and there were only a few studies to report on. The other review was more recent. Nonetheless, its main focus was on the game and training demands of senior elite female players. Thus, information on female footballers of lower competitive levels and younger age groups was not included. Consequently, an updated review is needed in this area. The present article therefore aims to provide an overview of a series of studies that have been published so far on the specific characteristics of female football players and the demands of match-play. Mean values reported in the literature for age (12–27 years), body height (155–174 cm), body mass (48–72 kg), percent body fat (13%–29%), maximal oxygen uptake (45.1–55.5 mL/kg/min), Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1 (780–1379 m), maximum heart rate (189–202 bpm), 30 m sprint times (4.34–4.96 s), and counter-movement jump or vertical jump (28–50 cm) vary mostly according to the players' competitive level and positional role. There are also some special considerations that coaches and other practitioners should be aware of when working with female athletes such as the menstrual cycle, potential pregnancy and lactation, common injury risks (particularly knee and head injuries) and health concerns (e.g., female athlete triad, iron deficiency, and anemia) that may affect players' football performance, health or return to play. Reported mean values for total distance covered (4–13 km), distance covered at high-speed (0.2–1.7 km), average/peak heart rate (74%–87%/94%–99% HRmax), average/peak oxygen uptake (52%–77%/96%–98% VO2max), and blood lactate (2.2–7.3 mmol/L) during women's football match-play vary according to the players' competitive level and positional role. Methodological differences may account for the discrepancy of the reported values as well. Finally, this review also aims to identify literature gaps that require further scientific research in women's football and to derive a few practical recommendations. The information presented in this report provides an objective point of reference about player characteristics and game demands at various levels of women's football, which can help coaches and sport scientists to design more effective training programs and science-based strategies for the further improvement of players' football performance, health, game standards, and positive image of this sport.

Methods Disability utility by care level (support and levels I–V) of long-term care insurance was determined by a survey of 236 professionals with four standard utility measures: EuroQol-5D, time trade-off, standard gamble, and visual analogue scale. \{DALE\} at age 65 (DALE65) and age-adjusted weighted disability prevalence (WDP) of 47 prefectures were calculated using the determined utilities, prevalence of long-term care, and life tables. The relationships of \{DALE\} and \{WDP\} to mortality from major causes and socioeconomic indicators were examined by correlation analysis. Results The determined utilities were: support, 0.78; level I, 0.68; level II, 0.64; level III, 0.44; level IV, 0.34; and level V, 0.21. The prefectural \{DALE65\} ranged from 17.11 to 15.29 years for men and from 20.21 to 18.42 years for women. Strong correlations were found between \{DALE65\} and mortality for both sexes. Male \{DALE65\} was correlated with no socioeconomic indicators, while female \{DALE65\} was correlated with some indicators. \{WDP\} was positively associated with indicators representing socioeconomic disadvantage, such as unemployment rate and percentage of elderly single households. Conclusions The socioeconomic correlates of \{DALE\} and \{WDP\} suggested that favorable socioeconomic policies, in addition to a decrease in mortality from major causes, will contribute to significant extension of the independence period in the elderly. The method proposed here encourages the practical use of health expectancy in health policy, especially at local and regional levels. "

abstract = "Background The 2006 World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines recommend using particulate matter having a diameter of under 2.5 micra (PM2.5) rather than \{PM10\} as an indicator of air particle concentration, a pattern followed by new European directives. Nevertheless, few studies have analysed this new indicator's impact at a European level on daily mortality among a high-risk group, such as persons aged over 75 years. Objective This study sought to analyse and quantify the effect of PM2.5 on daily cause-specific mortality among the over-75 age group in the city of Madrid. Methods Using Poisson regression with Generalized Additive Models (GAM), a longitudinal, ecological time-series study examined the following causes of death: all causes except accidents (International Classification of Diseases-9th revision (ICD 9): 1-799); circulatory causes (ICD 9: 390-459); and respiratory causes (ICD 9: 460-519). These were adjusted for other chemical, biotic and acoustic pollutants. Further control variables considered were: trend; seasonality; influenza epidemics; and autocorrelation between mortality series. Results A significant statistical association was detected between daily mean PM2.5 particle concentrations and all-cause mortality in the city of Madrid. This association was not in evidence for \{PM10\} concentrations. The Relative Risks found for an increase of 25 µg/m3 in PM2.5 concentrations were as follows: all-cause mortality, 1.057 (1.025–1.088); circulatory-cause mortality, 1.088 (1.041–1.135); and respiratory-cause mortality, 1.122 (1.056–1.189). The Attributable Risks were 5.41%, 8.12% and 10.90% respectively. This effect was observed in the short term (lags 1–2). Conclusion Our results indicate a strong impact of PM2.5 concentrations on daily mortality among the over-75 age group in Madrid, and underscore the need for measures aimed at lowering the concentration levels of this primary air pollutant in large cities, particularly by reducing motor vehicle traffic, the main source of such pollutant emission in urban atmospheres.

The study involved 54 healthy subjects distributed in two age groups, young (20–25 years) and elderly (65–85 years). Lipid peroxidation was induced by \{OH\} and O2- oxygen free radicals produced by ?-radiolysis of water. \{LDL\} oxidation was followed by the measurement of conjugated diene (CD), lipid peroxide (LP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. \{PON1\} was purified separately from young (Y-PON1) and elderly subjects (E-PON1). \{PON1\} activity and structure was followed by measurement of \{PON1\} paraoxonase (p.ase) activity, titration of the \{SH\} groups, and electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE. Our results show a significant decrease in the \{HDL\} antioxidant activity: percentage of protection against \{CD\} formation = 27.70% (p &lt; 0.01) for E-HDL versus 73.08% (p &lt; 0.001) for Y-HDL. Moreover, E-PON1 showed a lower antioxidant activity when compared to Y-PON1 47.08% versus 78.14%, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). Exposition of \{PON1\} to \{OH\} and O2- oxygen free radicals induced a significant decrease in \{PON1\} p.ase activity as well as a reduction in the number of PON1's free sulfhydryl groups. Moreover, our results show a close association between PON1's free sulfhydryl groups and its capacity to protect \{LDL\} against lipid peroxidation. There was a significant decrease in the number of free sulfhydryls between Y-PON1 and E-PON1 with respect to cysteine-284 amino acid residues (p &lt; 0.0092). "

abstract = "Community participation in the control of tropical diseases is of major importance nowadays, particularly for sleeping sickness (Gambian trypanosomiasis). Indeed, the authoritarian measures used with success to control this disease during the colonial period are difficult to apply now. Moreover, in the Congo, cultural and financial restrictions are such that patients sometimes refuse treatment. Thus, it has become highly desirable for vector control to be carried out at the same time as the treatment of patients. Trapping tsetse flies (or Glossina) is an ingenious and effective anti-vectorial method which has been tested in 55 villages of the Congo. The blue-black pyramid trap used does not require insecticide impregnation, and is hung in the branches by means of a capture-bag containing diesel oil. These trials, conducted in the sleeping sickness focus of the Niari river, have demonstrated the feasibility of local communities taking over the responsibility for the traps, while at the same time revealing certain obstacles. Indeed, the efficacy of this method depends on the optimization of trapping. This involves the determination of strategic capture sites by periodically harvesting the flies and moving the traps in order to catch the maximum number of flies. It also involves regular maintenance of the traps (i.e. repairs, checking the capture bag, clearing vegetation…). However, although these activities would appear to be feasible at community level, they are not always carried out satisfactorily. This results in the insufficient viability of the traps and finally to the reinvasion of the treated area by the tsetse. This study presents aspects of the present-day Congolese socio-cultural environment characterized by the revitalization of traditional Bantou mysticism and religious worship. The possessors of the ‘Vital Force’ or Kundu (sorcerers and healers) are confronted at night in an ‘over-reality’ consisting of the visible reality together with innumerable beings and objects existing specifically in the invisible state. This nocturnal confrontation may modify the local balance of power and relationships, and is also thought to cause certain symptoms of sleeping sickness and other diseases. During the colonial period, Kundu was prohibited. Under the influence of the Christian church, and because of the progress of modern medicine, the power of the sorcerers and healers gradually decreased. Then, in the 1960s, the eruption of Marxism as an anti-religious theory, modified the balance of power once more. For the population, these successive changes have lead to an ambivalent attitude of resignation towards the veracity and recognized achievements of Kundu, and the search for protection in the churches and prayer meetings. It is significant that by opposing each other, Kundu and Christianity are mutually reinforced. Kundu adapts to modern life and continues to assert its authority in the collective subconscious like a force which is essential for sacred activities. Simultaneously, the lack of drugs, equipment and personnel in health centres have led to an influx of villages to the healers. Today, the revitalization of worship is given impulse by the younger generation whereas the power of the elders tends to decline. The Congolese government is currently concerned about the proliferation of religious sects, 77 of which have been officially recorded. The trapping technique is often extremely ritualized among African people. The ‘capture force’ of a trap is considered in a complex manner as being both in the visible and invisible world. This study attempts to interpret the villager's behavior encountered over the 2 years during which the communities were responsible for the traps. In some cases the tsetse trapping is considered as involving witchcraft. It is thus not seen as achieving therapeutic ends but as being harmful, destructive, and used for persecuting and informing on the population. Destruction of the traps by youths might be also due to refusal of their request for payment. In other cases, the villagers lose interest in trapping simply because the flies decrease in number. In the Congo, where Animism, Christianity and Marxism are closely intermingled, knowledge of the current attitude towards trypanosomiasis is essential for all those engaged in control projects. A community participation approach requires a dialogue between the project teams and the rural populations. To ensure that this dialogue results in self-development, it must be based on an effective local social structure. Such an approach suggest that the project teams must recognize that considerable emphasis is being placed on the supernatural by the local population. Projects involving innovations succeed when they are accepted, that is, adapted to local beliefs and mentalities. The villagers usually accept or reject—partially or totally—an innovation according to the risk they believe to incur with regard to their material resources. To limit this risk, they attempt to break up the innovation. In the case of diseases and trapping, the risk is perceived in its mystical dimension, like an exposure to a supernatural danger. The attempt to limit the risk results in incomplete participation, and eventually in less effective trapping. The sequence of self-development is first the technical adaptation of the innovation, then the psychosocial adaptation (local beliefs and mentalities), adoption, mastership, and finally the extensive application in the natural environment. To help in the understanding of these beliefs and mentalities, we are proposing psychosociological surveys. Support structures for long-term community action will thus be determined according to the region, the ethnic group and village. Tropical disease control teams have too often been completely ignorant of the original perceptions of the participants. Good results will only be achieved if the participants perceive endemic control as being both the source of welfare and a sacred cause. "

However, understanding suicidal behaviour remains a challenging task particularly among the elders who have been poorly studied. Decision making has been recently found to be altered in suicide attempters under 65.To test wether decision making would be a neuropsychological trait of vulnerability to suicidal behaviours, the authors used the Iowa Gambling Task to investigate normothymic non demented elders with a history of suicidal behaviour (N = 35) and compared it to decision making in non suicide attempters with a past history of depression (N = 52) and comparison subjects (N = 43). The data also were compared to those of similar groups of younger normothymic subjects. Moreover, the old suicidal patients were assessed according to the age at the onset of suicidal behaviour (before or after 60).Old suicide attempters did not significantly differ from the other aged groups and according to the age of first suicidal behaviour. Old suicide attempters presented better performances than that of younger suicidal patients.Vulnerability to suicidal behaviour in older people may proceed from cognitive processes which are different from the ones involved in suicidal vulnerability of younger subjects. These results are preliminary and further studies are needed to explore vulnerability cognitive patterns to suicide among elders. "

We examine the impacts of these programs (Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS)) on health care utilization among older people in two provinces of China – Zhejiang and Gansu. The data comes from the pilot survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) collected in 2008, which contains 2685 individuals in 1570 households. We use a two-part model to analyze outpatient care. The first part is a binary equation modeling the probability of any use of outpatient service; For the second part, we use a zero-truncated Poisson model and a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and a log link to explain the number of outpatient visits and the level of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments conditional on at least one visit to a service provider, respectively. For the inpatient care, the logistic regression is employed to predict the probability of being hospitalized. All analyses are weighted and marginal effects are reported. We find that compared with people without health insurance, people with \{UEBMI\} and \{URBMI\} are more likely to use outpatient services and people with \{UEBMI\} have less \{OOP\} payments in Zhejiang while in Gansu province, people with \{NCMS\} are less likely to have outpatient visits, while people with \{UEBMI\} are more likely to be hospitalized. In addition, among those who have at least one outpatient visit, different insurance types do not make much difference in terms of the number of outpatient visits in both provinces. Our study indicates that although the health insurance programs have some positive impacts on the health care utilization, these impacts are still limited. "

Over the past 10–20 years, an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported from pediatric diabetes centers in North America and elsewhere in the world. Lifestyle factors responsible for the worldwide epidemic of overweight and obesity are responsible for the increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adults and children. This article briefly discusses the diagnosis and major types of diabetes in children but focuses on aspects of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, including demographics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, screening, prevention and treatment. The identification of children at risk for type 2 diabetes and the implementation of community-wide preventive programs will be essential to reverse the tide. The availability of calorie dense “fast foods,” candy, and sugared soft drinks must be restricted in schools and other venues frequented by children. Parents must limit the amount of time their children spend watching television and playing computer games. After-school programs that promote physical activity should be a priority of local and central governmental agencies. Prevention will only succeed if governments and local communities recognize that childhood obesity is an important public health problem and provide an environment that promotes changes in lifestyle that prevent and reverse obesity.

Of recent, it is believed that the chemical composition and physical properties of \{PM\} may contribute significantly to these adverse health effects. As part of a Belgian Science Policy project (“Health effects of particulate matter in relation to physical–chemical characteristics and meteorology”), the chemical composition (elemental and ionic compositions) and physical properties (PM mass concentrations) of \{PM\} were investigated, indoors and outdoors of old age homes in Antwerp. The case reported here specifically relates to high versus normal/low pollution event periods. \{PM\} mass concentrations for \{PM1\} and PM2.5 fractions were determined gravimetrically after collection via impaction. These same samples were hence analysed by \{EDXRF\} spectrometry and \{IC\} for their elemental and ionic compositions, respectively. During high pollution event days, \{PM\} mass concentrations inside the old age home reached 53 µg m- 3 and 32 µg m- 3 whilst outside concentrations were 101 µg m- 3 and 46 µg m- 3 for PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. The sum of nss-sulphate, nitrate and ammonium, dominate the composition of PM, and contribute the most towards an increase in the \{PM\} during the episode days constituting 64% of ambient PM2.5 (52 µg m- 3) compared to 39% on non-episode days (10 µg m- 3). Other \{PM\} components, such as mineral dust, sea salt or heavy metals were found to be considerably higher during \{PM\} episodes but relatively less important. Amongst heavy metals Zn and Pb were found at the highest concentrations in both PM2.5 and PM1. Acid–base ionic balance equations were calculated and point to acidic aerosols during event days and acidic to alkaline aerosols during non-event days. No significant sources of indoor pollutants could be identified inside the old-age home as high correlations were found between outdoor and indoor PM, confirming mainly the outdoor origin of indoor air.

However, there have been no studies in Tibet of the relation between ambient temperature and mortality. Methods We examined mean temperature and daily mortality in three Tibetan counties (Chengguan, Jiangzi and Naidong) using a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) based on 5,610 deaths that occurred in 2008–2012. We separately investigated hot and cold effects on non-accidental deaths, cardiovascular deaths, out-of-hospital deaths and vulnerability factors including age, sex and education. Results In all three counties, the effect of heat tended to be immediate, while the impact of cold lasted longer. The effects were consistent but modest in size and not statistically significant except for cumulative cold effects in Jiangzi (lag = 0–14, \{RR\} = 2.251, 95% \{CI\} = 1.054–4.849). Those who were more vulnerable to temperature extremes tended to be men, the elderly (over 65 years) and illiterate persons. We found stronger temperature effects on cardiovascular deaths than on all-cause mortality, and we also observed an increase in out-of-hospital mortality in one county. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate the temperature–mortality relationship in Tibet, and the findings may guide public health programs and other interventions to protect the population against extreme temperatures in a developing Tibet.

abstract = "Abstract There is an increasing interest about upper body accelerations during locomotion and how they are altered by physical impairments. Recent studies have demonstrated that cognitive impairments affect gait stability in the elderly (i.e., their capacity for smoothing upper body accelerations during walking) but little attention has been paid to young adults with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of this study was to examine upright stability in young adults with intellectual disabilities during walking, running, and dual-task running (playing soccer). To this aim a wearable trunk-mounted device that permits on-field assessment was used to quantify trunk acceleration of 18 male teenagers with intellectual disabilities (IDG) and 7 mental-age-matched healthy children (HCG) who participated in the same soccer program. We did not find any significant difference during walking in terms of speed, whereas speed differences were found during running (p = .001). Upper body accelerations were altered in a pathology-specific manner during the dual task: the performance of subjects with autistic disorders was compromised while running and controlling the ball with the feet. Differences in upright locomotor patterns between \{IDG\} and \{HCG\} emerged during more demanding motor tasks in terms of a loss in the capacity of smoothing accelerations at the trunk level. "

Th1-type cytokine interferon-? (IFN-?) induces neopterin production as well as tryptophan degradation via indoleamine (2,3)-dioxygenase (IDO), and quantification of these biochemical alterations allows one to monitor immune system activation. Homocysteine is known to be elevated in the elderly, which is possibly due to an insufficient availability of folate, B6, and/or B12. Design and Methods: Serum concentrations of neopterin, homocysteine, tryptophan and kynurenine, and of vitamins folate and \{B12\} were measured in 43 healthy individuals (21 females, 22 males) aged 34–93 years. The ratio of the concentration of the product of IDO, kynurenine, versus the substrate tryptophan (kyn/trp) was calculated to estimate \{IDO\} activity. Results: Comparing three age groups of similar size (34–60, 61–71, and 72–93 years), neopterin and homocysteine concentrations as well as the kyn/trp ratio were found to increase with older age (all P &lt; 0.01). Folate concentrations were lower in the middle-aged group as compared with the other two subgroups of individuals. Vitamin \{B12\} concentrations did not differ between groups. Positive correlations were found between kyn/trp and neopterin and homocysteine concentrations (all P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Increasing neopterin concentrations and kyn/trp with older age are in line with the view that aging in healthy people is associated with immune activation especially of the T-cell/macrophage system.

Much of this wintertime excess is caused by exposure to weather factors, in particular, low ambient temperatures.

A large fraction of cold-related health impacts can be avoided by taking appropriate adaptation measures such as warmer housing. Intervention measures designed to minimize cold exposure and reduce fuel poverty will likely play a key role in determining current and future health burdens of cold weather. "

Purpose To conduct a tribally-led assessment to identify the characteristics of casino patrons at Lake of the Torches Resort Casino in Lac du Flambeau \{WI\} and their preferences for a smoke-free casino. Methods A survey was administered from April to August 2011 to a stratified random sample of 957 members of the casino players club to assess their preferences for a smoke-free casino. These members were categorized into three groups: those who reported being likely to (1) visit more; (2) visit less; or (3) visit the same if the casino prohibited smoking. They were characterized by age, education, sex, race/ethnicity, annual income, players club level, and reasons for visiting the casino. Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data in October to December 2011. Weighted logistic regression was calculated to control for potential confounding of patron characteristics. Results Of the 957 surveyed patrons, 520 (54%) patrons were likely to visit more; 173 (18%) patrons to visit less; and 264 (28%) patrons were indifferent to the smoke-free status. Patrons more likely to prefer a smoke-free casino tended to be white, elderly, middle class and above, and visit the casino restaurants. Patrons within the lower tiers of the players club, almost half of the players club members, also showed a higher preference for a smoke-free casino. Conclusions This tribal casino would likely realize increased patronage associated with smoke-free status while also contributing to improved health for casino workers and patrons. "

We rewrite the balance sheet of such a pension fund as an aggregate of embedded generational options. This implies that a pension fund is a zero-sum game in value terms, so any policy change inevitably leads to value transfers between generations. We explore intergenerational value transfers that may arise from a plan redesign or from changes in funding policy and risk sharing rules. We develop a stochastic framework which accounts for time-varying investment opportunities and computes the embedded generational options. Changes in the values of the generational options enable us to evaluate the impact of policy modifications in the pension contract with respect to intergenerational transfers and redistribution. We find that a switch to a less risky asset mix is beneficial to elderly members at the expense of younger members who lose value. A reallocation of risk bearing from a plan with flexible contributions and fixed benefits to a plan with fixed contributions and flexible benefits leads to value redistribution from older plan members to younger ones.

Mutandabota is widely consumed in rural southern Africa, making it an ideal food matrix to carry probiotics. First, a process to produce probiotic mutandabota was designed. Raw cow milk was boiled and subsequently cooled to ambient temperature (25°C). Next, dry pulp from the fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) was added to the milk at a concentration of 4% (wt/vol). This mixture was inoculated with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba and left to ferment for 24 h, while the growth of the bacterial culture was monitored. Final ingredients were then added to produce probiotic mutandabota that had 14% (wt/vol) baobab fruit pulp and 7% (wt/vol) sugar in cow milk. The pH of probiotic mutandabota was pH 3.5, which ensures that the product is microbiologically safe. The viable plate count of L. rhamnosus yoba increased from 5.8 ± 0.3 log cfu/mL at the point of inoculation to 8.8 ± 0.4 log cfu/mL at the moment of consumption, thereby meeting the criterion to have a viable count of the probiotic bacterium in excess of 6 log cfu/mL of a product. Baobab fruit pulp at 4% promoted growth of L. rhamnosus yoba with a maximal specific growth rate (µmax) of 0.6 ± 0.2/h at 30°C. The developed technology, though specific for this particular product, has potential to be applied for the delivery of probiotics through a variety of indigenous foods in different regions of the world. Upon consumption, probiotic mutandabota is expected to improve the population's intestinal health, which is especially relevant for vulnerable target groups such as children and elderly people. "

Methods We investigated \{VMR\} and coherence of resting state \{EEG\} rhythms in nine normal elderly (Nold) and in 10 amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. Resting state eyes-closed \{EEG\} data were recorded at baseline pre-CO2 (ambient air, 2 min), during 7% CO2/air mixture inhalation (hypercapnia, 90 s) and post-CO2 (ambient air, 2 min) conditions. Simultaneous frontal bilateral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was performed to assess \{VMR\} by cortical oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin concentration changes. \{EEG\} coherence across all electrodes was computed at delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha 1 (8–10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5–13 Hz), beta 1 (13–20 Hz), beta 2 (20–30 Hz) and gamma (30–40 Hz) bands. Results In Nold subjects, ‘total coherence’ of \{EEG\} across all frequency bands and electrode pairs decreased during hypercapnia, with full recovery during post-CO2. Total coherence resulted lower in pre-CO2 and post-CO2 and presented poor reactivity during \{CO2\} inhalation in \{MCI\} patients compared with Nold subjects. Hypercapnia increased oxy-haemoglobin and decreased deoxy-haemoglobin concentrations in both groups. Furthermore, the extent of changes in these variables during \{CO2\} challenge was correlated with the \{EEG\} coherence, as a reflection of neurovascular coupling. Conclusions Hypercapnia induced normal frontal \{VMR\} that was detected by \{NIRS\} in both Nold and amnesic \{MCI\} groups, while it produced a reactivity of global functional coupling of resting state \{EEG\} rhythms only in the Nold group. Significance In amnesic \{MCI\} patients, global \{EEG\} functional coupling is basically low in amplitude and does not react to hypercapnia. "

Specifically, a hierarchical model with spatially varying coefficients is used to account for differences in vulnerability among census block groups.

Daily minimum temperatures and composite heat indices (e.g. discomfort index) provide a better model fit than other ambient temperature measurements (e.g. maximum temperature, relative humidity). Positive interactions between elderly populations and heat exposure were found suggesting these populations are more responsive to increases in heat. "

Data used in this research were obtained from a nationally representative household survey, Viet Nam Living Standard Survey 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The findings revealed that there were problems in health care financing in Viet Nam – many households encountered catastrophic health expenditure and/or were pushed into poverty due to health care payments. The issues were pervasive over time. Catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment problems were more common among the households who had more elderly people and those located in rural areas. Importantly, the financial protection aspect of the national health insurance schemes was still modest. Given these findings, more attention is needed on developing methods of financial protection in Viet Nam. "

Aim of the study was to assess whether these instruments identify different subsets of subjects with alcohol problems. Of the 649 participants, 19.1% were at-risk drinkers (average intake &gt;40 g/day in men and &gt;20 g/day in women). Both the screening instruments were positive in only a minority of participants. Of the 377 drinkers, 53 gave ?1 affirmative response to the \{CAGE\} questionnaire, whereas 24 had a positive MCV-?GT test. The concordance between positive \{CAGE\} questionnaire and MCV-?GT test was limited to seven subjects (kappa = 0.10), and these tests identified subjects who differed for several health and psychosocial characteristics. Participants aged ?75 years drank less, but had similar prevalence of \{CAGE\} and MCV-?GT positive markers as compared to younger participants. In conclusion, excessive drinking is common in the elderly. Screening tests based on behavioral and biological markers identify two different sets of subjects with possible alcohol problems. This might indicate the opportunity to use these instruments in conjunction. "

We, therefore, characterised CD31+ and CD31- CD45RA+ CD4+ T cells in young and healthy elderly persons. The production of IL-2 and IFN-? by the different subpopulations was studied following stimulation with \{PMA\} and Ionomycin. The expression of CD28, CD11a, CD62L, \{CXCR3\} and \{CCR7\} was also analysed. The results of this study demonstrate a pronounced increase in the percentage of CD31- CD45RA+ T cells within the \{CD4\} subpopulation of elderly persons. Both, CD31- and CD31+ CD45RA+ cells expressed CD28, CD62L, were \{CD11a\} (dim) and produced IL-2 but no IFN-?. This phenotype confirms that they were nai&amp;#x0308;ve T cells. IL-2 production by nai&amp;#x0308;ve T cells was not impaired in elderly persons. Interestingly, CD31+ as well as CD31- nai&amp;#x0308;ve T cells contained a subpopulation of CXCR3+ cells in elderly individuals, but not in young ones. In spite of expressing this chemokine receptor that enables the cells to migrate into inflammatory tissues, they were still CCR7+ and CD62L+. We speculate that due to previous contact with local environmental factors, this subset of nai&amp;#x0308;ve T cells acquires a different chemokine receptor phenotype, resulting in an altered migratory capacity in old age. Aberrant contact with antigen and effector cell differentiation in unorthodox locations may be the consequence. This could also affect Th1/Th2 polarisation, which is known to be impaired in elderly persons. "

Most striking, a different pattern of association between cytokines and Hsp was noticed in healthy elderly subjects compared to the other groups of participants.

New method We developed a procedure of synchronizing an electronic walkway (GAITRite, \{CIR\} Systems Inc.) with a multi-channel, wireless EEG-system (BrainAmp, Brainproducts). To assess the practicability of our procedure we performed a proof of concept measurement involving concurrently recording gait pattern and brain electrical activity in two elderly and two young participants. This measurement enabled us to assess the synchronization of the two data sets under realistic conditions. Results Only carrying a filled water glass reduced gait regularity in the elderly. In the young gait regularity was constant across all tasks. This concurs with previous findings reporting a task specific influence on gait. Carrying a full water glass also led to an increase in the power of the \{EEG\} gamma-band oscillations in frontal cortex of the elderly, but led to a decrease in the young participants. Carrying a full glass increased activity in frontal cortex of the elderly but decreased it in the young participants. Comparison with existing methods At present, concurrent recording of gait pattern and electrical brain activity requires participants to walk on a treadmill. Our procedure enables these measurements to be made under natural walking conditions. This allows measurements of brain activity during walking in special needs groups such as children, the elderly or the infirm under near natural conditions. Conclusions Our procedure for synchronizing \{EEG\} and gait proved simple, reliable and generated data of high-quality. "

It has been suggested that women are able to sustain this rapid pace by co-opting family members to help raise their children. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of kin will increase the reproductive rates of women using a longitudinal database collected from rural Gambia. We found that both the husband's mother and, to a lesser extent, the husband's father increased the probability that a woman would give birth. A woman's parents, however, had no effect on her fertility rate, nor did her elder sisters or co-wives. The presence of a woman's elder brothers even decreased her probability of giving birth. There was no evidence that elder children acted as “helpers at the nest,” as the existence of living elder children slowed down rather than increased birth rates. We suggest that the increased fertility in the presence of mothers-in-law may be due to these women helping out their daughters-in-law with domestic and subsistence duties. Given that it is paternal, rather than maternal, relatives who increase fertility, social pressures on women from older kin to bear many children may also be important. "

Language and speech abnormalities are also present in bipolar disorder, especially in verbal fluency and verbal memory. However, there is a lack of studies in the literature investigating different levels of linguistic processing (phonological, syntactical, and semantic) in a single cohort of euthymic bipolar patients. Based on previous findings of pervasive language impairment in euthymic elderly bipolar patients, the aim of this study was to comprise a more thorough investigation on the subject. Methods We studied 19 euthymic bipolar patients aged 60 and above, and 20 cognitively healthy subjects using the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia (ABCD) and the Test for Reception of Grammar Version 2 (TROG-2) in order to assess the phonological, syntactic, and semantic domains of language. Results Bipolar patients performed poorer than controls in Linguistic Expression (p=0.011), in Linguistic Comprehension (Following Commands; p=0.025 and Reading Comprehension of Sentences; p=0.007), and in the TROG-2 (p=0.006). Limitations The small sample comprising only elderly patients; the lack of statistical power to analyze the potential effect of individual medications on the cognitive performance. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that linguistic impairment is present in euthymic bipolar patients, affecting mostly syntactic and lexical–semantic abilities, both in comprehension and production of language. These deficits are interrelated with other cognitive skills also known to be affected in bipolar disorder, such as executive functions and episodic memory. "

Methods A review of the state-of-the-art on health care services was carried out. Then, extensive research was conducted on the particular needs of the elderly in relation to home health services that, if offered to them, could improve their day life by giving them greater confidence and autonomy. To achieve this, we addressed issues associated with the gathering of clinical data and interpretation of these data, as well as possibilities of automatically triggering appropriate clinical measures. Considering this initial work we started the identification of initiatives, ongoing works and technologies that could be used for the development of the system. After that, the implementation of \{CAALYX\} was done. Findings The innovation in \{CAALYX\} system considers three main areas of contribution: (i) The Roaming Monitoring System that is used to collect information on the well-being of the elderly users; (ii) The Home Monitoring System that is aimed at helping the elders independently living at home being implemented by a device (a personal computer or a set top box) that supports the connection of sensors and video cameras that may be used for monitoring and for interaction with the elder; (iii) The Central Care Service and Monitoring System that is implemented by a Caretaker System where attention and care services are provided to elders, where actors as Caretakers, Doctors and Relatives are logically linked to elders. Innovations in each of these areas are presented here. Conclusions The ageing European society is placing an added burden on future generations, as the ‘elderly-to-working-age-people’ ratio is set to steadily increase in the future. Nowadays, quality of life and fitness allows for most older persons to have an active life well into their eighties. Furthermore, many older persons prefer to live in their own house and choose their own lifestyle. The \{CAALYX\} system can have a clear impact in increasing older persons’ autonomy, by ensuring that they do not need to leave their preferred environment in order to be properly monitored and taken care of.

After stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, an increase in the percentage of IFN-? and IL-4 producing CD8+ T cells was observed during aging. In addition, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was investigated in two additional groups of five donors, 18–20 and 68–70 years of age. The lytic capacity of purified CD8+ T cells, after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with influenza A virus, seemed lower in 68- to 70-year-old donors than in 18- to 20-year-old donors. Therefore we conclude that the reduced \{CTL\} activity in the elderly is not the result of a lower frequency of virus-specific T cells, but more likely the result of impaired antigen-specific proliferation or lower lytic capacity of these cells.

An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily livings (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and \{ADLs\} in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. "

Objective To investigate the air pollution–mortality relationship within weather types and seasons, and to determine which combination of atmospheric conditions may pose increased health threats in the elderly age categories. Methods The relative risk of mortality (RR) due to air pollution was examined using Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) within specific weather types. Analysis was completed by weather type and age group (all ages, =64, 65–74, 75–84, =85 years) in ten Canadian cities from 1981 to 1999. Results There was significant modification of \{RR\} by weather type and age. When examining the entire population, weather type was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) weather type, with the all-age \{RR\} of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1.055 (95% \{CI\} 1.026–1.085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). On average, \{RR\} increased by 2.6, 3.8 and 1.5% for the respective pollutants between the =64 and =85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all weather types. However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days. Conclusions We identified a significant modification of \{RR\} for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific weather types. Efforts should be targeted at minimizing pollutant exposure to the elderly and/or all age groups with respect to weather type in question. "

This is highlighted by the recent American Board of Surgery requirement for formal operative assessments. A flexible and adaptable procedure feedback process may allow attending surgeons to provide qualitative and quantitative feedback to residents while encouraging surgeons-in-training to critically reflect on their own performance. Study Design We designed and implemented a flexible feedback process in which residents initiated a postoperative feedback discussion and completed a Procedure Feedback Form (PFF) with their supervising attending surgeon. Comparisons were made between the quantitative and qualitative assessments of attending and resident surgeons. Free text statements describing strengths and weaknesses were analyzed using grounded theory with constant comparison. Results We identified 346 assessments of 48 surgery residents performing 38 different cases. There was good inter-rater reliability between resident and attending surgeons' quantitative assessment, Goodman and Kruskal gamma &gt; 0.65. Key themes identified on qualitative analysis included flow, technique, synthesis/decision, outcomes, knowledge, and communication/attitudes. Subthematic analysis demonstrated that our novel debriefing procedure was easily adaptable to a wide variety of clinical settings and grew more individualized for senior learners. Conclusions This procedure feedback process is easily adaptable to a wide variety of cases and supports resident self-reflection. The process grows in nuance and complexity with the learner and may serve as a guide for a flexible and widely applicable postoperative feedback process. "

The paper starts by giving a vision of what this city is supposed to look like and how a human is to act, navigate and function in it. A framework for extending assistive technologies is proposed that considers individuals belonging to special groups of interest and locations other than their home. Technology has already reached the state of ubiquitous and pervasive sensor devices measuring everything, from temperature to human behavior. Implanting intelligence into and connecting such devices will be of immense use in preventive healthcare, security in industrial installations, greater energy efficiency, and numerous other applications. The paper reviews enabling technologies that exist and focuses on healthcare applications that support a longer and higher quality of life at home for the elderly and the disabled. It discusses intelligent platforms involving agents, context-aware and location-based services, and classification systems that enable advanced monitoring and interpretation of patient status and optimization of the environment to improve medical assessments.

More than 76.8% of the trekkers involved in alpine accidents in Japan were older than 40 years, with some experiencing a stroke or myocardial infarction while trekking at altitude. In the present study, we surveyed social trends in trekkers by interview at a popular mountain site, Mt Tanigawa (1963 m in altitude). The total number of trekkers interviewed was 511, and more than 60% of these were older than 40 years. Of trekkers older than 60 years, 42% complained of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. In 2 volunteer groups (10 younger subjects and 10 older subjects), physical condition was assessed before and after trekking. Significant body weight loss induced by dehydration was observed more often in older subjects than in younger subjects (P &lt; .05). Balance, as measured using the Nintendo WiiFit (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan), worsened in the older group (P &lt; .05). Local police records for 2009 showed that the total number of alpine accidents was 65. Injuries provoked by stumbling, slipping, and falling accounted for 51% of these, and 82% of casualties were older than 40 years, with 35% being older than 60 years. In conclusion, many older people involved in nonchallenging middle-altitude trekking have problems with regard to overall health and balance. Alpine accidents caused by myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypoglycemia tend to be more common in this population. Alpine rescue teams should be well prepared for this, and older trekkers should be made aware of their increased risk of injury in alpine settings. "

This paper presents a fuzzy-logic based context model and a related context-aware reasoning middleware that provides a personalized, flexible and extensible reasoning framework for CARA. It provides context-aware data fusion and representation as well as inference mechanisms that support remote patient monitoring and caregiver notification.

Ageism is reflected in workplace discrimination, health-care discrimination, and discrimination in nursing homes—evidenced by lack of adequate staff, in the media, and in emergency services. It is also reflected in senior abuse. In the United States, it is estimated that 1–3 million adults aged 65 and over have been injured, exploited, or otherwise mistreated by someone on whom they depend for care, protection, and love. The International Longevity Center report identifies two categories of ageism. The first creates and perpetuates ageism: social forces that shape attitudes about aging, and the media and marketing strategies that present negative depictions of older adults and the aging process. The second is what could be termed personal and institutional ageism: the tendency to dismiss signs of pathological and treatable signs of aging and normal aging in medical practices and nursing home facilities, the devaluing of older workers, and the lack of sufficient attention to cruelty toward older adults. Resulting in low reporting and lack of attention by policymakers. "

Preventive actions should focus on specific groups of people who may be subject to higher exposures (e.g., taxi or bus drivers), on susceptible subpopulations (e.g., people genetically predisposed to illness from exposure to low levels of an agent), and on traditionally ‘sensitive subpopulations’ (e.g., young and elders).

In this paper we described a Hidden Markov Model based approach for detecting abnormalities in daily activities, a process of identifying irregularity in routine behaviours from statistical histories and an exponential smoothing technique to predict future changes in various vital signs. The outcomes of these different models are then fused using a fuzzy rule-based model for making the final guess and sending an accurate context-aware alert to the health-care service providers. We demonstrated the proposed techniques by evaluating some case studies for different patient scenarios in ambient assisted living. "

The software of Sharetouch was developed within \{XNA\} and .NET frameworks. We project the users as fish in our community pond. Sharetouch displays all the friends as fish when the users log into the system. Therefore, the number of fish equals the number of friends of the users. This design encourages users to make more friends to increase the number of fish. Waterball is a game that combines virtual images and real objects. The concept is based on the Nintendo Wii games, as players hold controllers (real objects) to play the games (virtual images). We also apply the concept of the cloud flash drive to multimedia sharing to avoid the trouble of carrying a real flash disk. This study employed the \{TAM\} measure to measure the validity of Sharetouch in this social platform. Our findings indicated that all proposed hypotheses had a positive and significant impact on the intention of older people to interact with Sharetouch.

Therefore, we performed a series of clinical experiments evaluating the influence of age and health status on IFN-? production following in vitro stimulation with influenza vaccine or endotoxin. Both healthy and frail elderly people produced significantly lower amounts of IFN-? following ex vivo stimulation with influenza vaccine or endotoxin. We conclude that ageing is accompanied by a decreased capacity to produce IFN-?. This may explain the increased incidence and case-fatality caused by viruses and intracellular pathogens in the elderly. "

Apoptosis was induced by 2-deoxy-d-ribose (dRib), an agent which induces apoptosis in quiescent \{PBMCs\} by interfering with cell redox status and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Our major finding is that an inverse correlation emerged between the age of the donors and the propensity of their \{PBMCs\} to undergo dRib-induced apoptosis. \{PBMCs\} from old people and centenarians also showed an increased resistance to dRib-induced glutathione depletion and a decreased tendency to lose MMP. The anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was similarly expressed in \{PBMCs\} from the three age groups. Moreover, the plasma level of the stable product of transglutaminase, e(?-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide, a marker of total body apoptotic rate, was decreased in centenarians compared to young and elderly people. On the whole, these findings suggest that physiological aging is characterised by a decreased tendency to undergo apoptosis, a phenomenon likely resulting from adaptation to lifelong exposure to damaging agents, such as reactive oxygen species, and may contribute to one of the major phenomena of immunosenescence, i.e. the progressive accumulation of memory/effector T cells.

Counts from a hippocampal and a temporoparietal region of interest in each hemisphere were referred to the average thalamic counts. To optimize \{SPECT\} images, we used conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction and a new iterative method of conjugate gradients (CG), which takes into account the geometrical and physical characteristics of the gamma-camera. Hippocampal perfusion in the two hemispheres was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects, regardless of which reconstruction method was used, and correlated with the \{MMSE\} score. The correlation between hippocampal perfusion and the \{SRT\} score was significantly (bootstrap procedure) higher with the \{CG\} method than with the \{FBP\} method (CG: r=0.52 and 0.54; FBP: r=0.39 and 0.47, for the right and left hemisphere, respectively). These results show hippocampal hypoperfusion in patients with mild AD, a correlation between hippocampal perfusion and the severity of cognitive impairment, and enhanced identification of these subtle perfusional changes with the use of an alternative image-reconstruction method that improves the spatial resolution of \{SPECT\} images.

Previous research indicates that translating the Mayday Safety Procedure into practice among community rugby coaches is challenging. This study investigated whether Mayday Safety Procedure translation could be enhanced by systematically planning and implementing a range of theory-informed and context-specific diffusion strategies. Design A controlled before-and-after study. Methods Coaches of senior community rugby teams in five zones in New South Wales (Australia) were invited to complete a questionnaire about their Mayday Safety Procedure knowledge and practice at the end of the 2010 and 2011 rugby seasons. During 2011, coaches in the intervention zone were exposed to a range of strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion which were planned by following Step 5 of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Coaches in the other four zones were exposed to usual strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion. Results Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework, statistically significant improvements were found among intervention zone coaches in: knowledge of most Mayday Safety Procedure key criteria; the number of coaches recognising their zone policy requiring them to train players in the Mayday Safety Procedure; frequency of provision of Mayday Safety Procedure training to players; coach perceptions of the quality of Mayday Safety Procedure training for players; and in confidence that referees could implement the Mayday Safety Procedure during a game if required. Conclusions The findings suggest that the translation of injury prevention policy into community practice can be enhanced by developing and implementing a theory-informed, context-specific diffusion plan, undertaken in partnership with key stakeholders.

However, few multicity studies have been conducted in subtropical regions in developing countries. The present study assessed the health effects of temperature on mortality in four subtropical cities of China. Methods We used “double threshold-natural cubic spline” distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to investigate the cold and hot effects on mortality at different lags in four subtropical cities. Then we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the overall cold and hot effects on mortality at different lag days. Results A U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality was found in the four cities. Cold effect was delayed and persisted for about 27 days, whereas hot effect was acute and lasted for 3 days. In Changsha, Kunming, Guangzhou and Zhuhai, a 1 °C decrease of temperature under the low threshold was associated with a lag0–27 cumulative relative risk (RR) of 1.061 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023–1.099), 1.044 (95% CI: 1.033–1.056), 1.096 (95% CI: 1.075–1.117) and 1.111 (95% CI: 1.078–1.145) for total mortality, respectively. And \{RR\} for 1 °C increase of temperature above the hot threshold at the lag0 was 1.020 (95% CI: 1.003–1.037), 1.017 (95% CI: 1.004–1.030), 1.029 (95% CI: 1.020–1.039) and 1.023 (95% CI: 1.004–1.042), respectively. The cold and hot effects were greater among the elderly in Changsha, Guangzhou and Zhuhai. Meta analysis showed that the hot effect decreased gradually with lag days, with the greatest effect at current day (RR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.015–1.031); while the cumulative cold effect increased gradually with lag days, with the highest effect at lag0–27 (RR = 1.076, 95% CI: 1.046–1.107). Conclusion Both low and high temperatures were associated with increased mortality in the four subtropical Chinese cities, and cold effect was more durable and pronounced than hot effect. "

In a dynamically efficient overlapping generation economy with earnings heterogeneity, we show that, for sufficient income inequality and enough elderly in the population, a welfare system composed of a within-cohort redistribution scheme and an unfunded social security system represents the political equilibrium of a two-dimensional majoritarian election. Social security is sustained by retirees and low-income young; while intragenerational redistribution by low-income young. Unlike unidimensional voting model, our model suggests that to assess how changes in inequality affect the welfare state, the income distribution should be decomposed by age groups. "

Twenty-nine healthy elderly people (mean age 68.6 years), received a daily dose of 360 or 720 mg \{GLA\} for 2 months, using Borage oil in gelatine capsules (Quintesal®180, manufacturer Galderma Laboratorium GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). The effects of fatty acids derived from ingested borage oil capsules on skin barrier function were assessed by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The consumption of borage oil induced a statistically significant improvement of cutaneous barrier function in the elderly people, as reflected in a mean decrease of 10.8% in the transepidermal water loss. Thirty-four percent of the people noted itch before borage oil consumption and 0% afterwards. Dry skin was claimed to be reduced from 42 to 14%, but no significant alteration of skin hydration was measured. The FA-composition of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids demonstrated an increase of \{GLA\} (+70%) and \{DHGLA\} (+18%) and a reduction of saturated and monounsaturated FA. There was no significant alteration in nervonic acid or in \{AA\} content, but an increase in the DHGLA/AA ratio (+23%).

VZV-specific, T-cell-mediated immunity (VZV-CMI) is likely to be important in preventing symptomatic reactivation. As \{CMI\} declines with age, a vaccine enhancing VZV-CMI might be effective in decreasing the incidence or severity of zoster in elderly subjects. A randomized, double blind controlled trial assessing \{CMI\} responses of elderly subjects immunized with a live attenuated, VZV-Oka vaccine was conducted. Two hundred healthy volunteers (55–75 years of age) received either a single injection of the \{VZV\} vaccine (PMC), containing 3200 (Oka 3200), 8500 (Oka 8500), or 41,650 (Oka 41650) \{PFU\} of live VZV, or a pneumococcus vaccine control group (Pneumo 23(®). The immune response to \{VZV\} was assessed by measuring the T-cell response to \{VZV\} antigens, i.e. proliferation (stimulation index, SI), precursor cell frequency (PCF), cytokine secretion, and antibody titers. Six weeks post-vaccination, VZV-specific \{SI\} (adjusted mean values) was significantly greater (P&lt;0.0001) in the 3 vaccine groups (with SI=5.6 for Oka 3200; SI=5.0 for Oka 8500, and SI=7.2 for Oka 41,650) than in the control group (SI=2.9). The increase in \{PCF\} was striking, with 72.4, 91.2 and 85.1 precursors per million cells respectively in these 3 vaccine groups, vs 26.3 in the control group. No significant IL-4 secretion was observed in any subject, whereas the presence of IFN-? secretion was found to correlate with good responder status. The increase of these \{CMI\} parameters did not depend upon the titer of virus injected. Geometric mean titers of \{VZV\} antibodies increased in all vaccine groups and remained unchanged in the control group. Nevertheless, no correlation between the antibody response and the cell-mediated response was found. Live attenuated \{VZV\} vaccine caused a significant increase in VZV-CMI in a healthy, elderly population. No relationship between vaccine dose and the intensity of the specific response was found. "

Falls are the most common cause of serious injuries and are a major health threat in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. Therefore, the detection of falls in the elderly remains a major challenge in the field of public health. Specific actions aimed at the fall detection can provide urgent care which allows, on the other hand, drastically reduce the cost of medical care, and improve primary care service. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by the combination of a wearable wireless sensor node based on an accelerometer and a static wireless non-intrusive sensory infrastructure based on heterogeneous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure called \{DIA\} (Dispositivo Inteligente de Alarma, in Spanish) is an \{AAL\} (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. This inference is reinforced for prompt attention by a specific sensorisation at portable node sensor in order to help distinguish between falls and daily activities of assisted person. The wearable node will not determine a falling situation, it will advice the reasoner layer about specific acceleration patterns that could, eventually, imply a falling. Is at the higher layer where the falling is determined from the whole context produced by mesh of fixed nodes. Experimental results have shown that the proposed system obtains high reliability and sensitivity in the detection of the fall. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground The International Agency for Research on Cancer has concluded that exposure to outdoor fine particles (PM2·5) is a risk factor for lung cancer. China is experiencing unprecedentedly high levels of PM2·5 air pollution and has the highest lung cancer burden in the world. However, until now, no study has assessed the association between ambient PM2·5 and lung cancer incidence in China. Methods Data of lung cancer incidence between 1990 and 2009 were obtained from the National Cancer Registration of China. The annual concentrations of PM2·5 at 0·1°×0·1° spatial resolution between 1990 and 2005 were estimated by combining remote sensing, global chemical transport models, and ground monitoring air pollution data. A spatial age–period cohort model was used to examine the relative risks (RR) and 95% \{CI\} for incident lung cancer associated with increments in 2-year mean PM2·5 concentrations after adjusting for age, period, birth cohort, sex, community type (rural and urban), smoking rate at the community level, as well as the spatial variation in lung cancer incidence. This study was approved by the University of Queensland's behaviour and social sciences ethical review committee (2013000739). Findings During study period, there were 368?762 cases of lung cancer, including 247?533 men and 312?678 cases living in urban areas. The mean concentration of PM2·5 was 69·4 ug/m3. Incident lung cancer was positively associated with increments in 2-year mean PM2·5, and the risk was more pronounced in women (RR 1·149, 95% \{CI\} 1·120–1·178) than in men (RR 1·055, 95% \{CI\} 1·038–1·072; psex interaction &lt;0·0001). The association was smaller in rural areas (RR 1·037, 95% \{CI\} 0·998–1·078) than in urban areas (RR 1·060, 95%CI 1·044–1·075; pinteraction=0·03) and stronger in elderly people (&gt;75 years of age; 1·111 95% \{CI\} 1·077–1·146) than young people (30–65 years of age; \{RR\} 1·074 95% \{CI\} 1·052–1·096; pinteraction=0.007). Interpretation In China, lung cancer incidence is associated with PM2·5 air pollution. Effective control measures to reduce levels of air pollution are likely to reduce the incidence of lung cancer in the Chinese population. Further studies are still needed to examine causality of the association between PM2·5 and lung cancer incidence, as this study is an observational epidemiology investigation. This study used community-level incidence and air pollution exposure, but not individual-level information on exposure and outcome. We only had air pollution data for the years 1990 and 2005, and interpolated the data to 1990–2009. These might underestimate the association between air pollution and lung cancer incidence, because random measurement error in exposure will bias the effect estimates towards the null.

The fact that IL-6 is detectable in early stage diffuse plaques encourages the speculation that the acute-phase process is crucial to the pathogenesis of AD. The epidemiological association of \{AD\} with estrogen deficiency, as well as with various disorders characterized by vascular endotheliopathy, suggest a protective role for vascular nitric oxide (NO). \{NO\} has an autocrine anti-inflammatory impact on endothelium, owing in part to antagonism of NF-?B activity; since induction of IL-6 is dependent on NF-?B, this may explain recent evidence that \{NOinhibits\} macrophage IL-6 production. It is reasonable to postulate that, analogously, cerebrovascular \{NOdecreases\} IL-6 production in the brain. Vascular \{NO\} may also have direct neuroprotective activity. Estrogen, in addition to promoting vascular \{NO\} synthesis, can block IL-6 production by a more direct mechanism in cells expressing estrogen receptors; since such receptors have been reported in brain glia and astrocytes, estrogen has the potential to limit brain IL-1 activity. Testosterone likewise can inhibit IL-6 induction in androgen-responsive cells, which may include brain glia and astrocytes. Since fish oil and ? linolenic acid (GLA) suppress IL-1 production by stimulated monocytes, they conceivably could exert this effect in the brain as well; the comparatively low prevalence of \{AD\} in elderly Japanese is intriguing in this regard. These considerations suggest that a healthy cerebrovascular endothelium, sex hormone activity, and dietary fish oil/GLA may slow or prevent \{AD\} onset by dampening acute-phase mechanisms in the brain.

A total of 25 elderly, healthy volunteers (mean 66 years), who were dysphagia-free, participated in this randomized cross-over study. On separate occasions, volunteers swallowed radiolabeled placebo formulations with 50 ml water. Dynamic images with participants in a sitting position were recorded for 10 min using a gamma camera. Scintigraphic imaging showed a delay in esophageal transit (greater than 15 s) in 28% of patients in the capsule group but in none of the tablet group (P&lt;0.05). The mean transit times of the capsules and tablets were 23.8 and 3.3 s, respectively. Esophageal transit of film-coated tablets was faster than gelatin capsules, suggesting that film-coated tablets would be the appropriate formulation for all pivotal trials with risedronate and for subsequent commercialization.

However the concept in its present guise is a fairly limited one. We argue in this paper that the predominant emphasis in education programmes on safe sex as condom use may be counter-productive for some young heterosexuals for two reasons. First, this strategy is male-focused and may not extrapolate well to young women who face special risks around pregnancy and rigid societal gender norms which govern sexual behaviour. Second, health promotion strategies aimed at young heterosexuals are based on an assumption of rational decision-making in sexual encounters and obscure the non-rational nature of arousal and desire, and the unequal power relations that exist between young men and women engaging in sex. Five hundred and twelve senior rural students participated in the study which included group discussions about sexuality and survey items which focused on the meanings of safe sex and the accessibility and use of condoms. The results showed that though most students identified condoms with safe sex, many were ambivalent about using them. Reasons given related to problems of negotiation, difficulties of access, and the risks which condoms gave no protection from, such as a sullied reputation. Perhaps, partly because of this, some students were looking to less secure methods of protection such as informal history-taking and monogamy. It is argued that successful sexual health promotion strategies must address the broad spectrum of concerns facing young men and women when they become sexually active and that consideration be given to the social context in which young people conduct their sexual lives.

This bacteria is ableto cause a multitude of infections, especially in skin and soft tissues (surgical wound infections, abscesses, etc.). The pathogenicity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains is very similar to that of non-MRSA strains. In gerontology centres in the Basque Country (Spain) half of all staphylococci isolated in 2002 were MRSA. The most frequent mechanism of transmission is through contaminated hands of medical/auxiliary staff due to inadequate hand washing between attending different residents. Hand washing is the most important and effective measure for reducing the risk of transmission and should be applied in the management of all residents. The use of gloves does no supplant this measure. Rejection of MRSA-colonised individuals by centres or social services is not justified since, in practice, the presence of this infection does not represent a risk of infection for others if adequate hygiene measures are followed. MRSA-colonised individuals (unless they belong to high-risk groups: severe ulcers, behavioural disorders or respiratory colonisation) can share a room with another resident with the same multiresistant organism (residents with dermal localisation should not be put together with residents with respiratory localisation), or with another non-colonised resident so long as that person does not have ulcers, wounds, catheters, drains or tubes. MRSA-colonised individuals can use communal areas if adequate hygiene is maintained. Clean pads should be placed in incontinent individuals before they use these areas. Colonised wounds or ulcers should be covered with a \{DRY\} dressing. MRSA-individuals do not require antibiotics. These drugs do not achieve eradication, nor do they reduce transmission, infection or mortality. However, a greater number of antibiotic resistances are selected. MRSA-infected individuals should be transferred to a nursing home, following medical criteria. If not transferred to a nursing home, high-risk MRSA-infected or colonised individuals (those with severe ulcers, behaviour disorders or respiratory colonisation), can share a room with another resident with the same infection (unless the infection is localised in the respiratory tract) or, as a last resort, with a non-colonised immunocompetent resident without wounds, catheters, drains or tubes. However, these individuals should not use communal areas and visits should be restricted. Routine testing of staff attending \{MRSA\} colonised/infected individuals is not required. Personnel involved in the transfer of these individuals should follow standard precautions. "

Current literature is reviewed and reasonable approaches are discussed. Preoxygenation should be performed with high-flow oxygen delivered through a tight fitting face mask connected with a reservoir. Ketamine may be the induction agent of choice in haemodynamically unstable patients. Sugammadex, a rocuronium antagonist, may have the potential to make rocuronium the first-line neuromuscular blocking agent in emergency induction. Experienced healthcare providers may consider pre-hospital anaesthesia induction; lesser experienced healthcare providers should refrain from endotracheal intubation, but optimise oxygenation, hasten hospital transfer and ventilate patients only in life-threatening circumstances with a bag–valve–mask device or a supraglottic airway. Senior help should be sought early. In the hospital, with an expected difficult airway fibreoptic awake intubation should be performed. With a not difficult airway, airway management according to the rescuer’s skills should be attempted. In a ‘cannot ventilate, cannot intubate’ situation, a supraglottic airway should be used and, if ventilation is still unsuccessful, a surgical airway should be achieved. Capnography should be used in every ventilated patient. Continuous clinical practice is essential to retain anaesthesia and airway management skills. "

abstract = "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis to affect synovial joints.4,5,88 Although more benign than other rheumatic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the personal cost in terms of pain and disability, the financial costs of its management, 88 and the prevalence4,5 of this disease lead to serious socioeconomic consequences.46,78,88 Although there is a strong association between \{OA\} and mechanical abnormalities, and the prevalence of \{OA\} increases with age, 54 the explanation usually proffered to patients—that \{OA\} is an inevitable consequence of ageing because of the normal wear and tear of the joint—is too simplistic. It is becoming increasingly clear that \{OA\} is much more complex than previously thought. Rather than being viewed as a single pathologic entity, \{OA\} is better regarded as subsets of joint disorders, with different causes (e.g., mechanical, hormonal, or genetic), but that share common pathologic processes that result in similar alterations in articular anatomy and function and have common clinical features.63 The principal clinical features reported by patients are joint pain, decreased function, joint instability, periarticular muscle weakness, and fatigue. The onset of these symptoms is almost invariably insidious, with episodes of pain that increase in frequency and duration until, eventually, the patient may be in constant pain. A diagnosis and categorization of the severity of \{OA\} is frequently made from radiographic evidence of attrition of the articular cartilage and changes in the underlying subchondral bone. Research in \{OA\} has focused mainly on the intra-articular changes and has revealed a great deal about the pathophysiologic processes that occur within the articular milieu. In contrast, there has been very little research interest in the changes that take place in the periarticular skeletal muscles17; however, muscles are integral to joint function and the synovial joint should be considered a functional unit of the neuromuscular skeletal system, which is composed of the articulating bones, cartilage, ligaments, capsule, the muscles that effect movement, and the nerves that control movement. Accurate, controlled movement relies on each component of these units working optimally. If any component is dysfunctional, the joint will be dysfunctional. The limited number of research studies that have been performed in this area have led to an appreciation of how muscle is affected by the condition, and to growing conjecture that muscle dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA.17,57,112,116 This article presents some of the studies that implicate motor dysfunction as a cause in the pathogenesis of \{OA\} and touches on the sensory function of muscle, which is intimately linked with motor function. It also cites the results of studies demonstrating the efficacy of rehabilitation in reversing sensorimotor dysfunction to reinforce the argument that muscle plays a vital role in OA. This article should be considered, therefore, in association with two other articles in this issue, “Proprioceptive Impairment in Knee Osteoarthritis” by Dr Leena Sharma, and “Exercise in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis” by Dr Marian Minor, which provide more inclusive reviews of these areas. The present article concentrates on knee \{OA\} because most of the work studying muscle dysfunction in \{OA\} relates to knee \{OA\} in particular, largely because the knee musculature is relatively easily investigated. The choice is easily justified, however, because the knee is the joint most frequently affected by \{OA\} and knee \{OA\} the most common cause of disability among the elderly. Knee \{OA\} is a major public health problem and warrants concern and research attention. "

In the community, \{CDIs\} requiring a visit to a general practitioner are increasingly occurring among young and relatively healthy individuals without known predisposing factors. C. difficile is also found as a commensal or pathogen in the intestinal tracts of most mammals, and various birds and reptiles. In the environment, including soil and water, C. difficile may be ubiquitous; however, this is based on limited evidence. Food products such as (processed) meat, fish and vegetables can also contain C. difficile, but studies conducted in Europe report lower prevalence rates than in North America. Absolute counts of toxigenic C. difficile in the environment and food are low, however the exact infectious dose is unknown. To date, direct transmission of C. difficile from animals, food or the environment to humans has not been proven, although similar \{PCR\} ribotypes are found. We therefore believe that the overall epidemiology of human \{CDI\} is not driven by amplification in animals or other sources. As no outbreaks of \{CDI\} have been reported among humans in the community, host factors that increase vulnerability to \{CDI\} might be of more importance than increased exposure to C. difficile. Conversely, emerging C. difficile ribotype 078 is found in high numbers in piglets, calves, and their immediate environment. Although there is no direct evidence proving transmission to humans, circumstantial evidence points towards a zoonotic potential of this type. In future emerging \{PCR\} ribotypes, zoonotic potential needs to be considered. "

However, few such studies link mortality with morbidity to provide rational bases for improving public health. This paper describes a research project that developed and validated a new modeling approach directly addressing changes in life expectancies and the prematurity of deaths associated with transient changes in air quality. We used state-space modeling and Kalman filtering of elderly Philadelphia mortality counts from 1974–88 to estimate the size of the population at highest risk of imminent death. This subpopulation appears stable over time but is sensitive to season and to environmental factors: ambient temperature, ozone, and total suspended particulate matter (TSP), as an index of airborne particles in this demonstration of methodology. This population at extreme risk averages fewer than 0.1% of the elderly. By considering successively longer lags or moving averages of TSP, we find that cumulative short-term effects on entry to the at-risk pool tend to level off and decrease as periods of exposure longer than a few days are considered. These estimated environmental effects on the elderly are consistent with previous analyses using conventional time-series methods. However, this new model suggests that such environmentally linked deaths comprise only about half of the subjects whose frailty is associated with environmental factors. The average life expectancy of persons in the at-risk pool is estimated to be 5–7 days, which may be reduced by less than one day by environmental effects. These results suggest that exposures leading up to severe acute frailty and subsequent risk of imminent death may be more important from a public health perspective than those directly associated with subsequent mortality.

As such, solutions that can effectively and affordably supplement older adults’ diminishing functional capacity, and thus facilitate maintained independence and social participation over time are urgently required. The AXO-SUIT project – funded by the European Commission under the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme - is developing assistive exoskeleton devices for older adults with impaired mobility and/or difficulties in performing activities of daily living. This paper will report on-going research which aims to identify end user needs, and thus provide inputs to specify the design requirements of the AXO-SUIT exoskeletons. The objectives of this initial questionnaire study are to identify the functional assistance requirements of potential end users of the AXO-SUIT in terms of mobility, reaching and handling, and full-body support for performing activities of daily living at home and in the wider community. The end user requirements identified will be used to formulate functional specifications for the AXO-SUIT lower-body and upper-body sub-systems, which will ensure that the AXO-SUIT prototypes will provide for the specific mobility, reaching and handling needs of end users, and also to provide useful insights into the perspectives and needs of end users in relation to assistive exoskeletons in general.

Oxidation of \{HDL\} was induced in vitro by oxygen free radicals generated by water ?-radiolysis, and followed by the decrease of endogenous vitamin E and the formation of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, as well as the alterations of apolipoproteins A-I/A-II. The resistance of \{HDL\} to oxidation, evaluated by the length of the lag phase, decreased with aging. This increased oxidizability of \{HDL\} with aging could have a dramatic impact on the development of atherosclerosis in the elderly population. "

The need for an effective dementia screening tool being culture sensitive is important. Minimum data set (MDS) is a population instrument for health care management in the world, which also covers dementia screening. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the MDS-based dementia screening tools among older Chinese men in the Veteran Home in Taiwan. Overall, 576 participants (mean age: 80.9 ± 5.3 years, all males, 92.7% physically independent), 18.6% had cognitive impairment according to the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (mean score: 26.7 ± 3.9). However, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 5.5% by \{MDS\} cognitive performance scale (CPS) and 18.9% by \{MDS\} cognition scale (MDS-COGS). The screening results of \{CPS\} and MDS-COGS were highly interrelated (? = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), and \{MMSE\} scores were also significantly associated with \{CPS\} and MDS-COGS status (? = -0.50, p &lt; 0.001 and ? = -0.52, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Although the prevalence of cognitive impairment by \{MMSE\} and MDS-COGS are similar, the results are significantly inconsistent (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, both MDS-COGS and \{CPS\} were significantly correlated with \{MMSE\} scores, but significant inconsistence was noted between screening results of MMSE, \{CPS\} and MDS-COGS. Further study is needed to develop MDS-based dementia screening tools for older Chinese men in Taiwan. "

Given that air pollution triggers oxidative stress and inflammation, it is plausible that high levels of air pollutants cause higher number of hospitalisations. This study aimed to assess the impact of air pollution on the emergency hospitalisation for respiratory disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study was divided in two parts: Part I specifically addressing the air pollution assessment and Part \{II\} addressing the health assessment. Accordingly, this Part \{II\} aimed to estimate the association between the concentrations of PM10, \{SO2\} and \{CO\} observed in Rio de Janeiro and the number of emergency hospitalisations at a central hospital due to respiratory diseases. The pollutant concentrations were measured at two different sites in Rio de Janeiro, but the excess relative risks were calculated based on the concentrations observed at one of the sites, where limits were generally exceeded more frequently, between September 2000 and December 2005. A time series analysis was performed using the number of hospitalisations, divided in three categories (children until 1 year old, children aged between 1 and 5 years old and elderly with 65 years old or more) as independent variable, the concentrations of pollutants as dependent variables and temperature, relative humidity, long term trend, and seasonality as confounders. Data were analysed using generalised additive models with smoothing for some of the dependent variables. Results showed an excess risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disease higher than 2% per 10 µg m- 3 increase in \{PM10\} concentrations for children under 5 years old, of 2% per 10 µg m- 3 increase in \{SO2\} for elderly above 65 years old and around 0.1% per 10 µg m- 3 increase in \{CO\} for children under 1 year and elderly. Other studies have found associations that are in agreement with the results achieved in this study. The study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants experienced in Rio de Janeiro between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the number of hospitalisations for respiratory diseases among children and elderly.

These two bodies of knowledge provide the theoretical vantage point for our empirical analysis of the “missing link” between trainee and partner – the manager. Based on an ethnographic study of a Big 4 Firm (pseudonym Sky Accounting), we suggest understanding the career step of the manager as a rite of passage that has two effects: first, managers experience that their previous identity is destabilized; and second, our study shows how a set of new practices (performing, playing games and politicking) shape the identity of managers, enabling them to navigate the complex organizational network of a Big 4 Firm. We conclude our paper with a discussion of power effects of the rite of passage, how it shapes the identity of managers, and the practice of managerial work in a Big 4 Accounting Firm. "

abstract = "Antecedentes La medida de la presión arterial efectuada por un médico, y de forma general por personal sanitario, a menudo genera en el paciente la denominada reacción de alerta caracterizada por un incremento de los valores de presión arterial cuyo principal factor parece ser la interacción entre el paciente y el observador. En general, los médicos producen una reacción de alerta mayor que la desencadenada por las enfermeras o por personal ajeno a la medicina, sin que dispongamos de información referente a la influencia del sexo del médico en este fenómeno. Objetivo Analizar la influencia del sexo del médico observador en la reacción de alerta desencadenada por la toma de la presión arterial en ancianos. Metodología La población corresponde a la incluida en el estudio EPICARDIAN, estudio poblacional, transversal, sobre ancianos no institucionalizados, en un área de salud madrileña. Dicho estudio incluía dos fases: domiciliaria (fase I, n = 1.200) y hospitalaria (fase II, sobre una muestra seleccionada aleatoriamente, n = 333). Las tomas de presión arterial convencionales se efectuaron según tres patrones diferentes: en el domicilio de los sujetos, por un grupo de enfermeras entrenadas (todas mujeres) y en el hospital por dos médicos, un varón (grupo A, n = 131, 46% varones) y una mujer (grupo B, n = 152, 45% varones); todos los sujetos eran informados de que el observador era un médico. Además se efectuó un registro ambulatorio de 24 h, de presión arterial con medidas cada 15 min (Spacelabs 90207) definiéndose los períodos diurno y nocturno en función del diario de actividades entregado por el paciente. La reacción de alerta domiciliaria y hospitalaria se definen como la diferencia entre las tomas convencionales con esfigmomanómetro de mercurio en el domicilio y en el hospital, respectivamente, con la media del período diurno del registro ambulatorio. Resultados Las presiones arteriales en la consulta del hospital resultaron para todo el grupo más elevadas que las medias del período diurno del registro, en el 83% de los pacientes (15 mmHg para la presión arterial sistólica y 7 mmHg para la presión arterial diastólica, respectivamente). Las diferencias entre los valores de presión arterial en el hospital y el período diurno fueron significativamente superiores en las mujeres (17 ± 16 frente a 12 ± 16; p &lt; 0,0001) y en ambos sexos aumentaba con la edad (p = 0,001) y los valores de presión arterial tomados en el hospital (p &lt; 0,001). No se demostraron diferencias en cuanto a edad, sexo e índice de masa corporal entre los grupo A y B. No presentaron diferencias significativas en la reacción de alerta domiciliaria entre los grupos A y B, pero se evidenció una diferencia muy significativa al comparar la reacción de alerta hospitalaria de ambos grupos. El grupo A, entrevistado por un varón, presentó como media una reacción de alerta 10 mmHg superior a la experimentada por el grupo B entrevistado por una mujer (22 ± 18/11 ± 11 mmHg frente a 12 ± 16 /3,6 ± 10 mmHg reacción de alerta sistólica/diastólica, respectivamente; p &lt; 0,001 en ambos casos). El sexo del paciente no modificó la influencia del sexo del observador en la reacción de alerta. Conclusión Existe una reacción de alerta diferente cuando la toma de la presión arterial la efectúa un doctor o una doctora, que llega a ser 10 mmHg mayor para el primer caso, diferencia que resulta independiente del sexo del paciente examinado.

Prior studies have shown how people spend more time socializing through digital communication services such as \{SNSs\} reducing face-to-face interaction. Individuals limited offline interactions cause a sense of self-perception of being less socially involved. In this paper we explore how the use of an ubiquitous system we developed, Tlatoque, is able to adapt and move the SNS's social capital outside the desktop into a domestic setting to support older adults' offline interactions with their family. The findings of a 21 week deployment study uncovered the offline practices surrounding the use of Tlatoque and its social implications toward the existing family ties (n=30). Results qualitatively indicate that the content shared in \{SNSs\} strengthens older adults' social network by enriching and complementing traditional social engagements such as those conducted over the phone or in-person.

However, little is known about the short-term effect of pollution generated by gas-fired power plants on the health of elderly people. Methods During three months, daily emergency visits/hospital admissions of subjects living within 3 km from a gas-fueled power plant were counted and related to ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter of median aerometric diameter &lt; 10 µm (PM10). A generalized additive model served to correlate visits/hospital admissions to pollutants, controlling for meteorological confounders. Results Mean air concentrations of \{PM10\} and \{NO2\} were higher after-than before the start of operation of the plant, with the highest concentrations recorded within 1 km. Although pollutants were below the limits set by the European legislation, in elderly people there was a positive correlation between the number of emergency visits and daily air concentrations of \{PM10\} and NO2, as measured at 1 and 3 km from the plant. In subjects aged 70 years or more, the number of hospital admissions was positively correlated with \{PM10\} levels measured within 3 km from the power plant, whereas in older subjects (= 80 year) it was also significantly linked with the lowest air concentration of \{PM10\} (measured at 6 km from the plant). Discussion Combustion of natural gas for energy generation produces a rise in air concentration of \{PM10\} and \{NO2\} close to the plant, with a concentration-dependent increment of daily emergency visits and hospital admissions in elderly people, and with an age-dependent susceptibility.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of an activity curve, which represents an abstraction of an individual’s normal daily routine based on automatically-recognized activities. We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics.

Data accumulated so far consistently and clearly show that both basal and cytokine (IL-2 and interferon a and ?) induced antitumor MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic activity of \{NK\} cells are well-preserved in the healthy elderly. To investigate if the non-cytotoxic functions of \{NK\} cells are also spared from the influence of senescence, recombinant IL-2-inducible secretion of IFN-?, which serves as a first line of defense, was examined. The amount of IFN-? secreted by purified, 18 h activated \{NK\} cells from the elderly was only 25 percent of that released by the cells from the young. Thus, the type 1 cytokine-inducible cytotoxic and cytokine secretory functions appear to be dissociable properties of \{NK\} cells, at least in the elderly. However, this aging-related early phase secretory deficit could be overcome by chronic stimulation with IL-2 (7 day culture). Since different subsets could perform different functions, we analyzed the \{NK\} subsets by flow cytometry. A minor \{CD56bright\} subset and a major \{CD56dim\} subset could be distinguished based on the density of expression of the cell surface \{CD56\} molecule (N-CAM). We inquired if immunosenescence is likely to impact the steady-state level of circulating \{NK\} subsets. A significant decrease (P&lt;0.01) in percent \{CD56bright\} among CD56+ cells was observed in the elderly with a relative sparing of the \{CD56dim\} subset. The CD56bright/CD56dim ratio, perhaps representing \{NK\} cell maturity status, declined with age. This maturation-related subset redistribution and partial loss during aging of high affinity IL-2aß? receptor bearing `immature' \{CD56bright\} \{NK\} cells has not been reported before. It could be a consequence of the decline in the level of IL-2 during aging. It is concluded that post-adolescent age-associated modulations in human \{NK\} cells are not expressed uniformly; they are pronounced in some, subtle in others but negligible in yet other biological parameters.

Personal \{PM10\} concentrations were 192.8 ± 100.6 µg m-3 in summer and 154.6 ± 105.4 µg m-3 in winter. Modeled personal exposures were less than measured personal exposures while a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71 was obtained. Based on measured and modeled exposures, a mean personal cloud of 30.2 µg m-3 was estimated in summer and 16.5 µg m-3 in winter. Moderate correlation emerged between personal and community \{PM10\} concentrations in summer (r = 0.39), and stronger correlation was found in winter (r = 0.82). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shown that smoking, cooking and cleaning activities did not produce significant effect on personal exposures. Further more, multivariate regression analysis performed in this study revealed that community \{PM10\} level contributed most of personal \{PM10\} exposure, 32% in summer and 64% in winter, respectively. The findings of this study indicated that \{PM10\} personal exposures were considerably influenced by outdoor particulate matter rather than typical indoor sources, and ambient \{PM10\} level measured at community monitoring sites may be used as a surrogate of personal exposure to PM10.

abstract = "“It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.” Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869–1948). With the current demographic shift being experienced by populations globally, almost linear increases in life expectancy have been seen and can be expected. However, increases in healthy life expectancy may not keep pace. Among older populations the proportion of time spent in less than full health tends to increase. As a result, the accurate valuation of life spent in states less than full health will become increasingly important. Different techniques and approaches have been used to measure health in populations. The use of summary measures of population health such as \{DALYs\} (Disability Adjusted Life Years) has become common, and is widely used to compare health between populations and to evaluate the potential impact of interventions in economic analyses. Most of the commonly used summary measures of health express some measure of life lived in full health and life lived with disability or in a state of sub-optimal health. Critical to the construction of summary health measures are values assigned to health states. Current tools used in determining these values include the standard gamble, time trade off, person trade off, and the visual analogue scale. However, these techniques all have the disadvantage of incorporating individual biases (derived from particular characteristics specific to individuals or populations) into the process through which health state valuations are derived. As a consequence health states are often not directly comparable between populations, since characteristics such as nationality and ethnicity can influence how health states are valued. Furthermore, health can be judged differently by those of different ages, with the young often assigning a lower value to life lived at less than full health compared to older people. The challenge of obtaining opinions which are not influenced by an individual's own circumstances is not new. This issue was encountered and described by the American philosopher John Rawls in ‘A Theory of Justice’ (1971), in which he employed a thought experiment called ‘the veil of ignorance’ as a means of overcoming this problem. In this thought experiment an individual is asked to make decisions about distributive justice by imagining they are behind a ‘veil of ignorance’, whereby they are unaware of their own position in society. Here we discuss how current methods for deriving health state values may incorporate a veil of ignorance approach, and how this may benefit the comparability of the health state valuations produced. We also propose how such methods may be operationalised. Considering these issues, we propose that a new society with new needs and a progressively growing interest in maintaining adequate health requires appropriate measures of health. These measures should facilitate derivation of objective measures of health that are comparable to those acquired in other populations, irrespective of age, gender, disease status, ethnicity and geographical location. Promoting and improving health demands adequate measures of health and the application of the Rawlsian veil of ignorance approach could be an effective alternative. "

abstract = "Summary It has been recognized that the remarkable decline in infant mortality and the extension in human lifespan involving both developing and developed countries alike, has been influenced by social and economic developments and public health orientated measures (such as clean water and sewerage) rather more than by developments in medical research. However, the identification of important disease risk factors for a number of common conditions such as smoking, solar exposure, dietary fat and alcohol has led to further reductions in disease prevelance and mortality, at least in some countries. The varied success of strategies to reduce the mortality from circulatory, nutritional and diseases due to infection has had the predictable result of leaving communities more exposed to the chronic non-communicable diseases, especially those affecting the elderly. The \{COPCORD\} community-based studies, carried out largely in tropical Asia/Pacific countries, have indicated that the burden of musculoskeletal conditions as far as pain and disability, as well as from an economic point of view, are substantial and \{WHO\} has called for increased research and educational activities into the causes and consequences of chronic disease and in particular rheumatic diseases. To the problems of an increasing ageing population can be added the rapid growth of urban populations, new occupational stresses, lifestyle changes and a number of other factors (WHO, 1984). The common community-based rheumatic diseases are not \{RA\} or \{SLE\} that dominate admissions to hospital arthritis clinics. Pain and disability are most often caused by osteoarthritis, especially knee OA, and various soft tissue rheumatic problems producing neck, back, shoulder and elbow pain. Viral and reactive arthritis cannot be ignored and the complications from osteoporosis (although not normally considered a rheumatic condition), are a significant threat to ageing populations worldwide. It is clear that for many of these conditions, certain risk factors have been identified and that preventative strategies are becoming available although far more detailed research is still required (Wigley, 1993). Community education is an essential part of prevention and treatment and the ILAR-sponsored publication Aches and Pains—Living with Arthritis and Rheumatism (Hampton, 1992) is available in at least 10 different languages and fills an important need. Education helps to influence not only knowledge but also skills and attitudes. A modern attitude about the potential control of disease may negate the fatalism of certain societies where the individual belives that there is little that can be done to protect against either a limited lifespan or aches and pains that are simply a natural consequence of physical work, age or damp conditions. And, as has been shown in Indonesia (Darmawan et al, 1992c), less literate rural communities spared the pervasive influence of television, can show the benefit of public education if provided with imagination, skill and knowledge of local conditions.

Design A comparison of performances on neuropsychological tests between 2 samples of subjects: inpatients in an acute rehabilitation hospital without known cerebral disease and normal community-dwelling persons. Setting Acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Patients and Participants Nineteen hospitalized patients without delirium who were screened for pre-existing cerebral and psychiatric illness, dementia, and dependency in basic self-care skills before hospitalization. Eighteen community-dwelling persons who were not different in terms of age and education served as the control group. Methods Participants completed 10 commonly used neuropsychological tests of executive, language, and memory functions. Data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis of variance. Main Outcome Measurements Raw scores on the 10 neuropsychological tests. Results Hospitalized patients performed significantly worse on 9 of 10 tests than community-dwelling participants. Older hospitalized participants had significantly greater cognitive impairment than younger hospitalized participants, which suggested increased susceptibility to effects of hospitalization on cognition. Conclusions Patients hospitalized without brain injury, and especially elderly patients, should be carefully monitored for cognitive deficits that may affect posthospitalization quality of living. Further research is needed to determine whether the cognitive deficits in such patients persist after discharge and affect functional independence, and to identify mechanisms for the deficits. Furthermore, the use of hospitalized participants without brain injury as control subjects in neuropsychological studies of brain injury should be balanced with an additional comparison group of matched, neurologically healthy, normal subjects who live in the community to control for cognitive impairments that are associated with acute hospitalization.

An assay for granzyme B, one of a family of serine proteinases implicated in the ‘lethal hit’ that leads to target cell lysis, is an alternative simple measure of \{CTL\} activation. We measured granzyme B activity using its both preferred and unique substrate tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Asp-thiobenzyl ester (BAADT) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from influenza vaccinated subjects, and stimulated with live virus. We found that granzyme B activity increases in parallel and correlates with cytolytic activity as measured by 51Cr release assays in these virus-stimulated \{PBMC\} cultures. The assay was then used to measure the cell-mediated cytotoxic response to influenza vaccination in ten healthy elderly subjects. Peak granzyme B activity (day 6) was measured in lysates of \{PBMC\} stimulated with influenza virus, obtained from study participants before and after vaccination. We found a signigicant increase in granzyme B activity from pre-vaccination levels to 4 weeks post vaccination (pre = 2.77 U/mg protein, post = 7.23 U/mg protein, p = 0.002) and a subsequent decline in the activity measured at 12 weeks post vaccination (4.34 U/mg protein, p = 0.0007). Due to its substrate specificity which is unique within the family of serine proteases, this assay is highly specific for granzyme B. The assay also avoids the potential hazard of radioactivity (51Cr) in the clinical laboratory and the need for a ? counter. The assay of granzyme B activity, therefore, provides a simple, specific and responsive method for measuring changes in cell-mediated cytotoxic activity resulting from influenza vaccination. "

According to recent survey results in Japan, there is a high percentage of older people who own and play electronic or computer games, but rarely do they play the games with their family members. It is a positive sign that more older people are participating in the digital games arena, but it would be even more beneficial if they could interact actively with the young family members through gaming activities. This could possibly strengthen family bonding and bridge the gap between older people and youth culture. This paper presents steps for designing an intergenerational family entertainment system which focuses on physical and social interactions using a mixed reality floor system. The main design goals include: facilitating interactions between users with varied levels of skill in utilizing technology, utilizing the familiar physical motions from other activities to make an intuitive physical interface, and encouraging social interactions among families and friends. Detailed implementation of these steps is presented in the design of our intergenerational entertainment system, Age Invaders. Four main prototype iterations for the system is presented. Our design process is based on User Centered Design and relies on constant involvement of users to understand the key issues and to help make effective design decisions. The results of the study help to focus the refinements of the existing platform from a usability standpoint and also aids in the development of new physical entertainment and interactive applications. This study provides insights into user issues including how users interact in a complex mixed reality experience, which is heavily based in physicality. The use of one portion of the user base which is most proficient with technology before involving the novice users was found to empower novice users to begin to use digital technology. "

Regarding to their complexity, in order to generate sophisticated assistance, the system needs to integrate harmonically into the domestic environment without any interference on ongoing activities of those concerned. Aims \{OPDEMIVA\} ascertains possibilities in real-time-recognizing of \{ADLs\} applying innovative contactless optical measurement sensors with focusing on the detection of high-risk behavioural patterns. Methods An interdisciplinary research team of technical and health-care experts was involved in the mutual project. Based on examination of the list of \{ADLs\} and preconceiving both aspects of medical importance and technical feasibility, a subset of relevant behavioural patterns was identified. An appropriate technical system based on optical smart sensor technology for \{ADLs\} detection was developed and preliminarily tested. Results In preliminary tests several fundamental ADLs, e.g. movement and recreation could be detected with high reliability while possible deficits like motionlessness over a defined period became derivable. Conclusions Smart sensor based detection of dementia-related high-risk behavioural patterns requires extensive detailed examination of capabilities and needs of persons concerned. Patient's privacy and ethic concerns are of high relevance. Results gained as yet imperatively demand further research. "

Despite the recent awareness of such public health problems, integrative studies investigating the effects of age on the physiological responses to heat wave thermal conditions remain scarce. Daily rhythmicity of core temperature (Tc) and locomotor activity (LA), as well as parameters representative of energy balance and IGF-1 levels which are involved in the aging process and stress resistance, were monitored in a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Adult and aged animals, acclimated to long days (LD) or short days (SD), were monitored during 8-day periods of exposure to 25 °C and 34 °C. Adult animals displayed efficient coping with heat exposure, regardless of the photoperiod. Hence, efficient responses resulted in decrease of energy intake, energy expenditure, IGF-1 levels and \{LA\} levels, promoting hyperthermia avoidance. Positive energy balance was maintained and water turnover did not change significantly after heat exposure. In contrast, while aged animals acclimated to \{LD\} responded similarly to adults, aged mouse lemurs acclimated to \{SD\} showed great difficulties coping with heat exposure. Indeed, in this group, normothermia impairment was associated with increased Tc levels, alterations in daily rhythmicity, negative energy balance and increased IGF-1 levels. Impaired responses to heat exposure were seen in aged mouse lemurs acclimated to \{SD\} only. The main effects were observed during diurnal resting periods, suggesting decreased capacities with age to dissipate excess body heat. Taken together, these data highlight daily rhythmicity and IGF-1 pathway as main targets in the impaired response to heat exposure in the elderly. "

In collaboration with NASA, \{VZV\} \{DNA\} was found in saliva of health astronauts suggesting asymptomatic virus reaction due to the stress of spaceflight. This lead to a series of studies indicating virus \{DNA\} can be found in saliva of patients with \{VZV\} associated neurologic disease. With the goal of eliminating the need for lumbar puncture to diagnose \{VZV\} associated neurologic disease; we developed a rapid saliva test for the detection of \{VZV\} \{DNA\} in saliva that can be used in space as well as on Earth.

Driven by the increasing awareness of the health aspects of air pollution exposure, especially by most sensitive sub–populations such as children and the elderly, short–term air pollution forecasts are being provided more and more by local authorities. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used by governmental agencies to characterize the quality of the air at a given location. \{AQI\} is used for local and regional air quality management in many metropolitan cities of the world. The main objective of the present study is to forecast short–term daily \{AQI\} through previous day’s \{AQI\} and meteorological variables using principal component regression (PCR) technique. This study has been made for four different seasons namely summer, monsoon, post monsoon and winter. \{AQI\} was estimated for the period of seven years from 2000–2006 at \{ITO\} (a busiest traffic intersection) for criteria pollutants such as respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) using a method of \{US\} Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), in which sub–index and breakpoint pollutant concentration depends on Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The Principal components have been computed using covariance of input data matrix. Only those components, having eigenvalues = 1, were used to predict the \{AQI\} using principal component regression technique. The performance of \{PCR\} model, used for forecasting of AQI, was better in winter than the other seasons as studied through statistical error analysis. The values of normalized mean square error (NMSE) were found as 0.0058, 0.0082, 0.0241 and 0.0418 for winter, summer, post monsoon and monsoon respectively. The other statistical parameters are also supporting the same result. "

Higher temperatures not only impact the comfort of urban dwellers, but also increase energy use, ozone production, and the risk of death for humans in a heat wave. Our research focuses on the variation in land surface temperature in the Gywnns Fall Watershed, Maryland. We found that land surface temperature is highly variable spatially, resulting in “hotspots” within the heat island. We further explore how this temperature variation relates to social factors on the scale of the census-based block group. We show that land surface temperature is statistically higher in block groups that are characterized by low income, high poverty, less education, more ethnic minorities, more elderly people and greater risk of crime. These variables were mapped to evaluate the spatial relationship of land surface temperatures to social factors. This spatially explicit approach facilitates identification of specific areas to prioritize for heat prevention and intervention efforts. We demonstrate, through an exercise, how incorporating data on land surface temperature and social factors into heat intervention strategies could contribute to efficient allocation of limited resources and services. The exercise also indicates where heat prevention efforts, such as tree-planting programs, are most needed to help reduce heat exposure and moderate the urban heat island effect. "

At present we know of &gt;300 enzymes and &gt;1000 transcription factors that require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells participate in signaling events. Zinc has been very successfully used as a therapeutic modality for the management of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry type of macular degeneration. Zinc not only modulates cell-mediated immunity but is also an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

Then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard “growth” diet — (2) “sunflower” diet (high ?6/?3 ratio) — (3) “borage” diet (high ?-linolenic acid) — (4) “fish” diet (high in long chain ?3). Mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. At 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. We demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. Therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.

abstract = "Abstract With the onset of deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere about 20,000 years ago, a rich temperate biota, earlier driven southward by ice-age cold, began its long, slow return to East Asia. Fully modern and technologically sophisticated Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens communities re-engineered their ecological niche in keeping with these changes by mapping on to newly productive hunting localities, gathering grounds, and raw-material sources and situating their wintering/home base residential sites in relation to the others. Acorns, nuts, annual seeds, and other foods accessed within such logistic networks were at first gathered wild, but over millennia came to be harvested, tended, and finally domesticated in great quantity. Agriculture, population, and infrastructural additions to natural landscapes expanded in scope. Over a long period, originally familistic lineage heads and elders claimed an ever-increasing authority and personal share of the collective wealth generated by the community. Archeological evidence and written histories, appearing earliest in Central China, document the rise of elite family dynasties that garnered enormous wealth and luxury through their control of agriculture, industry, and trade, while peasant laborers profited far less. Military force applied to outsiders on their borders, and at times to their own people, became an important instrument of this ruling class. Central Riverine China led in all these developments, and over time neighboring peoples in Northeast China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East engineered their own civic and productive infrastructures according to the same dynamics, resulting in a pervasive spread of anthropogenic landscapes throughout East Asia.

They come mainly from electric utilities, especially those that burn coal and industrial facilities that derive their products from raw materials such as metallic (e.g. Power plants) ore, coal, and crude oil, or that burn coal or oil to produce process heat. Sulfur oxides and sulfate particles cause a wide variety of health and environmental impacts, particularly to sensitive groups including people with asthma, the elderly, and people with heart or lung disease. Peak levels of \{SO2\} in the air can cause temporary breathing difficulty, asthma attacks, and increased respiratory symptoms. Long-term exposures to \{SO2\} and sulfate particles cause respiratory illness, aggravate existing heart disease and premature death. Sulfur oxides react with other substances in the air to form acid rain, which accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, damages forests and crops, changes the makeup of soil, and makes lakes acidic and unsuitable for fish. \{WHO\} air quality guidelines for sulfur dioxide are 20 µg m-3 24-h mean and 500 µg m-3 10-min mean, respectively.

In addition, spontaneous and induced production of these cytokines was also measured in cultures of \{PBMCs\} of fourteen healthy young individuals as a control group of age. A significant decrease in \{CD2\} (pan T-cells) and \{CD4\} (T-helper) lymphocyte subpopulations, but unchanged \{CD8\} (T-suppressor) subset, and a reduced response in delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity tests were observed in senile underweight anorectic patients. Monocyte counts did not show significant differences between patients and control subjects. The spontaneous release by \{PBMCs\} of all the cytokines measured did not differ between the anorectic and either the elderly or young control group. A significant increase in IL-6 production after mitogen stimulation with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) after 24 and 48 h of culture, as well as a greater induced TNFa production after 48 h of incubation with the same mitogens, was found in the anorectic patients as compared with the elderly controls. However, stimulated production of both IL-1ß with \{TPA\} and of IFN? with \{PHA\} did not differ significantly between anorectics and aged controls. In vitro production of IL-6 by \{PBMCs\} was significantly higher in elderly than in young controls, while the production of the other cytokines did not change. Our findings suggest, therefore, that primary anorexia of aging is associated with a defective cell-mediated immunity together with a complex derangement of cytokine production, which might probably be linked to an age-associated loss in the normal regulation of the expression for these molecules.

This study examined the association between respiratory symptoms and outdoor wood smoke in Launceston, Tasmania, where ~ 30% of homes use wood burners for domestic heating. This ecological study examined data from participants of the 2004 Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study postal survey and compared the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in Launceston (n = 601) with that in Hobart (n = 1071), a larger Tasmanian city with much less wood smoke. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations of interest while adjusting for gender, atopy, history of allergic disease and current smoking status. There were no significant differences in symptom prevalence between Launceston and Hobart. Two subgroup analyses, which examined participants with pre-existing chronic respiratory disease, and those who reported actively using a wood burner in their home, also did not find significant differences. Any impact of wood smoke on non-specific respiratory symptoms might have been overshadowed by other important determinants of respiratory health, such as vehicle exhaust and tobacco smoking, or were too small to have been detected. However, the lack of detectable differences in symptom prevalence might also reflect the success of regulatory action by local governments to reduce wood smoke emissions in Launceston. The results of other epidemiological studies support an association between ambient wood smoke exposure and adverse respiratory health. Further investigations of wood smoke exposure in Australian settings are needed to investigate the lack of significant associations found in this study, especially studies of indoor air quality and health impacts in children and elderly populations.

This has also had the effect of increasing the number of elderly population. More than ever, health-care institutions must now care for a large number of elderly patients, which is one of the contributing factors in the rising health-care costs. Rising costs have prompted hospitals and other health-care institutions to seek various cost-cutting measures in order to remain competitive. One avenue being explored lies in the technological advancements that can make hospital working environments much more efficient. Various communication technologies, mobile computing devices, micro-embedded devices and sensors have the ability to support medical staff efficiency and improve health-care systems. In particular, one promising application of these technologies is towards deducing medical staff activities. Having this continuous knowledge about health-care staff activities can provide medical staff with crucial information of particular patients, interconnect with other supporting applications in a seamless manner (e.g. a doctor diagnosing a patient can automatically be sent the patient's lab report from the pathologist), a clear picture of the time utilisation of doctors and nurses and also enable remote virtual collaboration between activities, thus creating a strong base for establishment of an efficient collaborative environment. In this paper, we describe our activity recognition system that in conjunction with our efficiency mechanism has the potential to cut down health-care costs by making the working environments more efficient. Initially, we outline the activity recognition process that has the ability to infer user activities based on the self-organisation of surrounding objects that user may manipulate. We then use the activity recognition information to enhance virtual collaboration in order to improve overall efficiency of tasks within a hospital environment. We have analysed a number of medical staff activities to guide our simulation setup. Our results show an accurate activity recognition process for individual users with respect to their behaviour. At the same time we support remote virtual collaboration through tasks allocation process between doctors and nurses with results showing maximum efficiency within the resource constraints. "

The \{MDS\} classification systems were revised recently and updated. These refined classification and prognostic schemes help stratify patients by their risk of leukemia progression and death; this knowledge can help clinicians select appropriate therapy. Although many treatments for \{MDS\} have been proposed and evaluated, at present, only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers any real hope for cure, and no available therapy beyond general supportive care offers benefit to more than a minority of patients. However, recent clinical trials enrolling patients with \{MDS\} have reported encouraging results with use of newer drugs, including lenalidomide, decitabine, and darbepoetin alfa. Other exciting treatment regimens are being tested. Here, we present a contemporary, practical clinical approach to the diagnosis and risk-stratified treatment of MDS. We review when to suspect MDS, detail how to evaluate patients who may have a form of the condition, explain key features of treatments that are currently available in the United States, and summarize a general, common-sense therapeutic approach to patients with MDS.

The current Directive 2008/50 \{CE\} governing air quality in European cities, draws no distinction between which particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5 or PM10–2.5) would be the best indicator on days with/without Saharan dust intrusions. This study sought to identify the role played by Saharan dust in the relationship between particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5 and PM10–2.5) concentrations and daily mortality among the elderly in the city of Madrid. Methods We conducted an ecological longitudinal time-series study on daily mortality among the over-75 age group, from 2003 to 2005. Poisson regression models were constructed for days with and without Saharan dust intrusions. The following causes of daily mortality were analysed: total organic causes except accidents (International Classification of Diseases-10th revision (ICD-10): A00-R99); circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99); and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00–J99). Daily mean PM10, PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 levels were used as independent variables. Control variables were: other ambient pollutants (chemical, biotic and acoustic); trend; seasonalities; influenza epidemics; and autocorrelations between mortality series. Results While daily mean PM2.5 concentrations in Madrid displayed a significant statistical association with daily mortality for all the above causes on days without Saharan dust intrusions, this association was not in evidence for \{PM10\} or PM10–2.5 in the multivariate models. The relative risks (RRs) obtained for an increase of 10 µg/m3 in PM2.5 concentrations were: 1.023 (1.010–1.036) for total organic causes; 1.033 (1.031–1.035) for circulatory causes; and 1.032 (1.004–1.059) for respiratory causes. On Saharan dust days, a significant statistical association was detected between \{PM10\} (though not PM2.5 or PM10–2.5) and mortality for all 3 causes analysed, with \{RRs\} statistically similar to those reported for PM2.5. Conclusions The best air quality indicators for evaluating the short-term health effects of particulate matter in Madrid are therefore \{PM10\} concentrations on days with, and PM2.5 concentrations on days without Saharan dust outbreaks. This fact should be taken into account in a European Directive regulating ambient air quality in almost all countries in the Mediterranean area. "

Both the efficiency of the initial tumor target binding step i.e., recognition of K562, the NK-sensitive erythroleukemia cell line, as well as the ability of \{NK\} cells to deliver lethal hit are highly conserved during healthy aging. In fact, the elderly exhibit a statistically significant, moderately higher frequency of active killers among circulating lymphocytes. Analyzed in another way, a majority of “high \{NK\} responders” were found to be older donors, while none in the “low \{NK\} responders” group were &gt; 70 years old. Gamma interferon, a gene product as well as an autocrine activator of \{NK\} cells, is effective in converting non-lytic “pre-NK” cells to active killers at single-cell level. This in vitro cytokine sensitivity of \{NK\} cells is unaltered during immune senescence. The intactness of the \{NK\} cell's capacity to be modulated may be vital in both tumor resistance and host viral defenses of aged humans. "

To describe the incidence of falls/injuries in a walking team ball game (Lifeball) designed for seniors, a prospective cohort study was undertaken amongst community dwelling Lifeball participants in Australia. Players completed a telephone survey soon after commencing Lifeball (2004) and 12 months later (2005). Attendance and incident records were audited for the period. Subjects joined a Lifeball group with opportunity to play at least once per week. Baseline was completed by 284 players aged between 40 and 96 years (mean 67 years), with most (83.8%, 238/284) female. Of 263 followed up, the average attendances was 25, with 19.3% attending on fewer than 4 occasions and 14.3% attending 52 or more times. Most (93.9%) reported no injuries requiring medical attention. However, 16 (6.1%) had injuries requiring medical attention and their 27 injuries represent an injury rate of 3.3 per 1000 hours of participation. Twenty participants (7.6%) had a Lifeball fall equating to a fall rate of 2.8 per 1000 hours of participation. Falls in Lifeball were not associated with measured predictors (age, gender, falls history, perceived falls risk or hours played). Incident records showed a trip/stumble involving rushing, walking backwards, or overextending (all against rules) as common falling causes. Lifeball is not ‘risk free’ however due to a lack of comparative data it is difficult to compare injury rate to relevant activities. Prevention of injury should concentrate on enforcing safety rules.

Conclusions For pre-oxygenation, high-flow oxygen should be delivered with a tight-fitting face-mask provided with a reservoir. In haemodynamically unstable patients, ketamine may be the induction agent of choice. The rocuronium antagonist sugammadex may have the potential to make rocuronium a first-line neuromuscular blocking agent in emergency induction. An experienced health-care provider may consider prehospital anaesthesia induction. A moderately experienced health-care provider should optimise oxygenation, fasten hospital transfer and only try to intubate a patient in extremis. If intubation fails twice, ventilation should be resumed with an alternative supra-glottic airway or a bag-valve-mask device. A lesser experienced health-care provider should completely refrain from intubation, optimise oxygenation, fasten hospital transfer and only in extremis ventilate with an alternative supra-glottic airway or a bag-valve-mask device. With an expected difficult airway, the patient should be intubated awake. With an unexpected difficult airway, bag-valve-mask ventilation should be resumed and an alternative supra-glottic airway device inserted. Senior help should be called early. In a “can-not-ventilate, can-not-intubate” situation an alternative airway should be tried and if unsuccessful because of severe upper airway pathology, a surgical airway should be performed. Ventilation should be monitored continuously with capnography. Clinical training is important to increase airway management skills. "

Many of these deaths are attributed to delays in seeking treatment and poor adherence to drug regimes. While there are a growing number of studies describing the factors influencing treatment seeking for malaria, far less is known about the relative weight given to these factors in different settings. This study estimates two models of demand for malaria treatment in the Farafenni region of The Gambia. The first examines the determinants of seeking malaria treatment outside the home versus no treatment or self-care while the second identifies the determinants of provider choice conditional on having decided to seek malaria treatment outside the home. Providers included hospital; health centre; and ‘other’ which included pharmacies, kiosks; petty traders; neighbours; and traditional healers. Results show that older people were more likely to opt for self-care, or no treatment. The longer the time spent ill or the more severe the fever, the more likely a treatment was sought outside the home. Time of the year and availability of community infrastructure played a key role in both models. Poorer households and those from the Fula ethnic group were much more likely to visit an ‘other’ provider than a hospital. The policy and methodological implications of these findings are discussed.

Linearity of D-dimer determination was shown over the range from 0.5 to 36 µ g/ml, and recovery studies demonstrated 94 to 108 % recovery. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 0.6 to 11.3 % at plasma D-dimer levels of 0.54 to 30.1 µ g/ml. No interference by lipids, bilirubin, haemoglobin, rheumatoid factor, or ?-globulin was noted. The normal D-dimer range was &lt; 0.5 µ g/ml in healthy ambulatory subjects, while the level in elderly subjects with atherosclerosis (14 %) or in immobilized subjects (38 %) was well above this limit. There was a strong correlation between plasma and serum D-dimer levels (r=0.993). D-dimer levels measured by this \{LPIA\} showed a good correlation with those determined using two kinds of ELISA. The \{LPIA\} D-dimer levels were elevated in some subjects with diseases predisposing to DIC, but remained below 10.0 µ g/ml. On the other hand, the \{LPIA\} D-dimer levels in \{DIC\} subjects were almost always above 10.0 µ g/ml. Our study showed that a hypercoagulable state should be suspected when the \{LPIA\} D-dimer level is &gt; 0.5 µ g/ml and that \{DIC\} should be diagnosed when the level is &gt; 10.0 µ g/ml in the presence of an appropriate underlying disease. This \{LPIA\} system can rapidly evaluate the presence of a hypercoagulable state as accurately as any ELISA, and thus seems potentially valuable for both emergency and routine laboratory use. "

Twenty patients were provided with ZigBee built-in blood glucometer and mobile phones, and were instructed on using a web service where the measured blood glucose could be transmitted directly to the web and be administrated. Nine patients participated in \{ECG\} monitoring, by using a wireless, transmittable \{ECG\} recording instrument equipped with ZigBee protocol attached to their chest. Daily average transmission frequency, rate of transmission loss, and error reasons were analyzed. In addition, the patients were asked to score their degree of satisfaction about the sensors and u-healthcare services. Results The mean transmission frequencies were 2.1 times/day in blood glucose monitoring and 6.1 times/day in ECG. The patients’ satisfaction scores of the blood glucometer and service used in this research were 8.59 and 9.01 of 10 points, respectively.

In AC-depleted cultures, purified T cells from the aged respond normally to the co-mitogenic stimuli, \{PHA\} + PMA.

Objectives Specification of the relation between psychopathology, cognition and aging. Aims Cross sectional examination of the age related executive changes in a sample of adults with a history of psychiatric illness using the CANTAB. Methods A total of 406 patients (18-72 years), diagnosed with (a) affective disorders (N=153), (b) substance related disorders (N=112), (c) personality disorders (N=82), or (d) pervasive developmental disorders (N=59), completed \{CANTAB\} executive function tests of working memory (SWM), strategic planning (SOC) and set shifting (IED). Test performances were compared with those of 52 healthy adults. Results Both in the patient groups and the healthy participants, similar rates of executive decline were found. Conclusions The present research indicates that the decline of executive skills in populations with psychiatric conditions does not exceed the age related executive changes typically seen in healthy aging adults. Still, compared with the latter, patients seem to earlier reach the critical threshold at which functional deficits emerge, notwithstanding the comparable decline rates. Understanding aging and its interaction with cognition in later life may refine treatment design for the elderly patient. "

Knowledge Several epidemiological studies found a short-term association between all cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, and various air pollutants. These results were notably established in French, European and American multicentre studies as well as in meta-analysis. Furthermore, some studies have identified populations that are more vulnerable to the effects of air pollutants. Children, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases and people with lower socioeconomic status have been found to be more susceptible to air pollution. Perspectives More research on the patho-physiological mechanisms of the effects of air pollutants needs to be carried out, especially to investigate the role of nitrogen dioxide. In addition, studies on the health effects of the elemental components of particulate matter should be extended in the future. Finally, a better characterization of the most vulnerable populations as well as the causes of this susceptibility would be of great interest. Conclusion The coherence observed among the results of epidemiological studies and the knowledge provided by toxicological and experimental studies are in favour of causality of the short-term links observed between air pollution and mortality.

The authors then define routinization then present a set of researches showing that routine can be a marker of vulnerabilities in psychological, social, neuropsychological and cognitive areas. Based on this, the authors then try to show that routinized behaviours are classically observed in a variety of clinical expressions, particularly at the level of psychotic troubles (ex. schizophrenia), of pervasive developmental disorders, of anxious and mood troubles. All this allows the authors to question the outcome of these observations, more particularly their utility in the field of clinical practice, taking for example the functions of routinization in weakened elderly and autistic persons. The authors conclude in inviting clinicians to pay more interest to routinized behaviours and to begin research to best define what is due to a banal and adaptable routinization and what is due to a process leading a subject to a general impoverishment of his resources in the short or long term.

abstract = "Without medical progress, dementing diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease will become one of the main causes of disability. Preventing or delaying them has thus become a real challenge for biomedical research. Steroids offer interesting therapeutical opportunities for promoting successful aging because of their pleiotropic effects in the nervous system: they regulate main neurotransmitter systems, promote the viability of neurons, play an important role in myelination and influence cognitive processes, in particular learning and memory. Preclinical research has provided evidence that the normally aging nervous system maintains some capacity for regeneration and that age-dependent changes in the nervous system and cognitive dysfunctions can be reversed to some extent by the administration of steroids. The aging nervous system also remains sensitive to the neuroprotective effects of steroids. In contrast to the large number of studies documenting beneficial effects of steroids on the nervous system in young and aged animals, the results from hormone replacement studies in the elderly are so far not conclusive. There is also little information concerning changes of steroid levels in the aging human brain. As steroids present in nervous tissues originate from the endocrine glands (steroid hormones) and from local synthesis (neurosteroids), changes in blood levels of steroids with age do not necessarily reflect changes in their brain levels. There is indeed strong evidence that neurosteroids are also synthesized in human brain and peripheral nerves. The development of a very sensitive and precise method for the analysis of steroids by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) offers new possibilities for the study of neurosteroids. The concentrations of a range of neurosteroids have recently been measured in various brain regions of aged Alzheimer’s disease patients and aged non-demented controls by GC/MS, providing reference values. In Alzheimer’s patients, there was a general trend toward lower levels of neurosteroids in different brain regions, and neurosteroid levels were negatively correlated with two biochemical markers of Alzheimer’s disease, the phosphorylated tau protein and the ß-amyloid peptides. The metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone has also been analyzed for the first time in the aging brain from Alzheimer patients and non-demented controls. The conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to ?5-androstene-3ß,17ß-diol and to 7a-OH-dehydroepiandrosterone occurred in frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and striatum of both Alzheimer’s patients and controls. The formation of these metabolites within distinct brain regions negatively correlated with the density of ß-amyloid deposits. "

In connection with a consequent compliance of different environment measures a successful combat of the acarids is guaranteed. Escorting a scabies break-out through the public health service clarifies the anomaly and the problems in nursing homes. After individual treatments of residents and staff at the facility as well as the simultaneous treatment of all residents and staff of the residential area within eight months to a containment of the outbreak had led, was the simultaneous treatment of a wider circle of contact people, including once intensifying ambient under the coordination of the ÖGD decided. Besides a systematic registration of the aggrieved parties, there were appointments or-site, conservations with employees and meetings with their relatives taking place. A two-term therapy of all persons within a week-distance and an exact observation of all measures for the environment construction ended the break-out. After a total of 10 months the living area was free of scabies. Up to now, there have been no further incidences. Concerning the diagnosis and the therapy of the infection in an elderly facility, many professions are included (doctors, nursing stuff, dermatologist), whose various procedures and therapy approaches need to be coordinated. Targeted and timely advice and coordination established by the ÖGD enables quick termination of such an outbreak.

In this paper we use oral-history testimonies from older people to reconstruct an ‘historical ethnography’ of rural life in Albania, the most isolated and repressive of the East European socialist regimes. We build our analysis around the dialectical relationship between the ‘shortage economy’, which was all-pervasive and derived from the Albanian regime's Stalinist policy of prioritising mining and heavy industry over consumer goods and agriculture, and the ‘second economy’ which developed as a bottom-up strategy to overcome some of the imbalances and blockages in the official or ‘first’ economy. Fieldwork was carried out in clusters of villages and settlements corresponding to cooperatives and a state farm in four locations in different parts of Albania. Within the symbiotic or ‘lubricating’ relationship between the shortage economy and the second economy, we examine the ‘institutionalised hierarchy of access’ that gave some people and groups privileged access to scarce goods, whilst others remained in a marginalised and partially excluded state.

Although approaches focused on functional analysis of floor features have drawn valuable guidelines at this respect, the main problem remains unsolved. A new approach to this problem considers people's accommodation to friction conditions depending on their safety perception as a risk factor. In this sense, this paper analyses the influence of flooring design elements in safety perception in the elderly using Conjoint Analysis. Flooring and environmental parameters (texture, joints, colour, profile morphology and ambience) and its levels were used for the orthogonal fractional-factorial design to generate a representative subset of flooring scenarios. One hundred and eighty people older than 60 years took part in the experiments. They were selected in a balanced distribution of gender, age (into two age groups: 60–75 years and &gt;75 years) and living environments (residence, day centres and assisted homes). For each living environment, the elderly according to their perception of safety ranked eight virtually modified pictures from the best to the worst. Results show that safety perception for each residence group depends on the flooring and ambient features. However, there were no differences between the two age groups. Regarding design features, texture was the most influent parameter, being the presence of noticeable joints an unexpected factor to transmit safety as well. Conjoint analysis allowed determining the safest and the most unsafe combinations of design elements for each of the groups and ambiences. This information helps flooring and ambient designers to convey the right safety perception for the elderly to reduce risk of falling by eliciting the proper accommodation. Relevance to the industry This paper offers information relevant to a growing economical sector formed by interior designers, building industry and manufacturers of floorings and lighting for the elderly. Results can help them in providing products and environments better adapted to the elderly needs. "

It sometimes seems difficult for nurses to assess and intervene in game playing because games are usually described by the players with a mixture of emotions that include humor, derision, scorn, frustration, and anger. Because humor usually predominates the descriptions presented by a player, it is often easy to laugh along with the storyteller and ignore the impact that the gaming behavior has on the quality of the caregiving relationship.

Pascal Introduction Since the 1990’s, many epidemiological and toxicological studies have addressed the effect of current ambient levels of air pollution on mortality. Knowledge Several epidemiological studies found a short-term association between all cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, and various air pollutants. These results were notably established in French, European and American multicentre studies as well as in meta-analysis. Furthermore, some studies have identified populations that are more vulnerable to the effects of air pollutants. Children, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases and people with lower socioeconomic status have been found to be more susceptible to air pollution. Perspectives More research on the patho-physiological mechanisms of the effects of air pollutants needs to be carried out, especially to investigate the role of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. In addition, studies on the health effects of the elemental components of particulate matter should be extended in the future. Finally, a better characterization of the most vulnerable populations as well as the causes of this susceptibility would be of great interest. Conclusion The coherence observed among the results of epidemiological studies and the knowledge provided by toxicological and experimental studies are in favour of causality of the short-term links observed between air pollution and mortality.

Twenty-three cognitively unimpaired older adults were randomly assigned to receive memory training or standard outpatient care only.

Pre- and post-test measures included prose and list recall, WAIS-III digit symbol, strategy use measures and platelet \{PLA2\} group activity. After cognitive training, patients in the \{EG\} group had significant increase in cytosolic, calcium-dependent \{PLA2\} (cPLA2), extracellular (or secreted), calcium-dependent \{PLA2\} (sPLA2), total platelet \{PLA2\} activity, and significant decrease in platelet calcium-independent \{PLA2\} (iPLA2) activity.

abstract = "Publisher Summary Fluorine is ubiquitous in the nature and is consequently an inevitable part of the biosphere and human life. Fluorine is available to humans, plants and animals mainly in the form of fluoride ion (F). Body fluoride status depends on numerous factors, including the total amount of fluoride ingested daily, its bioavailability and metabolism. The adequate intake (AI) of fluoride ion from all sources is set at 0.05 mg/day/kg body weight; this intake is recommended for all ages above 6 months, because it confers a high level of protection against dental caries and is not associated with any known unwanted health effects. A conflict arises from two claims: the first, that fluoride stimulates new bone growth and hence is useful therapeutically in controlling osteoporosis, and the other, that it is the cause of the increasing prevalence of hip fractures in the elderly. Fluoride is currently not recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis, although slow release fluoride therapy is reportedly beneficial. The chapter focuses on the effects of fluoride on dental health, skeletal fluorosis, and use of fluoride for treating osteoporosis. Current information on the main sources of human exposure to fluoride and current recommendations for adequate intake of fluoride, as well as methods for assessing exposure, have been reviewed. "

This sets up a game between generations in which one generation's strategy may be to save too little and rely on gifts from the young (e.g. public assistance) for retirement income. Social security can therefore be viewed as a Pareto-optimal contract to restore efficient intertemporal allocation. A funded public pension plan corresponds to forced saving but is vulnerable in that the next young generation may stop contributing, rely on its children for retirement assistance and meanwhile reap the consumption externality from the current elderly's social security benefits. This suggests a forced-giving or pay-as-you-go type of compulsory pension plan (such as exists in most nations) which also has the advantage of aiding the initial old generation and therefore generating an immediate consumption externality for the initial young. The approach can also be used to explain other aspects of existing social security. "

Cognitive neuroscience researchers have identified behavioral anomalies that are significant indicators of cognitive decline. A general goal is the design of innovative methods and tools for continuously monitoring the functional abilities of the seniors at risk and reporting the behavioral anomalies to the clinicians. SmartFABER is a pervasive system targeting this objective. Methods A non-intrusive sensor network continuously acquires data about the interaction of the senior with the home environment during daily activities. A novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique is used to analyses this data and detect the behavioral anomalies, whose history is presented through a dashboard to the clinicians. Differently from related works, SmartFABER can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level. Results We have fully implemented the system and evaluated it using real datasets, partly generated by performing activities in a smart home laboratory, and partly acquired during several months of monitoring of the instrumented home of a senior diagnosed with MCI. Experimental results, including comparisons with other activity recognition techniques, show the effectiveness of SmartFABER in terms of recognition rates. "

But the creation and safeguarding of valuable personal characteristics cannot be measured unambiguously. This paper describes the analysis of linear partial information (LPI analysis) for systematically exploiting fuzzy measurements bearing on personal characteristics like health and education. Specifically, \{LPI\} analysis is applied in the evaluation of a measure designed to improve the health of a particular group of people, ergotherapy for the elderly, say. The simple disability index developed by Wright at York serves to illustrate the fuzziness of output measurement. In its ordinal version, it tends to assign elderly individuals to the ‘no change’ category with much higher frequency than in its semi-cardinal version. In a first round, the two versions are assumed to constitute upper and lower bounds for true probabilities of ‘improvement’, ‘no change’, and ‘deterioration’. These bounds, being linear partial information, are used to derive a set of admissible distributions over the three states. The set can be reduced to the finite set of decision-relevant extremal distributions if the decision maker's problem is viewed as a game against Nature. He will then select the alternative resulting in the distribution which guarantees him maximum expected utility. Such a choice amounts to applying the MaxEmin criterion, a natural generalisation of traditional criteria for the case of partial uncertainty rather than risk on the one and complete uncertainty on the other hand. In a second round, the two versions of the York index are treated as two separate sources of information, but of differing reliability. Again, \{LPI\} analysis allows knowledge of the type, ‘index A is more dependable than index B’ to be included in the evaluation of the proposed measure. In this particular example, taking the softness of the data into due account adds rather than detracts from the firmness of the recommendation arrived at. In conclusion, it appears that \{LPI\} analysis could vastly expand the scope of cost-benefit analysis, particularly in the domain of human resources, where output measurement is fuzzy by its very nature.

Localisation errors were exacerbated by initial hand-position to the right of the body-midline, and reduced by the leftwards initial hand-position. Moreover, for the visual neglect patients, mere presence of ambient vision worsened localisation errors. These results demonstrate that although hand-pointing to sounds has often been considered a straightforward approach to investigate sound-localisation abilities in brain-damaged patients, in some patients it may actually reveal localisation deficits that reflect a combination of impaired spatial-hearing and spatial biases from other sensory modalities (i.e., vision and proprioception).

Blood pressure was measured by a digital monitor. Particle concentrations (PM10) were obtained from the \{AIRAQ\} association that operates a local monitoring network of the air quality. To represent the ambient urban air pollution, stations had to be sufficiently correlated (i.e., correlation &gt;0.70) and to have sufficiently similar mean levels of pollution. Linear regression was used to model the association between concentrations of particles (PM10) and systolic blood pressure. We observed associations between the fifth lag hour and systolic blood pressure for an increase of 10 µg/m3 of \{PM10\} (ß=-1.12, 95% confidence interval: [-1.90; -0.30]). Despite contradictory results, fine particles must be considered nowadays as a major component of atmospheric air pollution in which everything must be put into practice in terms of public health actions in order to protect the general population and particularly the elderly group.

Many clinicians assume these patients walk slower to improve their stability, just as healthy people slow down when walking across ice. However, walking slower also leads to greater variability, which is often assumed to imply deteriorated stability. If this were true, then slowing down would be completely antithetical to the goal of maintaining stability. This study sought to resolve this paradox by directly quantifying the sensitivity of the locomotor system to local perturbations that are manifested as natural kinematic variability. Eleven young healthy subjects walked on a motorized treadmill at five different speeds. Three-dimensional movements of a single marker placed over the first thoracic vertebra were recorded during continuous walking. Mean stride-to-stride standard deviations and maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were computed for each time series to quantify the variability and local dynamic stability, respectively, of these movements. Quadratic regression analyses of the dependent measures vs. walking speed revealed highly significant U shaped trends for all three mean standard deviations, but highly significant linear trends, with significant or nearly significant quadratic terms, for five of the six finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Subjects exhibited consistently better local dynamic stability at slower speeds for these five measures. These results support the clinically based intuition that people who are at increased risk of falling walk slower to improve their stability, even at the cost of increased variability. "

The increase in political power in some intermediate income segments could induce a movement in the direction of dismantling privileges created for the rich or to restrict policies in favor of the poor. However, in the presence of significant inequality, it is difficult for society to come to a consensus regarding reforms that, if approved, would dismantle privileges and benefit the majority. Given this impossibility, the rational strategy for each group is to demand more benefits for themselves. As such, the tendency is for the distributive conflict to increase over time. Many government programs are created to benefit the middle class. The participation of this class in the distributive conflict intensifies the dispute for income in society and its adverse effects on economic growth. "

Advanced societies should face the challenge posed by an ageing society. Because of the scale of the challenge, all of society’s resources –including technology– should be used. The high degree of awareness of ageing among persons working in the social, medical and pharmaceutical fields, among others, is evident. However, the use of technology has tended to be neglected. Fortunately, this scenario is changing, and the first steps are being made towards the use of technology in ageing. Essentially, this change in attitude has been favored by two factors: a) \{EU\} research and development policies, which from the beginning of the 1990s developed the «Technology Initiative for Disabled and Elderly» (TIDE) programme, and have subsequently continued to stimulate research and development activities in this field through several programmes. These programmes have been reflected in subsequent national and regional \{EU\} programmes, and b) the discovery of a new, untapped market with millions of potential customers, where everything remains to be done. In this context, the present article analyzes the penetration of technology amongst the elderly, the usefulness of technology for this population, reference models that are starting to be implemented in some countries, some examples of specific results of research, and ethical issues in technology, among others.

Tissue probability map analysis showed that the highest rates of \{GM\} atrophy in this age range were localized in primary cortices, the angular and superior parietal gyri, the orbital part of the prefrontal cortex, and in the hippocampal region. There was no significant interaction between “Sex” and “Age” for any of the tissue volumes, as well as for any of the tissue probability maps. These findings indicate that brain atrophy during the seventh and eighth decades of life is ubiquitous and proceeds at a rate that is not modulated by “Sex”. "

However, pervasive age stereotypes still exist that limit the agency and self-perception of older people, and part of the experience of new aging is to actively combat such negative stereotypes. The purpose of this study is to explore how lifelong learning and a degree attainment in midlife become embedded into new aging practices. The study will focus on a specific group of aging workers who attained a Master's degree from Finnish universities in their fifties. In order to better understand the aging experiences of these older graduates, this study seeks to address how they construct the meaning of aging in relation to their own educational and professional status. The data consist of 14 life-history interviews, which were analyzed as narrative identity performances. Differentiating oneself from the stereotype of physical and mental decline and positioning oneself in a favorable way in inter-generational relations were common ways of approaching aging. Age-negotiation and ambivalence about aging were expressed by structuring narratives around clear oppositions and contradictions. University studies at age 50 + became a talking point in countering cultural age-stereotypes, because it showed that aging workers could still accomplish significant goals and “renew” oneself intellectually. University studies also enabled collaboration with the younger generation and the breaking of narrow age boundaries. "

The life course perspective explains their decisions based on past behaviors and is consistent with how they have lived their lives. We suggest that age norms determine the public's perceptions that casino gambling is problematic for older people. Results are consistent with cross-sectional surveys that find no evidence that older adults participate more often in or have greater problems with gambling than any other age group. Public concerns and media images may be based on socially constructed assumptions and fears. "

The aims of this study were to explore the relationship between hematologic parameters and insulin resistance, and to establish a gerontologic profile for following studies. Methods Residents aged over 40 years in 3 major townships in I-Lan County participating in the Adult Health Examination were invited for the study. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) was done according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), and subjects with the highest tertile of HOMA-IR were defined as being insulin resistant. Hematologic parameters including white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, and platelet count were measured for comparisons. Results A total of 857 subjects (mean age, 64.6 ± 11.2 years; male/female, 373/484) participated in this study. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.5 ± 3.7 kg/m2, and 42.4% of them were obese and 21.8% were overweight. The overall prevalence of \{DM\} was 15.4% (7.7% were previously diagnosed and 7.7% were newly diagnosed), and impaired fasting glucose was 7.2%. Trend analyses confirmed that age, BMI, HOMA-IR, \{WBC\} and platelet counts were significantly increased as glycemic metabolism exacerbated (p = 0.007, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Compared with insulin-sensitive subjects, insulin-resistant subjects were more likely to be females (70.2% vs. 49.7%, p &lt; 0.001), and had significantly higher \{BMI\} (26.2 ± 3.9 kg/m2 vs. 23.7 ± 3.3 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), HOMA-IR (3.6 ± 3.5 vs. 0.7 ± 0.3, p 0.001), \{WBC\} count (6686.9 ± 1889.2/mm3 vs. 5942.9 ± 1740.4/mm3, p &lt; 0.001), and platelet count (243.5 ± 70.9 × 103/mm3 vs. 231.0 ± 62.2 × 103/mm3, p = 0.011), but not age (64.5 ± 11.0 years vs. 64.6 ± 11.4 years, p = 0.93) or \{RBC\} count (4.6 ± 0.6 M/mm3 vs. 4.6 ± 0.6 M/mm3, p = 0.76). When age and sex were controlled, HOMA-IR significantly correlated with \{WBC\} count (? = 0.23, p &lt; 0.001) and platelet count (? = 0.09, p = 0.007). However, by multiple logistic regression, female gender, overweight and obesity, and elevated \{WBC\} count were all found to be independent risk factors of insulin resistance, but age, \{RBC\} and platelet counts were not. Conclusion Elevated \{WBC\} count but not \{RBC\} count was significantly associated with insulin resistance and glycemic metabolism. The relationship between platelet count and insulin resistance deserves further investigations. "

They are associated with and perhaps caused by specific infections, most notably the ubiquitous Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). One of these tumors, called African Burkitt's lymphoma, is clearly caused by \{EBV\} infection among persons who have had repeated malaria infections and have deficient immune protection on that basis. High-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas also occur among persons with rare genetic syndromes, and some studies have suggested a link with cigarette smoking. High-grade lymphomas occur twice as frequently among men as among women, and occur more often in Los Angeles County and especially in San Francisco than in other regions of the country. They appear as commonly in all races and all social classes, but risk is higher among young adult males and among the elderly. The increased frequency of this class of non-Hodgkin lymphomas among men, the high incidence in San Francisco, the increased frequency among young men and the elderly, and the presence of high-risk census tracts in and around West Hollywood all indicate that the pattern of occurrence of this malignancy is dominated by immunodeficiency as a result of AIDS.

Of the pollutants measured, ambient PM2.5 was most consistently associated with parameters of respiratory health.

The early increase of 5.5% in Vienna at a lag of 2 days in males and of 5.6% per 10 µg/m3 at a lag of 3 days in females was not observed in a nearby rural area. Another increase of respiratory admissions (mainly COPD) was observed after a lag of 10–11 days. A time series on a panel of 56 healthy preschool children showed a significant impact of the carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5 on tidal breathing pattern assessed by inductive plethysmography. In repeated oscillometric measurements of respiratory resistance in 164 healthy elementary school children not only immediate responses to fine particulates were found but also latent ones, possibly indicating inflammatory changes in airways. It may be speculated that the improvements of urban air quality prevented measurable effects on respiratory mortality. More sensitive indicators, however, still show acute impairments of respiratory function and health in elderly and children which are associated with fine particulates and subfractions related to motor traffic.

The study setting was metropolitan Mexico City, a high altitude city situated in a valley, with an estimated 20 million inhabitants, large socioeconomic gradients, and ozone levels frequently exceeding international standards. We stratified daily deaths by six census-derived socioeconomic indicators, based on characteristics of the county where decedents lived. We used Poisson regression to model the association between daily mortality and ozone levels (on the day of death and the previous day) in separate models, stratified by area socioeconomic level and age, and controlling for time trends and temperature. Ozone was positively associated with total mortality [0.65% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02%, 1.28%] and for mortality among those over age 65 [1.39% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.51%, 2.28%]. Associations between ozone and all-age mortality did not show any consistent patterns according to socioeconomic gradients. We conclude that elderly people are at higher risk for ozone-associated mortality. Though county-level social indicators in Mexico City were not strong markers of vulnerability to ozone-associated acute mortality in this analysis, complex associations between individual and area-level factors may exist that would require additional data and further analyses to elucidate.

In fact, pain was called the “sixth vital sign” by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in 2001. The continued challenge of effective, safe analgesia in the outpatient setting has promoted the use of various devices designed to deliver local anesthetic directly to the surgical site. We endeavored to evaluate the efficacy of one such device currently in use. Type of Study: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. Methods: In this study, 49 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patients and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Group 1 (control group) received no catheter. Group 2 (placebo group) received an infusion catheter filled with saline. Group 3 (experimental group) received the same catheter filled with 0.25% bupivacaine solution. All patients received an ipsilateral femoral nerve block with 30 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine intra-articular injection. Patients recorded narcotic consumption and pain levels on visual analogue scales twice a day for 4 days after surgery. The catheters were removed on day 4 and physical therapy performance was recorded. The patients were then asked to continue to record pain ratings and medication consumption for an additional 4 days after catheter removal. All patients underwent bone—patellar tendon—bone \{ACL\} reconstruction by the senior author (P.D.F.). Seven patients were excluded from the study for ineffective femoral nerve block or catheter disconnection or occlusion. Narcotic consumption and the maximum, minimum, and median pain ratings were analyzed by analysis of variance. Results: Median pain ratings show lower pain levels (P &lt; .03) for both catheter groups versus the control group. No significant differences were found between the catheter groups for the median pain ratings, but lower maximum pain ratings were seen in the bupivacaine group compared with both placebo and no-catheter control subjects. Postoperative narcotic consumption was also lower in both catheter groups versus control subjects (P &lt; .03). Physical therapy data revealed no difference in range of motion on postoperative day 4. More patients were able to perform straight leg raises during the first therapy session in both the saline placebo catheter group (70%) and bupivacaine group (72%) compared with the control group (50%). Conclusions: The data suggest some element of placebo benefit at median pain ratings but a protective effect of the bupivacaine at maximum pain levels. "

Relationships between demographics and select behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity) with \{PSA\} scores are also considered. The setting was the 1999 Huntsman World Senior Games in St. George, Utah. Subjects' analysis is based on 536 men aged 50 years and older completing a questionnaire and receiving free screening, including a PSA. Methods: Frequency distributions, multiple regression techniques, and the Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: A positive relationship was observed between increasing age groups and mean \{PSA\} scores (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square: 53.8, p&lt;0.0001). After adjusting for age, none of the personal risk factor indicators (i.e., cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and percent body fat) were related to \{PSA\} scores. Other factors not related to \{PSA\} scores after adjusting for age were race, marital status, education, history of chronic disease, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity. Conclusion: Because risk indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and percent body fat are associated with dietary fat intake, their failure to be related with \{PSA\} scores makes it further unclear how this commonly accepted modifiable risk factor for prostate cancer may influence the disease.

Discussed briefly are the implications of these duties for nursing programs when disabled students are treated less favourably than their peers such as through a failure to make reasonable adjustments within the curriculum. Part \{IV\} of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995), as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (2001), identifies such statutory duties and rights for nursing programs. For the purpose of this article, access to nursing education by disabled students and the subsequent service provision for these students in nursing programs is described as a game, using a conceptual framework by North. Different roles identified within the formal and informal legal rules, such as attitudes toward disabled students in nursing programs throughout the UK, are discussed briefly using this framework. It is noted that the rules of the game very much mirror the rules under Part \{II\} and Part \{III\} of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) relating to disabled employees and disabled service users of public services, in force since December 1996. It is argued that lecturers and senior management teams in both nursing education and the health services occupy historical roles in the efficient design and playing of this game. The next step is to gradually align informal rules with formal rules, which can only be done through proper and correct education of key players. "

Furthermore, the effects of fuel poverty on household occupancy have not been addressed formerly. This paper employs a new national household survey of Ireland—a country with a level of fuel poverty similar to Britain—to examine these key issues. Both self-reported and objective measures of thermal comfort are utilised, and the study pays particular attention to the age profile of those affected by thermal discomfort. The results show, inter alia, that two-thirds of fuel-poor householders demonstrate cold strain, and over half of elderly households endure inadequate ambient household temperatures during winter. "

These services are the result of collaboration among various stakeholders, enabled by the notion of collaborative ambient assisted living ecosystem. A 3-layered model is adopted for the architecture: Infrastructure layer, Care and Assistance Services layer, and Ambient Assisted Living ecosystem layer. The involved actors and their relationships are modeled as part of the architecture implementation specification. An example of service design in this context is also presented. "

Aim This paper presents the methodology of the quantitative \{PROHIBIT\} survey and outlines the findings on infection control (IC) structure and organization including management's support at the hospital level. Methods Hospitals in 34 countries were invited to participate between September 2011 and March 2012. Respondents included \{IC\} personnel and hospital management. Findings Data from 309 hospitals in 24 countries were analysed. Hospitals had a median (interquartile range) of four \{IC\} nurses (2–6) and one \{IC\} doctor (0–2) per 1000 beds. Almost all hospitals (96%) had defined \{IC\} objectives, which mainly addressed hand hygiene (87%), healthcare-associated infection reduction (84%), and antibiotic stewardship (66%). Senior management provided leadership walk rounds in about half of hospitals, most often in Eastern and Northern Europe, 65% and 64%, respectively. In the majority of hospitals (71%), sanctions were not employed for repeated violations of \{IC\} practices. Use of sanctions varied significantly by region (P &lt; 0.001), but not by countries' healthcare expenditure. Conclusion There is great variance in \{IC\} staffing and policies across Europe. Some areas of practice, such as hand hygiene, seem to receive considerably more attention than others that are equally important, such as antibiotic stewardship. Programmes in \{IC\} suffer from deficiencies in human resources and local policies, ubiquitous factors that negatively impact on \{IC\} effectiveness. Strengthening of \{IC\} policies in European hospitals should be a public health priority. "

In this paper, we describe a dense sensing approach for falls detection in an ambient assisted living environment such as a room, hall or a walkway. We utilize a smart carpet consisting of an array of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags arranged in a 2-dimensional grid to create an unobtrusive monitoring area and to detect falls among other activities. In particular, we propose an algorithm based on a heuristic and machine learning to detect ‘long-lie’ situations. The proposed algorithm minimizes the effects of noise present in the \{RFID\} information by relying on eight features extracted using only binary tag observation information from a possible location of a fall on the smart carpet. By evaluating the proposed approach with broadly scripted activities, which included a complex set of walking patterns, we show that the proposed algorithm depicts a good overall performance of 93% F-score.

Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfate was also measured daily (1986–1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec). We used coefficient of haze (COH), extinction coefficient, and sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine particles for days that were missing. We estimated associations between cause-specific mortality and PM2.5, PM10, predicted fine particles and fine sulfate particles, total suspended particles, coefficient of haze, extinction coefficient, and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station. We selected a set of underlying causes of death, as recorded on the death certificates, as the endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and gaseous pollutants. We found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from respiratory diseases and diabetes. The mean percentage change in daily mortality (MPC), evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day of death and the preceding 2 days, for deaths from respiratory diseases was MPCCOH=6.90% (95% CI: 3.69–10.21%), \{MPCPredicted\} PM2.5= 9.03% (95% CI: 5.83– 12.33%), and \{MPCSutton\} sulfate=4.64% (95% CI: 2.46–6.86%). For diabetes, the corresponding estimates were MPCCOH=7.50% (95% CI: 1.96–13.34%), \{MPCPredicted\} PM2.5=7.59% (95% CI: 2.36–13.09%), and \{MPCSutton\} sulfate=4.48% (95% CI: 1.08–7.99%). Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death, we found consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and coronary artery diseases. Associations with sulfate mass were also found among elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer. These associations were consistent with linear relationships. The associations found for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases, especially in the elderly, are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by which ambient particles may increase daily mortality. The positive associations found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis proposed by Frank and Tankersley, who suggested that persons in failing health may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating physiological set points. The association with diabetes may be interpreted in light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology. Further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted. "

Objectives of the exposure study were to determine the feasibility of performing \{PM\} exposure assessment upon an elderly population and establishing relationships between the various exposure measures including personal monitoring. PM2.5 was determined to be the dominant outdoor size fraction (0.83 PM2.5/PM10 mass ratio by dichot monitoring). Individual 24-h PM1.5 personal exposures ranged from 12 to 58 µg m-3.

We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in patients who have Workers' Compensation claims. This minimum 2-year follow-up study analyzed the occupational, functional, and objective results of patients who underwent arthroscopic-assisted anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Twenty-two patients with Workers' Compensation claims representing 5% of patients who underwent \{ACL\} reconstruction at our institution between 1987 and 1995 were included in the current study. All reconstructions were performed by the senior author (B.R.B.) using arthroscopic-assisted techniques (single and double-incision) with bone–patellar tendon–bone autografts followed by an accelerated rehabilitation protocol. Postoperative follow-up physical examinations revealed a negative anterior drawer in 19 patients (91%), a negative Lachman in 15 patients (68%), and a negative pivot shift in 21 patients (96%). The KT-1000 arthrometric evaluation at follow-up showed a mean maximum manual difference of 1.9 mm with 15 patients (68%) having a maximum manual difference of =3 mm and 7 patients (32%) from 3 to 5 mm. The mean postoperative scores for the Hospital for Special Surgery scoring scale was 86, Noyes Sports activity scale 81, Noyes \{ADL\} score 36, Noyes Problem with Sports 75, Noyes Sports Function score 87, Lysholm score 82, and the Tegner score 5.9. The Noyes Occupational rating system increased from preoperative 48 to 60 postoperatively and the Noyes Job Title rating system score remained at 5 after surgery. Functional testing revealed mean deficits of no more than 9% between the reconstructed and normal knees. SF-36 testing revealed significantly higher scores in the Role Physical and General Health categories and a significantly lower score in the Mental Health category when compared with United States norms. Subjective evaluation revealed that 95% of the patients would undergo a similar procedure if faced with a similar injury to the contralateral knee in the future. The results of the current study show that \{ACL\} reconstruction leads to predictable functional and occupational results in those patients with work-related injuries. All of our patients were able to return to work. The hypothesis that Workers' Compensation compromises the results of \{ACL\} reconstruction was not observed in this study.

abstract = "In recent years at the Yale School of Medicine, operative services work volume has increased dramatically, including a 24% increase in cases and a 17% increase in inpatient discharges. At the same time, ambulatory care has surged, reducing hospital length of stay by 26%. The institution has also been through 2 budget reviews, which reduced the operating budget by 10% each time. The result has been a rise in patient acuity, a rise in patient volume, an increase in outpatient work, and a reduction in hospital personnel available to participate in patient care. As a result, the hours of our residents have increased as they have assumed responsibility for both the volume increase and the decrease in hospital personnel. At the same time, the number of house staff positions has been reduced as a result of a training program amalgamation, and preliminary positions and time spent by specialty categorical residents in general surgery have decreased. Therefore, a work redesign project was undertaken to examine the activities of first-year trainees. The tasks of first-year trainees were divided into educational benefit (OR, rounds, conferences), service (paperwork, finding films), and tasks that were indeterminate. The service tasks were redistributed within a new service structure to include a physician associate (PA) role. The trainees were then available for educational activities, including the OR. The relationships among the nurse, PA, attending surgeon, senior resident, and patient were redefined to emphasize the role of the trainee. Under the new system, the \{PA\} spanned the roles of the attending surgeon, trainees, and nurses during the day to support managed care pathways, paperwork, nursing care plans, and questions that in the past were directed to the house staff. While reporting directly to the associate program director, the \{PA\} performed the patient care tasks on assignment from both the house staff and attending surgeons during the day, leaving little in the way of accumulated tasks for the evening. The \{PA\} also participated in the check-out rounds of the house staff and in the nursing shift meetings. Physician associates were hired for the major general surgery services and did not perform night duty. They were never perceived as replacements for house staff but rather as health care workers in a new role as defined by work redesign. The first-year trainees continued to perform 80–100 cases per year despite drastic changes in the work expectations that otherwise would have fallen to them. The evaluation of services by the residents increased substantially. Nursing evaluation of the program was completely positive, and the attending surgeons found the new system completely acceptable. Work redesign is a tactic that can preserve the educational aspects of resident training even in the face of severe resource constraints and conflicting demands on time. "

This article establishes a rough baseline for the quality of care, primarily preventive care, received by older women compared to older men, using selected measures and data of the 2004 National Healthcare Quality Report and National Healthcare Disparities Report. It highlights significant differences between women and men, as well as differences for racial, ethnic, and educational subgroups. Generally, older non-Hispanic white women frequently score higher than their Hispanic and non-Hispanic black counterparts, and more educated women often score significantly higher than their less-educated peers on several measures of quality of care. Compared to their male counterparts, older women are significantly less likely to have any colorectal screening test, to keep high blood pressure under control, and to receive aspirin or beta-blockers upon hospital admission or discharge for acute myocardial infarction. Results are mixed for the process measures related to diabetes, but improvements are clearly needed toward increased rates of eye and foot examinations. Rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are low but can be improved through Medicare-covered services. We also found that older women are screened less often for breast cancer than those ages 40 to 64. There is still a pervasive lack of knowledge in the research and clinical communities about the unique health care needs of and appropriate processes of care for older adults. More research needs to focus on the quality of care for this growing population in order to allow the development of geriatric-based quality measures and models of care that will set the standards of healthcare for older adults in general, and older women in particular.

This technology offers significant flexibility in implementation (distance learning, independent study, learning laboratories, group instruction). The Medical Nutrition Curriculum Initiative is expanding its scope to provide an easily transportable curriculum to \{US\} dietetics programs and colleges and universities offering human nutrition courses. The series of interactive CD-ROM programs spans ten clinical topics: Nutritional Anemias, Stress, Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, Maternal and Infant, Childhood and Adolescence, Aging, Nutritional Supplements and Fortified Foods, and Sports Nutrition. Nutritional biochemistry relevant to health and disease, dietary recommendations for treatment and preventive care, and related clinical issues are covered. The virtual case enables the student to practice nutrition-related skills in a patient setting. The introductory nutrition version targets first- or second-year nutrition students and includes a nutrition video game. The dietetics training version aims at senior or graduate nutrition students and has a stronger medical nutrition therapy emphasis within a nutritional biochemistry context. To maximize their effectiveness as educators of the next generation of nutrition professionals, nutrition and dietetics educators must be aware of the new advanced technology opportunities available in nutrition education and training.

Sixty-six healthy control subjects or patients suffering from inflammation participated in the study. In both heat shocked (HS) and non-HS conditions, the percentage of Hsp27 producing lymphocytes as well as the intensity of Hsp27 in lymphocytes and monocytes were negatively influenced by age. The basal levels and also the levels of Hsp27 production after \{HS\} were higher for monocytes compared to lymphocytes. In addition, we found that \{HS\} resulted in a small but significant increase in the levels of Hsp27 in lymphocytes whereas a significant decrease in Hsp27 was noticed for monocytes. In conclusion, results presented herein provide evidence in support of an age-related decrease in the level of Hsp27, which disappeared in the presence of inflammation. Several relationships between the circulating levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a with the various Hsp27 determinations were observed, indicating that cytokines are able to influence the production of Hsp27.

From the standpoints of both relative risk and attributable risk, the public health burden of ambient \{PM\} exposure is potentially greatest in elderly adults with underlying cardiopulmonary illness. Recent experimental data suggest that PM-borne transition metals have toxicity that could be mechanistically relevant to PM-related epidemiological findings. These data may prove to be especially relevant in elderly adults with cardiopulmonary illness. At the same time, important uncertainties remain in the epidemiological and experimental databases, such that the true degree of correspondence between the two is not yet known. In our opinion, this combination of emerging experimental–epidemiological coherence and remaining uncertainty imparts high priority to further research into the health effects of PM-borne transition metals. This research should not be confined to the respiratory system. Rather, it should examine the entire heart–lung axis and should probably consider other body systems (e.g. the vascular system) as well. In this research, close interdisciplinary communication should be sustained and experimental and epidemiological approaches should be coordinated to the maximum feasible extent. "

abstract = "If one is to understand the current status and climate of the U.S. medical system, it is essential to place it in the appropriate historical perspective. One must look at how the medical system evolved into the current situation, what the characteristics of that situation are, and what can be expected in the years to come. During the first half of the twentieth century, the practice of medicine was simple and straightforward. Patients had direct relationships with physicians and had ultimate choice in whom to see. Most physicians were in solo practice and received payments from patients on rendering service. Fees were relatively small, and there were frequent instances in which payments could not be made and services were provided in exchange for goods, future payments, and, not infrequently, the mere promise of payments that never materialized. Nevertheless, most physicians survived economically and enjoyed a high regard in their communities. At the same time, the public's expectations of what medical care could provide was modest. Physicians were viewed as caring individuals rather than miracle workers. They practiced autonomously and made decisions without the benefit of complex testing and procedures. In general, medical care was sought only for serious illness. Hospitals existed in urban settings and served large population areas. After World War \{II\} and up to 1965, changes began occurring in the public's attitude toward medical care. With significant developments in medical technology; developments in drugs, most notably antibiotics; and the experience gained in treating casualties during the war, Americans sought and soon demanded more from their physicians, with growing expectations for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, costs began to increase. Medical care was not only available to the rich, but also became regarded as a right to all. Health insurance was developed by hospital organizations and the medical profession. Patients paid only a portion of their bill, and the ever-increasing demand for services combined with the growth in payments by third parties allowed for progressive increase in prices. 7 During this era, there was a large migration to the suburbs with patients no longer wanting to travel long distances to receive medical and hospital care. A result was the growth of community hospitals financed by the expanding insurance payments supported by ever-increasing premiums, resulting in double digit inflation within the health sector. Before President Clinton's efforts at health care reform, President Truman was an earnest champion of reform to stem the tide of the “runaway” health care costs of the late 1940s, during which health care accounted for less than 4% of the gross domestic product. Meanwhile, unions and employers became involved in underwriting some of the costs of health insurance premiums, and health care first became a significant issue at the bargaining table. With the absence of checks on supply and demand, however, costs continued to soar. In 1965, Medicare was created. Health care was deemed a right for the elderly, the poor, and the disabled, and government was called on to provide the financing. Suddenly, even those unable to afford private insurance were now covered. Technology flourished fostered by the perception and demand of the public that the more physicians could do, the better they would be. To a large extent, that was true. Between 1965 and the early 1980s, dramatic technologic advances were made in the practice of surgery and noninvasive imaging such as endoscopy, ultrasound, and the early development of computed tomography scanning. These technologies were expensive and were, in large part, financed by the government and insurance industry. The concept of cost-based reimbursement flourished so that the more physicians charged, the more they were paid. Physicians were recruited by hospitals to bring and refer their patients. The more the physicians did and the longer the length of hospital stay, the greater the payment. Because the increased cost did not have a direct impact on the patients, there was little resistance to this philosophy. The new technologies led to a dramatic shift in the physician population. There was a large increase in specialists who could use and provide the new types of technology patients and hospitals desired. Eventually the “me too” philosophy of hospitals led to an oversupply of beds and unnecessary duplication of services. Business ultimately called a halt to this runaway growth. At a time when medical care was approaching 9% to 10% of the gross domestic product, industry, which was paying for much of the health care premiums, saw those costs threatening pretax profits to the extent that insolvency was threatened for some of the largest employers. In 1965, Chrysler Corporation reported spending 8% of pretax profits for health care benefits for their employees. This figure rose to 26% by 1982 with projections of up to 65%% by 1995 (M Brotman, personal communication). This drain on profits had to be curtailed and eventually led to the current managed care era beginning in the early 1980s. Despite these efforts, health care's growth as a portion of the gross domestic product continued to increase to 13.7% in 1994. The rate of growth, however, finally slowed from 0.5% per year to less than 0.1%% in 1994. 9 With the advent of the 1980s, constraints were initiated on hospitals and physicians. Initially, noneconomic controls appeared, such as peer review and utilization management. The early efforts to contain costs led to the origination of the first health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in California, soon to be followed by more pervasive development in other parts of the United States, such as Minneapolis. Economic constraints on hospitals were led by the federal government's development of prospective payment by diagnostically related groups. Suddenly, hospitals were no longer paid based on costs but received a relatively fixed payment commensurate with the patient's diagnosis regardless of services provided. Length of stay became a burden. The longer patients remained hospitalized, the more services provided and the greater the potential loss. Because this initial new payment paradigm did not affect physicians, there was an obvious divergence of goals between hospitals and physicians in the approach to patient care resulting in growing acrimony, which to some extent exists even today. Eventually, physicians suffered the same restrictions on reimbursement. Medicare instituted the resource-based relative value scale replacing payment based on usual and customary reimbursement. This change did reduce the dramatic discrepancies in payments for procedural versus cognitive skills but resulted in the reduction of all levels of reimbursement on what many would charge are unfair and erroneous principles. This was rapidly followed by the dramatic curtailment of payments from private insurance carriers, the rapid reduction and practical demise of the fee-for-service form of payment, and the development and growth of alternate payment strategies that now constitute the economic cornerstone of medical practice in the United States. At the same time, the Health Care Financing Administration initiated the concept of volume performance standards that placed inherent stopgaps on the overall payment for specific services believed to be in excess of predetermined quotas based on previous experience. This change resulted in further reductions in per capita payment for such services so as to remain budget neutral. With this background, the stage was set for the dramatic changes in the marketplace that now exist in medical care. "

Identifying the predictors of stress as well as coping strategies used can allow for the implementation of appropriate coping interventions to assist in the management of stress in nursing students. Mixed methods research that has been undertaken to gain an understanding about student stress, especially juxtaposing generic versus accelerated nursing students could not be identified. Objectives (1) Identify predictors of stress between accelerated and generic Baccalaureate Nursing (BSN) students; and (2) Describe stressors and coping strategies used by accelerated students in comparison with generic students. Design Embedded mixed methods study. Setting Accelerated and generic \{BSN\} third- and fourth-year nursing students at two Midwestern universities. Participants 210 participants: accelerated (n = 75) and generic (n = 135). Methods A questionnaire packet, including demographics, history of depression, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and open-ended questions were administered to students at the end of a class. Simultaneous multiple regression was used to examine predictors of stress. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Results Predictors of stress for both the accelerated and generic groups included history of depression, year in the program, emotional support, and self-esteem. Fear of failure and clinical incompetence, problematic relationships, and time management issues were identified as major stressors. Coping strategies used by both groups included positive thinking and social support. Conclusions Senior students with a history of depression, low self-esteem, and little social support were more likely to experience high levels of stress. This gives educators the potential to identify at risk students and establish stress reduction programs. Encouraging students to use individualized coping strategies will be beneficial. "

Management practices vary widely and may abrogate, uphold or enhance the autonomy of residents. When various polarities of autonomy are examined (i.e., decisional vs. executional, direct vs. delegated, competent vs. incapacitated, authentic vs. inauthentic, immediate vs. long range, and positive vs. negative), then staffs concept of autonomy is revealed as unidimensional, overly simplified, and taken-for-granted.

A fundamental re-thinking of the concept of custodial care is required. "

Ozone levels were obtained from 22 monitoring stations maintained by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment for the period January 1, 1983 to December 31, 1988. Daily levels of sulfates were recorded at nine monitoring stations representing three different networks operated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada. Positive and statistically significant associations were found between hospital admissions and both ozone and sulfates recorded on the day of admission and up to 3 days prior to the date of admission. Five percent of daily respiratory admissions in the months of May to August were associated with ozone, with sulfates accounting for an additional 1% of these admissions. Ozone was a stronger predictor of admissions than sulfates. Positive and statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) associations were observed between the ozone-sulfate pollution mix and admissions for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. Positive associations were also found in all age groups, with the largest impact on infants (15% of admissions associated with the ozone-sulfate pollution mix) and the least effects on the elderly (4%). Temperature had no effect on the air pollution-admission relationship. Ozone (lagged 1 day) and sulfates (lagged 1 day) displayed a positive association with respiratory admissions for 91 and 100% of the 168 acute care hospitals, respectively. Air pollution was not related to a class of nonrespiratory admissions, which served as a negative control, nor was it related to admissions in the winter-months of December to March, when ozone and sulfate levels are low and when people spend a considerable amount of time indoors.

abstract = "The widely accepted notion that certain individuals are more susceptible to air pollutants than others has been revitalized by recent epidemiology that strongly suggests that the elderly, particularly those with underlying cardiopulmonary diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infection), and children with asthma are more susceptible to the adverse outcomes associated with ambient particulate matter (PM). Pulmonary toxicologists have adopted ‘susceptibility’ as an issue that can be approached experimentally and have begun to develop as well as study more relevant animal models. These models may have specific genetic traits or cardiopulmonary impairments analogous to human diseases. The goal is to identify potential susceptibility characteristics and elucidate whether responsiveness is due to impair compensation or some unique mechanisms. Several rodent models have been used with PM: pulmonary vasculitis, bronchitis, COPD, allergic asthma, infectious lung diseases, systemic hypertension, and congestive heart disease. Transgenic and knockout mice are of growing interest but have seen limited use in air pollutants studies, with primary interest being directed to specific mechanistic questions. No model should be used without careful consideration of its strengths and limitations. However, when interpreted in the context of field and epidemiology findings, they may reveal generic susceptibility attributes or useful biomarkers. "

Contrary to earlier reports of inner-city elderly women, there was no evidence of pervasive isolation and longitudinal data indicated that \{SRO\} women had dynamic networks that allowed for the replacement of lost contacts with new ones. In comparing the sexes there were similarities in the various social network dimensions and the use of these networks to fulfill needs and cope with physical illness. Moreover, the similarities in life histories between the sexes would suggest that as women's life-styles in the general population come to approximate those of men, the social interactions of aging men and women may more closely resemble each other.

In the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), we investigated the short-term association between \{NO2\} and mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for NO2. In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. We combined the individual-city estimates of the concentration–response curves to get an overall NO2–mortality association in China. The averaged daily concentrations of \{NO2\} in the 17 Chinese cities ranged from 26 µg/m3 to 67 µg/m3. In the combined analysis, a 10-µg/m3 increase in two-day moving averaged \{NO2\} was associated with a 1.63% [95% posterior interval (PI), 1.09 to 2.17], 1.80% (95% PI, 1.00 to 2.59) and 2.52% (95% PI, 1.44 to 3.59) increase of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for ambient particles or sulfur dioxide (SO2). Older people appeared to be more vulnerable to \{NO2\} exposure. The combined concentration–response curves indicated a linear association. Conclusively, this largest epidemiologic study of \{NO2\} in Asian developing countries to date suggests that short-term exposure to \{NO2\} is associated with increased mortality risk. "

Similarly, those with first-hand experience in the field of healthcare realize that there are a host of factors that play a role in determining patient satisfaction; however, when all is said and done, it is the influence of nursing services that has by far the most significant impact. Most staff nurses have a general understanding of this importance, but many have a less than full appreciation of just how strong it is. Even more importantly, hospital boards, medical staffs, senior management, and nursing leadership need to have a clear understanding of this relationship since there is now ample evidence that as staff nurse job satisfaction goes, so goes patient satisfaction.

Their impact is pervasive yet this is not widely recognised at the level of health policy and priority. Musculoskeletal conditions are a diverse group of disorders with regard to pathophysiology but are linked anatomically and by their association with pain and impaired physical function; encompassing a spectrum of conditions, including inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout; age-related conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis; common conditions of unclear aetiology such as back pain and fibromyalgia; and those related to activity or injuries such as occupational musculoskeletal disorders, sports injuries or the consequences of falls and major trauma. The increasing number of older people and the changes in lifestyle throughout the world with increasing obesity and reduced physical activity mean that the burden on people and society will increase dramatically. The growing awareness of the burden increases the need for accurate measurement and assessment of the burden as well as measurement of the impact of any public health action.

abstract = "The condition of simulated or real manned spaceflight, i.e. thermally comfortable microgravitation (G ~ 0), is very similar to the intrauterine immersion to the amniotic fluid. Domination of fast muscle fibers and phasic movements forms the fetal strategy to survive in heating, strongly hypoxic, albeit normal for fetus, immersion. In adults, the adaptive response separately to microgravitation, heat stress and hypoxia also shifts muscle fiber properties to faster values. That allows to speculate about specific motor strategy induced by micro-or hypogravitation (fetal/microgravitation, or FM-strategy). After birth the newborn is subjected to a combined ‘sensory attack’ of Earth gravitation, cooler ambient temperature and normoxia which is actually hyperoxic for fetus. The process of parturition can be considered as equivalent to cosmonaut's/astronaut's transition from microgravitation back to Earth gravitation (G = 1) during landing. These factors also act simultaneously and constitute another set of sensory inputs with the effect that is opposite to the intrauterine condition. In normal gravitation, comfortable temperature and normoxia decreases the motor unit activity (MU) firing rate to a level, characteristic for the regular Earth condition. In contrast to ‘faster’ fetal adaptive motor response (microgravitation, heat, hypoxia), the post-natal adult set of conditions (lower, but still normal temperature, normoxia, 1G gravitation, healthy maturation) may represent the ‘Earth’ adaptive motor response, or the (gravitation/Earth, or GE-strategy). The motor system undergoes a second profound remodeling in older people during healthy ageing that results in further domination of slow muscle fibers and slowing down motor unit activity, simulating the condition of hypergravitation (G &gt; 1). Similar slowing adaptive responses are represented by cold and hyperoxia thus forming further motor strategy that could be named as SJ-strategy (after ‘slow’ and Jupiter – the most massive planet and the only planet with G &gt; 1 in the solar system). These strategies suppose that definite sensory inputs and conditions may substitute each other due to its equivalent action on the motor system. Thus, cold ‘sensory attack’ may serve as a ‘surrogate’ for gravitation because these two conditions exert equivalent stimulating action on muscle tone. In that respect long-term mild cooling exposures or shorter severe cold exposures may be considered as a prophylactic countermeasure against hazardous action of weightlessness. Also, combination of cooling sensory intervention with traditional and well- documented interventions (whole body vibration and stimulation of ‘support zone’ afferents) may elevate their anti-microgravitation efficiency.

Being ‘born with’ someone places actors in the continuing interdependence that is the basis of social life in a small-scale society. One's kinship bonds define the place in the life cycle, from dependent child to controlling ancestor. One's close senior kin are those who sustained life and gave protection when one was young and helpless. One's age mates, with whom one played as children, are those with whom the serious games of adulthood must be planned and staged. This chapter discusses the symbolic foundations of Kwaio kinship, conceptualizations and categories of kinship distance and kinship obligations, kinship and the social identity system, the behavioral wellsprings of kinship obligation and sentiment, and the uses of kinship in Kwaio society. The deep positive affect between close kin and the sense of transcendant moral obligation are tinged with resentment that can turn into conflict, and the bonds are strategically exploited for individual ends as well as for collective ones.

We have extended our original mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, among persons 65 years of age and older, for an additional 10 years (1990–2003) to assess whether these associations persisted and to investigate new health conditions. Methods and results We created subgroups of subjects diagnosed with major health conditions one year before death using billing and prescription data from the Quebec Health Insurance Plan. We used parametric log-linear Poisson models within the distributed lag non-linear models framework, that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily maximum temperature, for which we assessed associations with NO2, O3, CO, SO2, and particles with aerodynamic diameters 2.5 µm in diameter or less (PM2.5). We found positive associations between daily non-accidental mortality and all air pollutants but \{O3\} (e.g., for a cumulative effect over a 3-day lag, with a mean percent change (MPC) in daily mortality of 1.90% [95% confidence interval: 0.73, 3.08%] for an increase of the interquartile range (17.56 µ gm- 3) of NO2). Positive associations were found amongst persons having cardiovascular disease (cumulative \{MPC\} for an increase equal to the interquartile range of \{NO2\} = 2.67%), congestive heart failure (MPC = 3.46%), atrial fibrillation (MPC = 4.21%), diabetes (MPC = 3.45%), and diabetes and cardiovascular disease (MPC = 3.50%). Associations in the warm season were also found for acute and chronic coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cancer. There was no persuasive evidence to conclude that there were seasonal associations for cerebrovascular disease, acute lower respiratory disease (defined within 2 months of death), airways disease, and diabetes and airways disease. Conclusions These data indicate that individuals with certain health conditions, especially those with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cancer, may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution.

Tolerance to benzodiazepines can develop with repeated treatment; however, cross tolerance to neuroactive steroids does not develop, perhaps due to conformational changes in benzodiazepine, and not neuroactive steroid, binding sites. Three monkeys discriminated 0.178 mg/kg midazolam while responding under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of stimulus-shock termination. On separate occasions, dose-effect curves for midazolam and pregnanolone were determined when monkeys had not received chlordiazepoxide and when they received 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide 46 hours earlier; for some tests, flumazenil was given before determination of dose-effect curves. Midazolam and pregnanolone produced =80% midazolam-lever responding. When administered 46 h before sessions, chlordiazepoxide did not produce pregnanolone-lever responding; under those treatment conditions, midazolam dose-effect curves were shifted 2.8-fold rightward and pregnanolone dose-effect curves were not changed. Flumazenil antagonized midazolam; Schild (linear) analyses yielded slopes that were not different from unity and pA2 values of 7.46 when monkeys had not received chlordiazepoxide and 7.44 when they received chlordiazepoxide 46 h earlier. Flumazenil did not alter the effects of pregnanolone in chlordiazepoxide-treated monkeys. Thus, interactions between flumazenil and midazolam were not qualitatively or quantitatively changed in monkeys acutely tolerant to chlordiazepoxide, suggesting that mechanisms other than alterations of benzodiazepine binding sites account for the development of acute tolerance.

Furthermore, effects in the lungs, e.g. inflammatory effects, have not been substantiated at indoor relevant concentrations. Some VOCs, including formaldehyde, in combination may under certain environmental and occupational conditions result in reported sensory irritation. The odour thresholds of several \{VOCs\} are low enough to influence the perceived air quality that result in a number of acute effects from reported sensory irritation in eyes and airways and deterioration of performance. The odour perception (air quality) depends on a number of factors that may influence the odour impact. There is neither clear indication that office dust particles may cause sensory effects, even not particles spiked with glucans, aldehydes or phthalates, nor lung effects; some inflammatory effects may be observed among asthmatics. Ozone-initiated terpene reaction products may be of concern in ozone-enriched environments (=0.1 mg/m3) and elevated limonene concentrations, partly due to the production of formaldehyde. Ambient particles may cause cardio-pulmonary effects, especially in susceptible people (e.g. elderly and sick people); even, short-term effects, e.g. from traffic emission and candle smoke may possibly have modulating and delayed effects on the heart, but otherwise adverse effects in the airways and lung functions have not been observed. Secondary organic aerosols generated in indoor ozone-initiated terpene reactions appear not to cause adverse effects in the airways; rather the gaseous products are relevant. Combined exposure to particles and ozone may evoke effects in subgroups of asthmatics. Based on an analysis of thresholds for odour and sensory irritation selected compounds are recommended for measurements to assess the indoor air quality and to minimize reports of irritation symptoms, deteriorated performance, and cardiovascular and pulmonary effects.

The problem is framed by providing an overview of the \{AL\} industry and reviewing \{AL\} resident demographics and health status characteristics. The discussion section examines the pervasive involvement of physicians with \{AL\} residents, reviews professional position statements on health care in AL, and reviews the emerging AL-focused clinical literature. In conclusion, the paper proposes key elements of a research agenda including establishing baseline physician-AL activity levels, physician collaboration with mid-level practitioners, and exploring physician involvement in chronic care and health promotion in AL.

abstract = "Stereotypes of an asexual old age remain pervasive, shaping not only popular images of older people, but also research and policy agendas. However, older people's own attitudes towards the role and value of sex in later life remain relatively unexplored. This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative data to examine how sex is prioritised in middle age and later life. Data collection methods involved completion of two quality of life measures (WHOQOL-100 and \{WHOQOL\} Importance Scale), followed by semi-structured interviews. In total the sample comprised 69 individuals recruited from the age/sex register of a general practice in Sheffield in the UK. This paper will focus upon the accounts of 21 men and 23 women aged 50–92 years. Ratings of the importance of sex to participants were gathered from the \{WHOQOL\} Importance Scale; the in-depth interviews enabled the basis for this prioritisation to be explored. Analysis identified the following key themes. Participants who did not consider sex to be of any importance to them neither had a current sexual partner, nor felt that they would have another sexual partner in their lifetime. Indeed, all participants who had a current sexual partner attributed at least some importance to sex, with many rating sex as ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ important. However, experiencing barriers to being sexually active led them to place less importance on sex; this was particularly apparent when health problems and widowhood were experienced. Age was seen as facilitating coping when sex became less frequent, or stopped altogether. This was explained in terms of sexual desire decreasing with age (for some male participants), the cessation of sex being easier to cope with in a relationship of long duration and the expectation that sex will become less possible with ‘normal ageing’. The discussion considers the implications of these findings for this developing field. "

abstract = "Background Body temperature is an indicator of health status. However, thermoregulatory function is thought to decline with aging. Objectives To determine normal body temperature and the effects of age, sex, ambient temperature (AT), and body mass index (BMI) on normal oral temperatures (OTs). Design A prospective four group comparative descriptive design was used to compare four cohorts: young adults in summer, older adults in summer, young adults in winter, and older adults in winter. Methods The \{OT\} of 519 community dwelling older adults ages 65–95 and 540 younger adults ages 20–64 was compared. The \{OT\} was taken with an electronic thermometer between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. during summer and winter in 2007 in Taipei, Taiwan. Results There was no difference in mean \{OT\} between the &lt;65 and =65 groups measured during winter. However, the mean \{OT\} of the &lt;65 group was 0.11 °C lower than the =65 group measured in the summer. Subjects (=85 years) had a higher correlation coefficient (r = 0.48) between \{OT\} and \{AT\} than those in the 65–74 year older group (r = 0.31) and 75–84 year older group (r = 0.23). Moreover this study found that the mean \{OT\} of older females was higher than that of older males in both winter and summer cohorts. Finally, multiple regression analysis results indicated \{AT\} and sex were predictors of \{OT\} while age and \{BMI\} were not a significant predictor of OT. These four factors together accounted for 9.4% of the variance in the overall sample (age 20–95), 12.8%, in those 65–95 and 28.2% for those, =85 years old. Conclusions These findings help to clarify discrepancies in the literature. The \{OT\} of those over age 65 and those 20–64 was lower than the accepted 37 °C norm. However, “older is colder” does not apply to all older adults. Our findings indicate \{AT\} and sex rather than age alone account for temperature variation in older adults with normal baseline temperature. Further investigation is needed to identify potential risk factors of impaired thermoregulation in older adults. "

Tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) measurement is popular, but there is no consensus on whether it is as accurate as oral temperature (OT) for use with the elderly at varying ambient temperature levels. Objectives To test agreement between \{TMT\} and \{OT\} measurement of body temperature among an elderly population; and to explore whether agreement between the two sites depends on ambient temperature. Design A cross-sectional comparison study. Methods Two samples of older community-dwelling adults were recruited from 17 community senior citizen centers in Taipei, Taiwan in winter (n = 262) and summer (n = 257) of 2007. \{TMT\} and \{OT\} were simultaneously measured by electronic infrared ear thermometer and electronic digital thermometer. Ambient temperatures measured by digital thermo-hygrometer of the data collection setting were recorded when body temperature was taken. Results In winter mean \{TMT\} was 36.64 °C (S.D. 0.37), and mean \{OT\} was 36.74 °C (S.D. 0.18). In summer, the mean \{TMT\} was 37.05 °C (S.D. 0.30) and mean \{OT\} was 36.85 °C (S.D. 0.22). The relationship between \{TMT\} and \{OT\} were r = 0.42 (p &lt; 0.001) in winter and r = 0.57 (p &lt; 0.001) in summer. The values of \{OT\} were used as standard to assess the accuracy of the measurement. The bias between \{TMT\} and \{OT\} was -0.10 °C (S.D. 0.34) and 95% limits of agreement were 0.57 and -0.77 °C in winter; and bias was 0.20 °C (S.D. 0.25) and 95% limits of agreement were 0.69 and -0.29 °C in summer. The findings of this study demonstrate that the \{TMT\} has high variability that may under or over estimate body temperatures. Conclusions There is a lack of agreement in body temperatures values between \{TMT\} and \{OT\} in community-dwelling elderly in both winter and summer. \{OT\} was more stable than \{TMT\} regardless of ambient temperature influences. Therefore, the oral cavity is preferable to the \{TM\} site for temperature measurement in alert elderly. The limitation of this study is that hospitalized patients who are most likely to need temperature measurement are not included in this study. "

We investigated both humoral and cellular immune responses against the pandemic \{H1N1\} 2009 virus before and after immunization with inactivated \{H1N1\} 2009 vaccine. Methods We obtained paired blood specimens from a cohort of participants from nursing homes (n = 108) and a public hospital (n = 60) in Singapore. Serum samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against \{H1N1\} 2009 using microneutralization assays, while peripheral blood mononuclear cells were subjected to interferon-? enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays for whole virus-specific T-cell responses. Results We observed significant increases in geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies after \{H1N1\} 2009 vaccination (from 23.6 pre-vaccination to 94.7 post-vaccination). Approximately 77% and 54% of the cohort exhibited =2-fold and =4-fold increases in neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination; 89.9% of the cohort had a post-vaccination antibody titer of =32. Adjusted for gender, participants aged =60 years were less likely to have a =4-fold increase in antibody titers after vaccination than those aged &lt;60 years (0.48; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.32–0.71, p = 0.007). There was a 1.4-fold elevation in \{H1N1\} 2009-specific T-cell responses after vaccination (p &lt; 0.05). Adjusted for gender, age =60 years was positively associated with a greater increase in T-cell response (ß = 4.9, 95% \{CI\} 1.58–8.29, p = 0.018). No significant correlation was observed between humoral and cellular immune responses. Conclusions Influenza vaccination elicits significant neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses to pandemic \{H1N1\} 2009 influenza virus. However, in response to vaccination, increases in neutralizing antibody titers were comparatively lower but T-cell responses were higher in older participants. Therefore, our study suggests that memory T-cells may play a crucial role in protecting older individuals against pandemic \{H1N1\} 2009 infection. "

Method This article reviews literature on current myths and reality of aging in the context of designing health promotion programs for older adults. Strategies for combating ageist stereotypes are based on a multilevel view of determinants of health and aging. Conclusions Ageist stereotypes are pervasive in U.S. society and harmful to older adults' psychological well-being, physical and cognitive functioning, and survival. Concrete strategies for communicating with older adults can increase the effectiveness of health promotion programs. Strategies for combating ageism and creating a healthier society must address all segments of society, and include educational and media campaigns, an expansion of current research foci, greater sensitivity from care providers, more opportunities for intergenerational linkages, the design of productive roles for older adults, a retrofit of the built environment, and intensified and collaborative action from both the public and private sectors.

In replying to these concerns, we describe the methods used to carry out time-series studies and discuss whether it is reasonable to believe that stress can confound the association. Our analysis suggests that these factors are unlikely to cause bias in time-series studies, although it may be important in panel and other longitudinal studies. Specifically, we argue that: (1) persons most likely to be susceptible to the effects of air pollution, notably the very young and the elderly, and those suffering from certain chronic diseases (e.g., congestive heart failure), are unlikely to be highly exposed to traffic and therefore to traffic-related stress and (2) over lengthy periods of time and sub-populations, levels of individual stress are unlikely to act coherently to create an association with ambient air pollution.

With the world's geriatric population growing sharply, and advances in medical technology announced almost weekly, the time is ripe for the application of technology stewardship to patients of all ages, rather than arbitrary allocation limits for older persons. In life and in death, health care costs are expensive, and while society often views older people as too expensive to take care of alive, their death can be even more costly. For patients of all ages, death under the influence of technology is more expensive than life, yet it is geriatric intensive care medicine that grabs society's economic attention. While possibly not the financial bargain that arbitrary allocation limits have been proposed to be, technology stewardship fosters beneficence and autonomy as human values instead of mere variables subservient to economics.
