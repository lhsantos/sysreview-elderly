 abstract = {Recent advances in telecommunications and information technologies have enabled various novel applications in health care and monitoring to address the needs of elderly and chronic patients. As wireless technology becomes more ubiquitous and affordable, applications, such as video-telephony over POTS, will gradually migrate towards third-generation wireless systems. We can also expect to see low-cost miniature wireless circuitry merging with sensor technologies to create a wide range of minimally invasive continuous health-monitoring systems. In some cases, wireless signals alone can be interpreted to monitor vital signs. These techniques promise to greatly improve the cost and convenience associated with long-term outpatient monitoring, and could potentially extend monitoring to the broader healthy population for preventative diagnostics and alerts.},

 abstract = {The Pervasive Computing Laboratory at the University of Florida is dedicated to creating smart environments and assistants to enable elderly persons to live a longer and a more independent life at home. By achieving this goal, technology will increase the chances of successful aging despite an ailing health care system (e.g. Medicaid). One of the essential services required to maximize the intelligence of a smart environment is an indoor precision tracking system. Such system allows the smart home to make proactive decisions to better serve its occupants by enabling context-awareness instead of being solely reactive to their commands. This paper presents our hands-on experience and lessons learnt from our first phase work to build up a smart home infrastructure for the elderly. We review location tracking technology and describe the rationale behind our choice of the emerging ultrasonic sensor technology. We give an overview of the House of Matilda (an in-laboratory mock up house) and describe our design of a precision in-door tracking system. We also describe an OSGi-based robust framework that abstracts the ultrasonic technology into a standard service to enable the creation of tracking based applications by third party, and to facilitate the collaboration among various devices and other OSGi services. Finally, we describe three pervasive computing applications that use the location-tracking system which we have implemented in Matilda's house.},

 abstract = {Ubicomp researchers have long argued that privacy is a design issue, and it goes without saying that successful design requires that we understand the desires, concerns, and awareness of the technology's users. Yet, because ubicomp systems are relatively unusual, too little empirical research exists to inform designers about potential users. Complicating design further is the fact that ubicomp systems are typically embedded or invisible, making it difficult for users to know when invisible devices are present and functioning. As early as 1993, ubicomp researchers recognized that embedded technology's unobtrusiveness both belies and contributes to its potential for supporting potentially invasive applications. Not surprisingly, users' inability to see a technology makes it difficult for them to understand how it might affect their privacy. Unobtrusiveness, nevertheless, is a reasonable goal because such systems must minimize the demands on users. To investigate these issues further, I conducted an ethnographic study of what I believe is the first US eldercare facility to use a sensor-rich environment. Our subjects were normal civilians (rather than ubicomp researchers) who lived or worked in a ubiquitous computing environment. We interviewed residents, their family members, and the facility's caregivers and managers. Our questions focused on how people understood both the ubiquitous technology and its effect on their privacy. Although the embedded technology played a central role in how people viewed the environment, they had a limited understanding of the technology, thus raising several privacy, design, and safety issues.},

 abstract = {New sensor technologies, powerful mobile devices, and wireless communication standards strongly proliferate ubiquitous and pervasive computing. This is particularly true for healthcare applications. Modern non-invasive unobtrusive sensors enable sophisticated monitoring of the human body. As a result of this monitoring a growing amount of elderly people suffering from chronic diseases will benefit from an enhanced quality of life and improved treatment. Healthcare applications process a vast amount of continuously generated data, this has become a serious challenge. Data stream management addresses this problem in general. However, healthcare applications have additional requirements, e.g., flexibility and reliability. As a consequence, we propose the combination of a sophisticated information infrastructure, called hyperdatabase, and data stream management. Hyperdatabases already allow for reliable process management in a peer-to-peer fashion. In this paper, we elaborate the close relation between distributed process management and data stream management. Further, we show that data stream processing can significantly benefit from an infrastructure for reliable process management. We present the architecture of our prototype infrastructure that supports processing of continuous data streams with a high degree of flexibility and reliability.},

 abstract = {Technology advances and the continuing convergence of computing and telecommunications have made an unprecedented amount of information available to the public. For many people with disabilities, however, accessibility issues limit the impact of such widespread availability. Of the many types of disabilities-mobility, hearing, and learning impairments, for example-vision impairments are most pervasive in the general population, especially among seniors. The world's rapidly aging population is redefining visually impaired, which refers to individuals with low vision (that is, people for whom ordinary eyeglasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lens implants don't provide clear vision), color blindness, and blindness. In 1998, the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act, strengthening provisions covering access to government-posted information for people with disabilities. As amended, Section 508 requires federal agencies to ensure that all assets and technologies are accessible and usable by employees and the public, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Most current assistive technologies for visually impaired users are expensive, difficult to use, and platform dependent. A new approach by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), addresses these weaknesses by locating the assistive capability at the server, thus freeing visually impaired individuals from the software expense, technical complexity, and substantial learning curve of other assistive technologies. NLM's Senior Health Web site (http://nihseniorhealth.gov), a talking Web (a Web application that presents Web content as speech to users), demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.},

With the advent of new drugs and therapies to delay the onset of dementia, it is important to both detect signs as early as possible and to provide monitoring of cognitive changes. This paper describes unobtrusive methods for monitoring user interactions with a computer that serve as a basis for algorithms to measure cognitive performance. We adapted a standard computer game currently enjoyed by elders at risk for dementia in order to monitor natural performance on a task that involved significant strategic planning throughout the game. This enabled us to collect cognitive performance data on individuals at frequent intervals. We monitored move-by-move appropriateness as distance to solution, and additionally modeled user thought processes using between-move data from the mouse device. We then used our resulting dynamic user model both to adapt the game difficulty and to detect meaningful individual cognitive trends.},

 abstract = {The paper presents an ultrasonic sensor network system that can be utilized in elderly care homes. One of the problems of an aging society is the shortage of carers in homes for the aged; the shortage imposes an increasing workload on carers and leads to a deterioration of the quality of care for the elderly. The authors developed an ultrasonic sensor network system to reduce the workload on carers. The system monitors the elderly people in a nursing room continuously and remotely, and, when it detects accident-prone events or accidents of the elderly, it notifies carers about the occurrence of such events. The system was installed in a nursing home in Tokyo and has been running for several months. The paper describes the background of the research, the system overview, and results obtained during its real operation.},

Japan's industrial giants have developed robots that monitor hospital patients, warn against intruders, and serve as companions for the elderly. Following the ancient Chinese phrase, "crisis equals opportunity," they're predicting that rising health care costs, labor shortages, and the aging population will create an enormous market for robots. Korea is also well-situated for growth in the robotics market. Perhaps in an attempt to leapfrog Japan, it has developed a wireless robot platform that brings thin-client concepts to the world of robots. The US, looking to capitalize on the growing use of sensor networks, hopes to use robots to monitor a wide range of sensors. Projects in all three countries include plans to deploy robots as "companions" that unobtrusively perform a range of services.},

To this end, it places the point-of-care in the community and often at the patients' own home. In this paper we discuss the building blocks of pervasive self care, a ubiquitous computing service infrastructure that can play a critical role in supporting patients with long tern conditions to manage their case. This service employs computing elements embedded in the home environment and the body so as to provide context-aware case management. The proposed architecture brings together islands of pervasive computing functionality into an integrated end-to-end architecture. In doing so, it aims to introduce a generic reference model for the delivery of pervasive self-care services that can help limit the considerable amount of duplication in current work in this field},

Family members or volunteer workers can identify the real-time positions of missing elderly using mobile phone, PDA, Notebook PC, and various mobile devices through the service platform. System performance and reliability is analyzed. Experiments performed on four different time slots, from three locations, through three mobile telecommunication companies show that the overall transaction time is 34 s and the average deviation of the geographical location is about 8 m.

Students also report drinking more and longer at Foxfield than during Halloween and football games (events known to be large social events at UVA). 66% of respondents also reported at least one negative consequence as a result of another's drinking and 68% reported at least one negative consequence as a result of his own drinking. This work helps to lay the groundwork for a large sample data collection after the 2006 running of the Foxfield Races on April 29th},

Guidance is performed by division of environment to accessible and inaccessible areas and the motion of walker-user system is constrained inside the accessible area called potential canal. This paper attempts at providing evidence to the fact that loose guide method is an approach to optimal guidance in the sense that when the control (constrain) of ORTW-II motion is loose, its motion pattern significantly resembles user's unconstrained motion. Healthy user's natural motion is hypothesized to be optimal and is compared with constrained motion pattern of ORTW-II for different settings of the potential canal. Experimental results are provided and discussed},

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a gentle system for watching over for ubiquitous care-support services that fulfill users' actual requirements. In traditional systems of this domain, only the location information of a user on "one" side of the watching site or the watched site is considered. In this work, we cope not only with the user's location but also all the detailed situations (contexts) of associated entities such as devices, software, networks, and users, in "both" sides. To do this, we propose a ubiquitous watching over system "uEyes". In uEyes, autonomous decision making ability and cooperative behavior are introduced to each entity. Based on the advanced feature of the entities, live video streaming system is dynamically constructed according to the contexts of the entities, on both sides in runtime. As a result, watching over service that fulfills detailed users' requirements can be effectively provided. We implemented a prototype of uEyes for watching over elderly people, and performed some experiments based on several scenarios. For instance, we assumed a scenario that a son, who is taking care of his ailing father, wanted to see his facial color and expression in high quality video. We confirmed that the live video streaming system involving high resolution camera and display devices is dynamically configured in run-time},

The system provides a complete, end-to-end and scalable solution for a wide range of applications ranging from remote healthcare monitoring of elderly people living alone to health management for all the residents in an aged-care facility under a limited number of staff. The major benefits of such a system include its pervasive and unobtrusive nature, an elevated objectivity level and hence quality in health assessment and a significant reduction in service provision cost. The system architecture encompasses the abilities to collect multiple types of data from both static and mobile sensors, transfer such data over either a homogeneous or hybrid wireless network to a central server, and perform data fusion to extract vital information about the health status of the person being monitored},

With the advanced mobile technologies we are now able to develop quality mobile services to help senior citizens' daily lives in dedicated smart living environments. This paper presents a systematic approach to design and develop mobile services which meet the needs of senior citizens. The quality function deployment (QFD) approach was first adopted to translate quality requirements for mobile services to technical (design) requirements for design purpose. Two most important design requirements were identified in the QFD process and they are the need for emergency service and the need for good tele healthcare provider. An architecture is then proposed to incorporate the two most important design requirements. The concept of wireless information device (WID) is integrated into the architecture to enhance service mobility, personalization and security. The pros and cons of the QFD approach as well as the architecture were discussed and future work is outlined at the end of the paper. This paper contributes to the design and development of high quality mobile services for senior citizens in smart living environments.},

Visual information consists of body orientation calculated from posture extraction and of periods of inactivity. The context model allows for a different interpretation of the visual fall detection results, depending on the exact location, time and duration of the detected event. The context model is learnt during the ongoing monitoring task without human intervention and automatically adapts to the changing activity patterns of the monitored subject},

While the former enables health organisations to interchange information and provide patients information about health care, the latter directly supports patients in managing their everyday life. Discussing issues about spatial health applications from the computational point of view a problem is identified. Being grounded on measurements of the spatiotemporal change of objects and especially of people, i.e. their locomotion, spatial health applications are in need of formalisms which are capable of dealing with imprecise spatial information. A computational framework shows how imprecise spatial information can be dealt with so that the locomotion problem gets tractable. Moreover, this framework aids in analysing and designing spatial health applications},

Although the measurements are not taken in a controlled setting, there are distinct advantages to being able to collect data frequently in a naturalistic setting. Routine measurements over time allow us to detect trends in various aspects of cognitive performance and avoid biases due to education, culture, and experience.},

 abstract = {Taiwan started to be an 'aging society' from 1993, and the aging process will progress more rapidly due to markedly decreased child birth in recent year. Facing very high old age dependency ratio as 1 to 2 in year 2030 which means every two working age persons (age 15 - 64 years) have to support one elderly people. That would be an enormous burden for every family and society. In this study a U-Care system was developed and implemented in a satellite city region of Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan, to provide a comprehensive living and health care service network for the elderly. The u-Health research team of National Taiwan University and Hospital collaborate with Cardinal Tien Hospital Young-Ho Branch, 17 primary care doctors and two living care service provider partners to provide integrated and continuous services for elderly people in home, community and institutional setting.},

 abstract = {The emerging of wireless sensor network has profound impacts on many fields, among which medical application is important one. Wireless biomedical sensor network can provide long-term, real-time and non-obstructive medical supervision for the patients. The large scale application of wireless medical sensor network can effectively reduce higher cost burden owing to the aging society and long term healthcare for the chronic ill. It can also enhance the quality of life for elderly people and chronic patients, and decrease the probability of medical errors. This paper presents a pervasive medical supervision system based on the wireless sensor network on the acceptable cost and application feasibility. Except for bio-information such as the oximetry, the heart rate/pulse and the blood pressure, our system also provides some associated context data, e.g., the environment temperature, and the patient's video/picture in emergency situation which distinguishes our research with other similar systems. The design and implementation of the system composition are discussed in this paper. We also preliminary explore the network schedule mechanism of compound data transmission in this system.},

 abstract = {Ubiquitous is a Latin-derived word meaning "to exist at any time and place" likes water or air. In computing, the word "ubiquitous" indicates an environment in which users have access to networks without any limitation regarding computers, networks or places. Important issues in building Ubiquitous Korea (U-Korea) are the social problems appearing with a rapid increase in the old age population. Nowadays, with the rise of the nuclear family, the increase in the number of elderly people living alone, and the change in the status of women, both wives and husbands are employed outside the home, and the relatives who would be responsible for supporting the elderly sometimes are on long or short business trips, and it happens that old people can't be looked after. Therefore the government developed a wireless paging system for the sick , disabled, old and weak so that when an emergency happens, by just simply dialing 119, an emergency aid center could take prompt action. However, the present wireless paging systems composing the under-layer of the emergency aid information system have some problems, such as, a lack of reliability, problems among terminals, mobile transmitters and receiving terminals, the users' refusal to admit the need for the system and poor operational skills, administrators' perfunctory management and checks, etc. On account of these problems, the system efficiency has degraded and therefore a system upgrade is necessary. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the newly implemented SAFE119 system, a new wireless paging system seeking to correct the problems of the current system.},

 abstract = {Mild sclerotic thickening of the aortic valve affects 25% of the population, and the condition causes aortic valve stenosis (AS) in 2% of adults above 65 years. Echocardiography is today the clinical standard for assessing AS. However, a cost effective and uncomplicated technique that can be used for decision support in the primary health care would be of great value. In this study, recorded phonocardiographic signals were analyzed using the first local minimum of the auto mutual information (AMI) function. The AMI method measures the complexity in the sound signal, which is related to the amount of turbulence in the blood flow and thus to the severity of the stenosis. Two previously developed phonocardiographic methods for assessing AS severity were used for comparison, the murmur energy ratio and the sound spectral averaging technique. Twenty-nine patients with suspected AS were examined with Doppler echocardiography. The aortic jet velocity was used as a reference of AS severity, and it was found to correlate with the AMI method, the murmur energy ratio and the sound spectral averaging technique with the correlation coefficient R = 0.82, R = 0.73 and R = 0.76, respectively.},

 abstract = {Advances in Information and Communication Technologies, ICT, are bringing new opportunities and use cases in the field of systems and Personal Health Devices used for the telemonitoring of citizens in Home or Mobile scenarios. At a time of such challenges, this review arises from the need to identify robust technical telemonitoring solutions that are both open and interoperable. These systems demand standardized solutions to be cost effective and to take advantage of standardized operation and interoperability. Thus, the fundamental challenge is to design plug-&-play devices that, either as individual elements or as components, can be incorporated in a simple way into different Telecare systems, perhaps configuring a personal user network. Moreover, there is an increasing market pressure from companies not traditionally involved in medical markets, asking for a standard for Personal Health Devices, which foresee a vast demand for telemonitoring, wellness, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and e- health applications. However, the newly emerging situations imply very strict requirements for the protocols involved in the communication. The ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards is adapting and moving in order to face the challenge and might appear the best positioned international standards to reach this goal. This work presents an updated survey of these standards, trying to track the changes that are being fulfilled, and tries to serve as a starting-point for those who want to familiarize themselves with them.},

Two levels of difficulty were used in the training, conducted in five sessions over the course of one week. Subjects felt very immersed in the environment and game performance increased gradually. Lateral head movements were recorded consistently throughout the training period and between difficulty levels, with a range of 60Â° left and right. Performance on standard balance tests after training also showed improvement. This suggests that this readily available virtual reality game could be used in balance rehabilitation.},

A few sub-systems have been amalgamated to achieve the desired objective. The integrated system is able to support people who wish to live alone but, because of old age, ill health or disability, are at risk and are a cause of concern for their family and friends. The first part of the integrated system, named Selective Activity Monitoring (SAM) system, works on the principle of using sensor units (SU) to monitor various electrical appliances in a house. Rules, based on the daily activities of a person, are defined for the appliances to be monitored. The system can detect violation of the rules and generate an alarm. The rules are flexible and can be user-defined. The second part of the system is a low-cost Physiological Parameters Monitoring (PPM) system, called Medicmate, which can be used to monitor physiological parameters of a human subject such as body temperature, blood oxygen level and heart rate. It can also detect a fall. The third part of the system is a Web-enabled, robot-based vision system. The robot, operating in a home environment, can be remote controlled by a computer over the Internet. The camera, mounted on the robot, can be used to send a picture of the affected area.},

Firstly sensor node can detect abnormality in ECG then transfer abnormal ECG data in the network to server for further analysis. This system can be used to reduce data packet overload and to save power consumption in wireless sensor network. It can also increase the server performance by reducing load. The ECG features are used to detect life-threatening arrhythmias with an emphasis of analyzing QRS complex in ECG signals at a sensor node. Based on abnormal ECG activity due to R-R interval and QRS width, the sensor node can transfer ECG data to the server for extended and cautious ECG analysis and disease classification.

In this paper, we propose a framework which supports efficient context-aware data fusion for healthcare applications that assume contexts could be ambiguous. Our framework provides a systematic approach to derive context fragments, and deal with context ambiguity in a probabilistic manner. We also incorporate the ability to represent contexts within the applications, and the ability to easily compose rules to mediate ambiguous contexts. Through simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for monitoring elderly people in the smart home environment.},

 abstract = {The changes of medical environments such as the growth of a patient with a chronic disease and the elderly, and the advance of the IT technology require highly qualified medical service of new paradigm. For the reason, home health management service has been focused with much expectations and interests. Our proposed home health management system (H2MS) monitors and manages daily physiological status which is easily acquired from multiple-sensor based ubiquitous bio-signal sensor during sleeping, bathing, evacuating, and living at home. H2MS is largely consisted of four functional subsystems: multiple-sensor based ubiquitous bio-signal sensor, home health intermediary client (H2IC), home health center (H2C), and home health service provider (H2SP). Each subsystem carried out their own processes and collaborated on a work with each other. H2MS provides various home health services for the wellness, as well as the elderly, chronic patient's illness, or terminal illness. Also, it is available to suggest various services: an early warning service according to the change of health status, advice service for health improvement, and appointment service for medical treatment. Moreover, this early warning service makes promptly emergency repairs as soon as occurrence of physiologically abnormal symptom. Consequently, early warning reports reduce the frequent intervention of high costed service of medical professionals.},

We use service oriented architecture (SOA) to orchestrate the available resources inside the community, thus bringing social intelligence to the social computing. We also propose building such a virtual community making use of virtual reality and in the form of serious game [Stuart Rory, 1996]. Daily activities and instruments (such as sensors, cameras, etc.) in real-life may be translated into their virtual community equivalents, and activities happening in the virtual world will trigger corresponding actions in the real world, so that inter-reality may be obtained through this virtual community. We expect such a virtual community could help not only efficiently utilizing the social resources in maintaining the independent living of the elderly people, but also helping these people maintain their connections to the society and bring them entertainment, so that the quality of their living standard may be improved at the same time.},

We begin by observing the effects of some less studied factors, such as height of devices and impact of human contact on the antenna. We then present results on the characterization of two environments, namely residential housing and the university campus.

 abstract = {Summary form only given. Health services are today facing a number of interacting challenges. It is generally accepted that major, even radical, changes are required in health services to deliver better health outcomes at an affordable cost. IT is a change driver both in the horizontal and vertical directions. Horizontally we see the emergence and extension of a generic IT infrastructure that eventually will allow anytime, anywhere access to information and knowledge and context aware decision making. In the vertical direction IT enables a more effective and efficient health service environment. Standards and guidelines for an interoperable electronic patient record (EPR) have been developed and are today endorsed by industry and governments. Several countries are investing into a nation-wide "backbone" for health information and EPR exchange. The creation of the "backbone" allows separating data from processes. It's the processes (services) where the biggest potential and challenge is for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of health services. Another change driver is the expansion of (traditional) healthcare into a "health continuum" with the aim to engage and empower people to proactively manage their health and illness. This extends to the ageing people that can be assisted with tools and services to remain independent and integrated with the society. A third driver is the integration of medicine, life sciences, and engineering and physical sciences. These drivers point towards an application landscape that is characterized by "3 P's": pervasive, personal and personalized. In the keynote, we define what these three P's contain and how they relate to each other.},

 abstract = {Recent years have shown impressive growth in the development of pervasive healthcare systems, which are primarily being designed to provide emergency and preventive healthcare to citizens anywhere/anytime using wired and wireless mobile technologies. This paper presents an e-healthcare framework with pervasive sensor network for the disabled and elderly people. A home healthcare server collects user health information and sends the data in case of emergency to a doctor or guardian in order to achieve a pervasive intelligent healthcare system. Beyond e-healthcare service, as a primitive application for pervasive healthcare service using mobile Internet, we studied the real-time health-monitoring service for the disabled and elderly people with an inexpensive and effective Web server. Preliminary results are presented in the context of a larger future integration with the pervasive healthcare framework.},

 abstract = {A major practical problem when implementing home monitoring using 3D camera technology is the calibration process which serves to relate the camera coordinate system to a coordinate system interpretable by the caregiver. In this paper, we propose a calibration algorithm which can relate both coordinate systems without performing actual measurements of the position of reference points in the room. The calibration tool is constructed such that it can be operated by any caregiver and hence eases the deployment of the home monitoring appliances. Our method (semi)automatically detects a plane corresponding to the ground floor in the three dimensional images. Random points from that plane are used to calculate rotation angles in a least squares manner. Experiments are performed to investigate how the obtained results depend on the parameters of the algorithm.},

The aims of the present paper are to investigate, verify and evaluate the elderly heart patients' (EHP) compliance, trust and comfort in relation to a real-time wireless telemedicine system at home. A telemedicine system composed of a patient-unit, a GSM/GPRS network, a router, a data interpreter and a monitoring system was used. Twenty four non risky EHPs, aged (60plusmn5) years were recruited. A week of continuous ECGs for each of the EHPs were recorded. The experiments were carried out while the EHPs were performing their every day's activities. The EHPs' compliance, trust and comfort was verified and evaluated by three questionnaires. In average, 52% of the EHPs scored the user-friendly and usability of the system as reasonable. Only 16% sought help from the healthcare personnel in respect with the application of the patient-unit. 76% scored the reliability of the system as "reasonable" and 20% as "only now and then". It is concluded that the present system is reliable, functions with a clinically acceptable performance. The EHPs have expressed reasonable compliance and trust to the application of the system at home; however a number of the elderly were not satisfied with the weight and the user-interface of the ECG device.},

The system aims to ensure the efficiency of the elderly care system. Ageing of the population structure in Finland generates an eminent need for more resources in this field. The main pilot sites of the described system are in the senior homes, where the personnel will be most stressed in the near future. The location data can be used for various purposes such as making alarms of senior persons getting up from bed during the night risking them selves of losing balance. Making an alarm during falling down on the floor has an obvious benefit for the habitants of old age homes.},

The collaboration among them can supply more information to help making correct decision and taking action timely. However, it is a challenge to achieving an effective collaborative healthcare among multiple parities with individual knowledge, located in different places, operating in different time, and doing not know each other even. For addressing the challenges in collaborative healthcare, this paper proposes an ontology-based semantic collaborative healthcare approach to supporting and enhancing the living of the elderly people. This approach achieves the semantic collaboration by exploiting the knowledge about the elderly, healthcare related information tuple, and the users including professional, relatives and so on. Ontology is utilized to model and represent such kinds of knowledge. A tuplespace-based coordination model is adopted to support the cooperation among different parities at anytime and anywhere with anybody. We built a prototype system, and evaluated its effectiveness with preliminary experiments.},

Whilst traditionally, circuit-based models for lead-acid batteries centre on the well-known Randles' model, here the Randles' model is mapped to an equivalent circuit, demonstrating improved modelling capabilities and more accurate estimates of circuit parameters when used in Subspace parameter estimation techniques. Combined with Kalman Estimator algorithms, these techniques are demonstrated to correctly identify and converge on voltages associated with the battery State-of-Charge, overcoming problems such as SoC drift (incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over-charging or ambient temperature fluctuations). Online monitoring of the degradation of these estimated parameters allows battery ageing (State-of-Health) to be assessed and, in safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Due to the adaptive nature of the proposed methodology, this system can be implemented over a wide range of operating environments, applications and battery topologies.},

In pervasive healthcare settings, protecting the privacy of the medical care subjects and the medical staff is very important, because the lack of privacy may hinder the broad acceptance of pervasive health technology. Moreover, there is a need of empowering end-users with flexible personalized controls for their personal data collected, processed and communicated via SNs. The privacy protecting mechanisms must be non-obtrusive and context-aware to support the daily private and professional life of the persons. Since the devices/nodes used by patients and medical professionals will have diverse capabilities, many of them with very limited resources, an important question is the implication of the privacy protection mechanisms on the overall system performance. This paper proposes novel flexible privacy protection framework suitable for diverse set of ubiquitous applications; describes evaluation frames for it and investigates the cost of privacy protection.

 abstract = {If we watch elderly people at home for health or security purposes, we need a reliable pervasive information from a domestic network of localizing sensors allowing to follow the different locations at which the dependent persons can be detected. The data recorded can be treated as the sequence of color coded numbers of balls (symbolizing rooms) taken in a Polya's urn, in which the persistence of the presence in a room is taken into account by adding a certain number of balls of the same color as the ball just drawn. We discuss the pertinency of such a procedure to early detect sudden or chronic changes in the parameters values of the random process made of the succession of ball numbers and we use it to trigger alarms, whose level depends on the real biological age of the elderly people watched at home.},

 abstract = {One major challenge to successful aging is the capability to preserve health, or from another perspective to avoid disease. Unfortunately, a large percentage of the elderly people are living with chronic diseases or disabilities. Home care technologies and other emerging technologies have the potential to play a major role in home-based health care approach. The main goal of the presented research in this paper is to develop a cost-effective user-friendly telemedicine system to serve the elderly and disabled people in the community, and to establish a continuous communication link between patients and caregivers and allow physicians to offer help when needed. Hence, we are presenting here an integrated user-friendly model of a smart home which provides telemedicine for elderly at home. The paper focuses on implementation details and practical considerations of integrating the diverse technologies into a working system.},

 abstract = {Elder people are becoming a predominant aspect of our societies. As such, solutions both efficacious and cost-effective need to be sought. Our previous study suggests that mutual assisted living community, where dwellers make contributions to the community. Thus community resources could be fully utilized and requested services would be provided in a prompt way. We used service oriented architecture (SOA) to orchestrate the available resources inside the community; and we organize the services into different forms such as formal ones (carried out by professionals, etc), informal ones (assisted by relatives, volunteers, .etc) and even as group activities. We expect such a community could help not only efficiently utilizing the social resources in maintaining the independent living of the elderly people, but also helping these people maintain their connections to the society and bring them entertainment, so that the quality of their living standard may be improved at the same time. This paper continues the track of the previous studies on building mutual assistance communities. Service matching algorithms are developed providing flexible choices on both requested services content and the organization forms of the services.},

The elderly nursing home plays an important role and intends to provide a comfortable environment and living space and serve as safe and healthy place for the elderly. However, the frailty and fragility of the elderly in both physiologically and psychologically make it an uneasy task. To enhance the service and care quality of an elderly nursing home, a ubiquitous monitor system integrated with biosensors and wireless network technology was implemented as a prototyping system. For managing sensors easily, the universal plug and play (UPnP) technology from digital living network alliance (DLNA) is adopted. The system was expected to be a digital health network to improve the activity of daily living (ADL) of the residents, to detect the emergencies or accidents such as stroke, falling down, fainting, and heart attack, in order to enhance the quality of care and promote efficiency at the same time.},

Our recent work in detection of tripping gait patterns has demonstrated that minimum toe clearance (MTC) is a sensitive falls risk predictor. MTC measurement has previously been done in gait laboratories and on treadmills which potentially imposes controlled walking conditions. In this paper, we describe a prototype design of a wireless device for monitoring vertical toe clearance. The sensors consists of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope connected to Crossbow sensor motes for wireless data transmission. Sensor data are transmitted to a laptop and displayed on a Matlab graphic user interface (GUI). We have performed zero base and treadmill experiments to investigate sensor performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20m indoors and 50m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements were found to follow the Optotrak measurement trend but could be improved further by dealing with double integration errors and improving data transmission rates.},

As people become older though, independent living can present more of a challenge. Thus, the provision of in-home services will assist aged people in carrying out their daily tasks. In this paper, the personalized framework of the INHOME project is presented, which aims to provide the means for improving the quality of life of elderly people at home, by developing generic technologies for managing their domestic ambient environment.},

For supporting the independent living and prompting the quality of life of the elderly, assistant technology has been identified as a promising approach to address these challenges, which is able to provide necessary help to elders in appropriate time. This paper investigates the unobtrusive assistant technique. We propose a behavior model to describe the activities of the forgetful elderly. Based on this model, we develop an unobtrusive assistant, which provides reminders according to eldersÂ¿ practical needs, and avoids unnecessary notifications that will disrupt the eldersÂ¿ life. The preliminary experiments evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.},

 abstract = {Tripping and slipping falls are serious health concerns for the elderly because they incur high medical costs and can result in life threatening injuries i.e., internal bleeding. Recently there has been an increased interest in the development of portable inertial sensing devices for measuring human movement. These devices employ acceleration and angular data to obtain limb motion such as velocity and displacement through integration of acceleration values. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a wireless inertial sensing device for monitoring vertical toe clearance during walking. It has been demonstrated that variability in minimum toe clearance (MTC) which occurs during the swing phase is a sensitive falls risk predictor. Our device is composed of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope wirelessly connected through the use of Crossbow motes. The vertical toe clearance is obtained through double integration of the resultant acceleration in the vertical direction. We have performed zero base, treadmill and intersubject experiments to investigate device performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20 m indoors and 50 m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements coincided with Optotrak measurement trends but suffered from cumulative integration errors over time. The identification, quantification and reduction of these errors are intricate but important further research issues.},

The paper proposes an ultra-wearable smart sensor system combines electrocardiogram (ear-lead ECG), tri-axial accelerometer, and GPS sensors to measure normal or elderly personpsilas daily activities. The ear-lead makes possible to measure ECG signals without any chest belt or sticky tape. It measures the ECG signals from an ear to an arm. According to our research, the ear-lead is linear combination with regular ECG lead I and III. For most of people, especially, the ear-lead is highly correlated with lead-I ECG. Lead I can be used to detect some life-threatening ECG signals with critical heart rate or morphology changes such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular flutter (VFL), or ventricular fibrillation (VFib). The hardware of smart sensor integrates a TI MSP430 microprocessor, Bluetooth wireless transmission to PC client software, micro SD card storage, and LCD display. The embedded algorithm combines two sensors for noise reduction and utilizes voice biofeedback for exercise overload warning.},

The course evaluation was based on a game project. The class selected a simulation of impaired driving, and called it the Booze Cruise. Before embarking on the simulation, we consulted with the Calgary Police Service. Its alcohol unit was keen to help and gave a summary of the what and why of accident types related to alcohol consumption. Impaired driving is a serious problem and a preventable cause of death and injury. Private and public health organizations are always seeking better ways to reach the public with the message that drinking and driving is dangerous and socially irresponsible. When we announced the game in October 2007, the media response was huge (see Figure 1). The game also won the best student game and people's choice categories in the FuturePlay 2007 Conference's games competition that year (www. futureplay.org). In this article, we summarize the game's design process and development stages. We also look at media responses, which are still active.},

 abstract = {The ever growing percentage of elderly people within modern societies poses welfare systems under relevant stress. In fact, partial and progressive loss of motor, sensorial, and/or cognitive skills renders elders unable to live autonomously, eventually leading to their hospitalization. This results in both relevant emotional and economic costs. Ubiquitous computing technologies can offer interesting opportunities for in-house safety and autonomy. However, existing systems partially address in-house safety requirements and typically focus on only elder monitoring and emergency detection. The paper presents ANGELAH, a middleware-level solution integrating both "elder monitoring and emergency detection" solutions and networking solutions. ANGELAH has two main features: i) it enables efficient integration between a variety of sensors and actuators deployed at home for emergency detection and ii) provides a solid framework for creating and managing rescue teams composed of individuals willing to promptly assist elders in case of emergency situations. A prototype of ANGELAH, designed for a case study for helping elders with vision impairments, is developed and interesting results are obtained from both computer simulations and a real-network testbed.},

 abstract = {The growing aging population faces a number of challenges, including rising medical cost, inadequate number of medical doctors and healthcare professionals, as well as higher incidence of misdiagnosis. There is an increasing demand for a better healthcare support for the elderly and one promising solution is the development of a context-aware middleware infrastructure for pervasive health/wellness-care. This allows the accurate and timely delivery of health/medical information among the patients, doctors and healthcare workers through a widespread deployment of wireless sensor networks and mobile devices. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of such a context-aware middleware for pervasive homecare (CAMPH). The middleware offers several key-enabling system services that consist of P2P-based context query processing, context reasoning for activity recognition and context-aware service management. It can be used to support the development and deployment of various homecare services for the elderly such as patient monitoring, location-based emergency response, anomalous daily activity detection, pervasive access to medical data and social networking. We have developed a prototype of the middleware and demonstrated the concept of providing a continuing-care to an elderly with the collaborative interactions spanning multiple physical spaces: person, home, office and clinic. The results of the prototype show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context query processing and good accuracy of activity recognition.},

These environments constitute a distributed, heterogeneous, highly dynamic infrastructure that makes it necessary to build AAL applications as adaptive software including the necessary mechanisms to dynamically modify their behavior. In this paper we propose a multi-level model to build context-aware self-adaptive entities: the basic level defines the mandatory functionalities for adaptive entities, while upper-levels define how to coordinate adaptation of primitive or composite entities.

Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a new approach which promises to address the needs from elderly people. Ambient intelligence technologies are widely developed in this domain aiming to construct safe environments around assisted peoples and help them maintain independent living. However, there are still many fundamental issues in AAL that remain open. Most of the current efforts still do not fully express the power of human being, and the importance of social connections and social activities is less noticed. Our conjecture is that such features are fundamental prerequisites towards truly effective AAL services. This paper reviews the current status of researches on AAL, discusses the promises and possible advantages of AAL, and also indicates the challenges we must meet in order to develop practical and efficient AAL systems for elderly people. In this paper, we also propose an approach to construct effective home-care system for the elderly people.},

 abstract = {The development of ambient assisted living (AAL) systems, which are tailored to health or elder care, requires specific methods and tools. AAL systems make often use of wireless sensor networks, machine learning algorithms and sensory devices. Since wireless sensor networks and their sensors are inhomogeneous, it became apparent that such systems need to cope with different hardware platforms, different programming languages, unreliable wireless communication, energy constraints, data analysis algorithms, recognition of situations, and deployment options. Developers to date tend to use a bottom-up approach: hardware components dictate the development of AAL systems and thereby restrict the range of use cases that can be realized; domain experts by contrast would prefer a top-down approach and model the systempsilas functionality independently from the hardware platform. Currently available software development environments and tools do not adequately support domain experts and developers to accomplish these tasks efficiently. This paper presents methods that support domain experts in their top-down approach, as well as technically experienced developers in their bottom-up approach. The implemented tools enable a model-driven software development process (from platform-independent modeling to generating AAL application code) and thus facilitate programming AAL systems.},

Based on these premises we present Eldergames, an EU funded project that aims at creating an interactive tool for preserving cognitive functions impaired by aging and affording sociability. A first prototype has recently been created and its acceptance has been tested on groups of elderly users. The prototype proved able to provide a pleasant social cognitive training because of its simplicity, usability of the interface, and multiplayer architecture.},

 abstract = {The AGNES project focuses on improving the mental and physical wellbeing of elderly people living alone at home, who often suffer the effects of social and physical isolation - including cognitive decline, low activity levels and poor mood states. AGNES will carry out novel technological interventions in an area that is emerging as the new frontier in ageing research. The project will use scientifically-based knowledge on ageing and innovative technology to intervene in the lives of target users in specific and carefully selected ways, and the effects of these interventions on cognitive functioning and quality of life will be evaluated, going beyond the existing state of the art. The results will provide significant new knowledge on the potential of new information technologies to delay, help deal with, and even prevent common chronic problems experienced by the elderly population. This paper presents a short description of AGNES as a project in progress.},

 abstract = {This paper is a report of the feasibility and outcome of using a low-cost, commercially available gaming system - Wii Fit - for balance training after stroke. The patient was an 86 year-old woman five weeks after stroke, who was unable to walk without close supervision, even with a walker, due to poor balance and a tendency to fall. In addition to standard physical therapy, the patient participated in four training sessions with the Wii Fit system; each training session included four different games. The outcome measures were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Reach and Lateral Reach tests, Timed Up & Go test (TUG), computerized posturography, and the Short Feedback Questionnaire (SFQ). The tests were done before the intervention and on the last day of training. The SFQ was done during the third training session. The patient greatly enjoyed the training sessions and felt that she was receiving very dasiaup-to-datepsila treatment. She did not experience any discomfort such as nausea or dizziness while using the system. Following combined Wii and standard treatment, the patient demonstrated improved antero-posterior symmetry of stance, and there was a 10 second improvement in her TUG score. When released from hospital, she was able to walk with a walker with minimal supervision. This initial pilot study indicates that the Wii Fit gaming system has the potential to be used in clinical settings in order to improve balance. A full clinical trial is necessary in order to examine this premise.},

Aim of the study is the development of a light technological infrastructure to be integrated in the homes of old people at reduced costs, allowing the detection of critical health situations. In particular a reliable fall detector is presented, with focus on the protection and assistance to the elderly in the home environment. The integrated fall detector prototype includes two different sensors: a 3D Time-of-Flight range camera and a wearable MEMS accelerometer. The devices are connected in a networked configuration with custom interface circuits to a central PC that collects and processes the information with a multi-threading approach. For each sensor, an optimized algorithm for fall-detection has been developed and benchmarked on a collected multimodal database. This work is expected to lead to a multi-sensory approach employing appropriate fusion techniques aiming to improve system efficiency and reliability.},

 abstract = {Our aging society in industrialised countries is not only characterised by higher age and better health in general, but in age related capabilities and handicaps often based on chronic diseases and functional losses. Additionally multimorbidity can lead to functional losses followed by handicaps and disabilities. In consequence the elderly person can suffer from immobility, social isolation and depression. Furthermore it implies a high risk of loosing his or her independence. The main aim for those elderly is to obtain their `every day competence' in spite of lifelong handicap and chronic disease. Cause of new developments in ambient technologies there is a challenge to supplement multi- and interdisciplinary approach to fulfil these aims. Ambient technologies as part of information and communication technologies have a great potential to influence quality of life for elderly people and prolong their independence. We will report about different examples of ambient technologies for this challenge. In `Tele-Reha', a tele-rehabilitation-project, mobility-impaired patients after discharge from hospital, their caregiving relatives, and geriatric professionals were comprised using PC-based videoconferencing systems. Additional they got access to a computer based information service. The objective was to prevent social isolation, more functional disabilities and secondary diseases which may result in the frequent need for outpatient or inpatient treatment. Another project focused on patients after stroke or hip fracture by sensor technology based home rehabilitation. Most of our patients have not reached their full potential of mobility and independence after the hospital. We conduct studies to investigate the feasibility of a sensor based home exercise program for motor learning. The project `nutribook' was developed for patients with severe chronic nutrition deficits who live at home and have ambulant services by nurses and their family doctors.},

 abstract = {Dementia is a progressive and often gradual decline in mental ability that affects thinking, remembering and reasoning. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, there are many other causes of cognitive decline, such as age related memory loss. Technological and medical advancements have pushed life expectancy higher, thus increasing the number of elderly people and consequently the number of patients that need to be hospitalized. This puts financial pressure on medical institutions which, in conjunction with the shortage of geriatric care professionals, has prompted these institutions to seek various cost-cutting strategies. In particular, technological solutions can address these problems through monitoring and assisting patients with cognitive decline and providing support to their caregivers. The aim is to provide a smart environment that lessens the demand for caregivers to manually assess patients' behavior in specific tasks and hence evaluate cognitive decline. Additionally, within these environments it becomes feasible to implement assistive applications that can support dementia patients while performing everyday tasks. In this respect, this paper proposes the fusion of machine vision and an RFID system that can effectively address the above issues. We will also describe two scenarios that correspond to two different activities the patient can perform and provide an insight into the solutions that are used to support patients and their caregivers in these scenarios.},

 abstract = {We conducted five focus groups with seniors and middle-aged participants who live independently in their own homes to assess the potential value of a home-centered medication reminder system concept. The medication reminder system was conceptualized as a system that uses a television and set-top box, mobile phones and other in-home accessories as a means to set and deliver medication reminders. We found that the main value perceived by participants in the medication reminder system was its ability to provide multiple channels for them to be reminded of medications. The mobile phone, due to its advantages in portability and privacy, was considered to be the most useful device on which to receive reminders. Most participants saw value in receiving secondary reminders on other devices in their home such as the TV, PC, and other in-home accessories. Design implications along with other findings about the challenges faced by participants in managing their medications are discussed.},

 abstract = {The use of context-aware technology in the home enables new ways to stimulate elderly in increasing their exercise levels, and consequently prevent age-related health issues amongst an increasing elderly population. This paper describes the design of a persuasive virtual coach that encourages seniors to walk more. In order to incorporate the user values and needs in the design concept, a user panel of elderly people was actively involved in the design process. A range of persuasive principles and interaction metaphors were evaluated with the user panel, resulting in a design concept that was approved and appreciated by the user panel. The design concept combines a pedometer with wireless connectivity with a touch-screen photo frame. As a first step towards a longer evaluation, an experimental prototype was tested in the field with two participants for 11 days each. Whereas the participants of the exploratory intervention did appreciate the virtual coach and they did feel more motivated to exercise, the quantitative figures did not yet show an increase in physical activity in time; a possible explanation could be the limited activity-sensing capabilities of the prototype in combination with the changing weather conditions in the course of the user study. Furthermore, the participants would like to see a system with a better awareness of the context of use, such that the system can better select the right timing for motivational cues. These findings will be used to improve the design concept and perform a longitudinal user study in the field.},

 abstract = {Dementia affects large number of elderly, manifested with memory impairment symptoms at the onset. This results in difficulties for elderly in scheduling and completing daily activities. In this respect a context-aware reminder system becomes an essential tool in helping elderly navigate their daily activities. Current work on reminder systems typically follows a set of pre-defined activities, organised into a plan. The plan is then used to prompt the elderly to execute specific activities or actions if they have not been completed. However, this is less than an ideal scheme, since the elderly sometimes choose to ignore the reminders due to being engaged in other activities that overlap with the scheduled activities. Therefore, a more flexible schedule is required, that delivers reminders in a context-appropriate manner. Such system must take into account not only the planned activities, but also the current activities of the elderly. We address this problem by monitoring the activities of the elder through our activity recognition system and using this information as a feedback to the reminder system. The reminder system can then decide whether a reminder prompt is appropriate to be delivered or should it be postponed for at a later time. We present the results of activity recognition and discuss how they affect the context-appropriate reminder system.},

In this paper a BAN designed for falls assessment among elder patients (65+ years) is presented, with an emphasis on the communication scheme chosen. The FrameComm MAC protocol described in this paper employs three data management techniques, 1) message priority, 2) opportunistic aggregation and 3) an adaptive duty cycle, all of which are designed to ensure that patient vital signs (i.e. data packets) are delivered under a variety of network loads. The protocol is evaluated using a small laboratory network, initially configured to communicate Beat-to-Beat (continuous blood pressure) readings when a patient goes from a sitting to a standing position and then with added ECG (ElectroCardioGram) readings.},

 abstract = {Body sensor networks (BSN) can capture physical phenomena from a human body, contextual information from the environment and high level events of a person. Associating contextual information and events with the captured raw sensory data can serve as a crucial input for many applications such as e-health. For example, to accurately and timely monitor an elderly person with several physical disabilities while he is at home or outdoors, the context and event information along with raw sensory data needs to be reached to an e-health service provider to assist in taking time critical decision. Such process includes receiving the sensory data, analyzing it to trigger necessary services such as sending an alert message to the family physician, hospital, emergency service, his immediate caregiver, family members, friends and so on. A BSN also allows members of one's community of interest, referred to as a social network, to query real-time sensory, contextual and event data. Combining the social network with BSN is envisioned to enhance the current state of the art in e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a framework, called SenseFace, that can dynamically pass sensory data from one's BSN to his/her social network and vice versa. Finally, we illustrate the design and implementation of the framework.},

The device augments a conventional rolling walker aid with sensing and navigational abilities to safely travel through an environment following user's perceived intentions, unless collisions or instability is imminent. The agent, embodied as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), critically relies on minimal user input to seamlessly recognise user's short-term intended behaviour, constantly updating this projection to allow for inconspicuous user-robot integration. This, in turn, shifts user's focus from fine motor-skilled control to coarse indications broadly intended to convey intention. Overall, the system can afford an increase in safety for the cognitive user through preventative care - reduced number of falls or collision with surrounding objects, minimising health-care expenses as well as increasing independent living for people with gait disorders. Successful simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed architecture for a practical robotic rollator design.},

This significant figure is a result of several factors, including increasing life expectancy and an ageing population in developing countries. Alzheimerpsilas disease, a form of dementia, is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory loss, and behavior and personality changes. People suffering from this disease become increasingly physically and cognitively impaired; they usually need help with all aspects of daily living. While there is currently no cure for dementia, special therapies (e.g., arts and crafts, music therapy) can help people with dementia to live as good a life as possible. We propose to use socially assistive robots as customized/individualized helpers as a complement to humans. This work proposes a new adaptive socially assistive robotic (SAR) system that aims to provide a customized protocol through motivation, encouragement, and companionship for users suffering from cognitive changes related to aging and/or Alzheimerpsilas disease.

This class of application can benefit from mechanisms to discover resources (devices and sensors) that meet their requirements and mechanisms to monitor the state and provide access to the functionalities of these resources. We present an architecture that includes two essential services to compose the supporting infrastructure required by the mentioned applications: a context service, that provides access to context information, and a discovery service. Resource agents, which encapsulate and provide access to the actual resources and sensors, are also included in the proposal. A reference implementation, based on Web services technology, was used to develop a remote assisted living application, which relies on ambient sensors, placed in each room, to capture context information and on a combo medical appliance to perform blood pressure measurements on the patient, according to a care plan prescribed by a doctor. The collected set of context data may be transmitted to a monitoring center and also interpreted locally using medical knowledge; the identification of a patient's abnormal condition can activate local actions or send an emergency message to a monitoring center. The local infrastructure can help a doctor to monitor and assist the patient while he or she is performing daily activities. It may also help reducing hospitalization time and improving the patientpsilas treatment compliance and quality of life.},

We present a novel event-driven context model for elderly health-monitoring application, which supports a distributed system with multimodal sensors. The context model is a dynamic hierarchical structure modeling human actions, activities, and environment information in home scenario. Context awareness is achieved by detecting events associated to the context hierarchy. Common knowledge ontology is employed to guide high-level context reasoning. Experiments of this method in elderly health monitoring show the effectiveness of the proposed context model.},

 abstract = {The reliability of InP planar PIN photodiodes in humid ambients has been studied. The dependence of the degradation rate in temperature, humidity and bias was determined by aging devices at temperatures between 50 and 150°C, humidities between 50 and 85% RH, and biases between 2 and 25 V. Failure occurred as a result of a sudden increased dark current. This increase in dark current had little affect on the device responsivity. At all aging conditions the failure distributions were well represented by a lognormal distribution in time with a dispersion of less than 0.3. From these data, an acceleration factor (AF) was developed and is given by AF=exp(E/kT)exp[A(RH)2]exp[B(V)] where E=-0.42 eV, A=-4.6×10-4, and B=-6.7×10-2/V. Extensive failure mode analysis was done on more then 500 failed devices. Based on this, a failure mechanism was proposed. The model requires ingress of moisture to the InP surface. The moisture is reduced at the p-contact region of the device region, giving off hydrogen. Under negative bias In and P react with the hydrogen to form gaseous IH and PH 3. This lead to the semiconductor erosion. The erosion continues until device failure occurs. The worst case concentrate of PH 3 which if created would produce less than 0.1 ppb PH3 per cm3 of air. Thus it is not a fire or health hazard. Finally, we present reliability prediction for nonhermetic PIN's encapsulated in an optically clear silicone based polymer. We estimate a 20 year hazard rate of less than 100 FIT's for devices operating at an ambient of 45°C/50% RH. For comparison, the hermetic counterparts of similar design have a 20 year hazard rate of less than 10 FIT's},

 abstract = {Recent advances in wireless technology, sensors and portable devices offer interesting opportunities to enable ubiquitous assistance to individuals in need of prompt help. Providing healthcare services to mobile users, such as, patients, elders, or potential drug abusers, is a rather challenging task. Novel middleware-level supports are required to integrate sensor infrastructures capable of detecting changes in the monitored subjects' health conditions and of alerting medical personnel, and the victim's relatives and friends in case of emergency situations. Along this line, the paper envisions a context-aware middleware-level solution dubbed Pervasive Environment for Affective Healthcare (PEACH). PEACH integrates together various sensors in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) to detect alterations of monitored subjects' affective and physical conditions, aggregate the sensed information, and also detect potentially dangerous situations for the monitored subject. Finally, PEACH aims at providing outdoor assistance to the victim/patient by quickly promoting the formation of ad hoc rescue groups comprising nearby volunteers. Through encouraging results obtained from both simulations and a practical drug-rehabilitation application testbed, the effectiveness of the envisioned PEACH framework is verified.},

Such energy can be used to detect motion, and most importantly falls. Stray signals can be detected in aluminum foil as voltage differences between touched foil (say by hand) compared to that untouched. Spectrum analysis shows the stray electromagnetic noise signal consists substantially of 60 Hz and its harmonics. Also the signal intensity for both touched and untouched monotonically increases with foil area. While personnel monitors find utility in many areas including security, personnel control and activity detection, we believe these putative sensors to be useful in inobtrusive monitoring of elders to provide them with increased independence at a critical time in their lives.},

In this paper, we describe a system for continuous and unobtrusive in-home assessment of gait velocity, a critical metric of function. This system is based on estimating walking speed from noisy time and location data collected by a ??sensor line?? of restricted view passive infrared motion detectors. We demonstrate the validity of our system by comparing with measurements from the commercially available GAITRite walkway system gait mat. We present the data from 882 walks from 27 subjects walking at three different subject-paced speeds (encouraged to walk slowly, normal speed, or fast) in two directions through a sensor line. The experimental results show that the uncalibrated system accuracy (average error) of estimated velocity was 7.1 cm/s (SD = 11.3 cm/s), which improved to 1.1 cm/s (SD = 9.1 cm/s) after a simple calibration procedure. Based on the average measured walking speed of 102 cm/s, our system had an average error of less than 7% without calibration and 1.1% with calibration.},

From a case study that we conducted with six (6) participants we gained an initial understanding of how the elderly manage their medications to avoid the inherent risks associated with medicating that are identified in the literature. From this understanding, we identified how the characteristics for notification systems should be implemented in a system with the goal of supporting an activity carried out by older adults. Thus, we present the design characteristics incorporated into the wearable notification display for medication adherence, which we consider will enable the elderly to easily read and interpret the information presented on the display.},

 abstract = {Robot companions must be able to display social, affective behaviour. As a prerequisite for companionship, the ability to sustain long-term interactions with users requires companions to be endowed with affect recognition abilities. This paper explores application-dependent user states in a naturalistic scenario where an iCat robot plays chess with children. In this scenario, the role of context is investigated for the modelling of user states related both to the task and the social interaction with the robot. Results show that contextual features related to the game and the iCat's behaviour are successful in helping to discriminate among the identified states. In particular, state and evolution of the game and display of facial expressions by the iCat proved to be the most significant: when the user is winning and improving in the game her feeling is more likely to be positive and when the iCat displays a facial expression during the game the user's level of engagement with the iCat is higher. These findings will provide the foundation for a rigorous design of an affect recognition system for a game companion.},

We have defined a centric UbiHOMESERVER with three main roles: use of existing interfaces on proprietary systems for remote monitoring and control, serving the surrounding system as a data gateway and providing content-adaptive user interfaces optimised by properties of end-user client devices. Throughout the entire environment, the goal of user interface design is to keep the interaction experience of an end-user as simple and intuitive as possible.

As a ubiquitous device, UbiPILL is targeted to people having problems in remembering to take their medicine on time.

And the rapidly increasing demanding of daily monitoring with onsite diagnosis and prognosis is driving homecare solutions to integrate more and more sensing and data processing capacities. So a powerful system is needed not only to address the medication noncompliance but also to be used as a pervasive healthcare station in home. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive healthcare solution for medication noncompliance and daily monitoring is proposed using an intelligent package sealed by controlled delamination material (CDM) and controlled by radio frequency identification (RFID). Onsite diagnosis and prognosis capacities for kinds of health parameters are supported due to scalable and intensive computing capacitance of the 2D-Mesh-NoC based multi-core architecture. Additionally, friendly human-machine interface is emphasized to make it usable for the elderly, disabled and patients due to enhanced multimedia performance. Experimental results of an implemented prototype confirmed the necessity of the multi-core architecture and approved the feasibility of the proposed intelligent package.},

 abstract = {Recently, the number of senior citizens who are living alone and taking medicine has been increasing due to population aging. Since they have many risks of incorrect dosing and their caretakers are concerned about their health, we propose iMec System which is composed of iMec (interactive medicine case), Ubiquitous Sensors, and iMec Server. The system assists caretakers in monitoring the dosing condition via web browser. And Moreover, the system send email to caretakers in order to notify sings of incorrect dosing. The iMec, which is a medicine case developed by us, recognizes medicines in it using camera to confirm the quantity of dosing (e.g. take 3 tablets). The Ubiquitous Sensors, which are sensors embedded in house, assists the iMec in estimating the living state of senior citizens in order to confirm the timing of dosing (e.g. after eating breakfast). The iMec Server accumulates the dosing condition of senior citizens periodically. We confirmed that iMec was able to recognize the 3 kinds of medicines by experiments and iMec System was able to estimate the 7 living states by simulations.},

Hence, here we propose an architecture for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and telemedicine that supports pre-hospital health emergencies, remote monitoring of patients with chronic conditions and medical collaboration through sharing health-related information resources. Furthermore, it is going to use medical data from vital signs for, on one hand, the detection of symptoms using a rule system based on Jess (tachycardia, arrhythmia ...) and, on the other hand, the prediction of illness using chronobiology algorithms. This paper proposes a knowledge base to represent general human information, heart details and electrocardiogram parameters based on ontologies and a Jess' rule system to detect anomalies and patterns from electrocardiogram information. This solution has been tested by the research team's staff, using a wearable electrocardiogram.},

 abstract = {We've long heard about the wide functionality that home automation technologies offer for improving our lives and securing our houses. However, price and an unstable domotics market have restricted such systems' deployment. Nowadays, companies offer too technology-dependent solutions that don't cover user demands completely. Meanwhile, research works focus on small innovations on specific parts of home automation systems, which don't consider integration and deployment issues to present practical designs. The system presented in this article considers user requirements, including novel advances, all in an integral home automation solution suitable for many services. The architecture's modular nature allows direct adaptation to specific cases using standard domotic technologies, for managing in-house devices, and a proposal of an IP-based network for connecting the main home automation module with other platform elements. A remote security system has been developed, and managing tasks are enabled via in-home control panels and an advanced 3D application for local and remote homeowner access. The system has been deployed on a prototype house, testing a wide set of domotic services. Moreover, the range of indoor pervasive applications has also been extended to e-health, elderly adaptation, greenhouse automation, and energy efficiency.},

 abstract = {Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in elderly patients is critical and important since this disease became a major public health problem. It is well known the fact that osteoporotic fractures may occur as a result of a combination of the degeneration of trabecular structures and low bone mass. Therefore, the quantitative analysis of human bone trabecular architecture might be useful for treatment and diagnosis of this disease. synchrotron radiation X-Ray micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) enables magnified images with a high space resolution that allows detailed analysis of the trabecular structure. In the quantitative analysis of medical images of human bone, it is necessary to use filters and binarization, nevertheless these techniques may cause loss of information. This paper describes the alternative application of neural computing (artificial neural networks) to the pixel classification in order perform the quantitative analysis of human bone trabecular structure in synchrotron radiation μCT images obtained at the Synchrotron Radiation for Medical Physics (SYRMEP) beam line of the ELETTRA Laboratory at Trieste, Italy. Results demonstrate that, despite the complexity of the trabecular architecture, the ANNs have considerable success in the recognition of bone pixels for the quantitative analysis and that its use is compatible to the characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation images.},

 abstract = {After the ten years rise of ageing population in Taiwan, it has increased the population rate of elders to nearly 10% in year 2009. Since 1990, the day-time aged care service has been implemented over decades in Taiwan. The social welfare has been attended and been actively promoted among the communities with the aged day-care service (ADCS) in recent years. The successful implementation of the ADCS relies on the overwhelming supports from all stakeholders, i.e. instructors, their related families, directors of the organizations and leaders of local communities, but also to understand the emotional needs of elders, ethical care, responses to the self-esteem issues and practical care support exercises by the experienced aged carers. Since the ADCS must deliver relaxed and positive environments for groups of instructors and elders to interact with each other in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment. Thus, the elder's needs must be known in prior of attending the ADCS which could continually improve the aged care service quality. This initial study aims to investigate the context of use of a Web-based prognostics scoring system among stakeholders in order to create a working prototype that provides useful information regarding elder's emotional needs. The system will create a Web-based community among stakeholders in order to actively provide emotion status of specific elders to instructor, which allows instructor to give a special care to specific elders in the assigned ADCS. The prognostics scoring information can be gained based on the elders' attendance rate, positive attitude toward the day-cared treatment, the objective performance of the exercises, and subjective assessment of the emotion scale, which is feed by both instructors, their related family and associated aged carers. It hopes that the design approach and the system and associated products could support a self-sustaining ADCS by the village community itself. Further recommendation will be made.},

In this paper, we present an evaluation of the user experience of a familiar telecare product called a `personal trigger' that provides a means of summoning assistance when help is needed. It is supplied as part of a community alarm service and should be worn at all times for continuous protection. Our evaluation is based on a survey distributed to over 1,300 clients in Moray, North East Scotland with a 60% response rate. The main findings are: clients view the service extremely positively, but almost two-thirds have never used their personal trigger to summon help and less than 8% wear it at all times; over two-thirds of clients wear their personal trigger most or all of the time, predominantly because it makes them feel safer; almost one-third of clients wear their personal trigger only some of the time to not at all, mostly because it is too sensitive or they forget to put it on. The appearance of the personal trigger was found to be less significant, despite the large majority of respondents being women. However, there is a need for better design to make it more comfortable and enjoyable to wear. Over the coming years, many older people will have higher expectations of public services. Designers can make things that are attractive and work well, and should be included in teams that develop telecare technology.},

People often use direct physical contact to guide a person to a desired location (e.g., leading a child by the hand) or to adjust a person's posture for a task (e.g., a dance instructor working with a dancer). Within this paper, we present an implementation and evaluation of a direct physical interface for a human-scale anthropomorphic robot. We define a direct physical interface (DPI) to be an interface that enables a user to influence a robot's behavior by making contact with its body. Human-human interaction inspired our interface design, which enables a user to lead our robot by the hand and position its arms. We evaluated this interface in the context of assisting nurses with patient lifting, which we expect to be a high-impact application area. Our evaluation consisted of a controlled laboratory experiment with 18 nurses from the Atlanta area of Georgia, USA. We found that our DPI significantly outperformed a comparable wireless gamepad interface in both objective and subjective measures, including number of collisions, time to complete the tasks, workload (Raw Task Load Index), and overall preference. In contrast, we found no significant difference between the two interfaces with respect to the users' perceptions of personal safety.},

We design a detection algorithm based on mobile phone platforms. We propose PerFallD, a pervasive fall detection system implemented on mobile phones. We implement a prototype system on the Android G1 phone and conduct experiments to evaluate our system. In particular, we compare PerFallD's performance with that of existing work and a commercial product. Experimental results show that PerFallD achieves strong detection performance and power efficiency.},

 abstract = {Fluid intake is an important information for many health and assisted living applications. At the same time it is inherently difficult to monitor. Existing reliable solutions require augmented drinking containers, which severely limits the applicability of such systems. In this paper we investigate two key components of an unobtrusive, wearable solution that is independent of a particular drinking container or environment. We first describe a system for spotting individual instances of drinking (lifting a container to the mouth and taking a single sip) in a continuous stream of data from a wrist-worn acceleration sensor. We show that drinking motion can be detected across different drinking containers (glass, cup, large beer mug, bottle) on a large dataset (560 drinking motion instances from six users, embedded in 5.84 hours of complex natural activities). An average performance of 84% recall at 94% precision was achieved for the drinking motion spotting. Based on the events derived from drinking event spotting, we show how additional information can be obtained. Specifically, we demonstrate the recognition of container types and fluid level from upper body postures during drinking events. Nine containers and three container fluid levels were evaluated to recognize container type and fluid amounts with three users. Recognition rate for container type was 75%, and for fluid level 72%.},

New communication-based methods to provide health service with personal health care devices and services are considered promising elements of best medical care for everybody. Among all services a system that can help people living with very less support or care takers around them is essential. To achieve this vision, several technological issues have to be solved: (i) body sensors to monitor vital functions like ECG, BP and Body Temperature have to be developed; (ii) the collected sensor data has to be analyzed to detect emergency situations; (iii) relevant data has to be integrated with other information systems in the work environment of medical experts; (iv) information has to be send in secure way using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. These challenges are addressed within the Ubiquitous Health Care System. The goal of the paper is to develop a framework in which health professionals can remotely monitor and diagnose elderly person or patients.},

 abstract = {While pervasive healthcare systems bear the potential to provide patients with a new quality of medical homecare, the complexity of such systems raises fundamental questions of behavior, communication and technology acceptance. This is especially important, as users of future healthcare systems will be increasingly characterized by diversity. Relying only on highly experienced and technology-prone user groups, which might have been typical users in the last decades, is not sufficient anymore. Rather, elderly users, users with a completely different upbringing and domain knowledge, and ill or handicapped people will have to use the systems. Today, the understanding, in which way physical, emotional and cognitive abilities, caused by individual learning histories and health states, may impact the usage and acceptance of pervasive healthcare technologies, is restricted. This research contributes to this topic by investigating the acceptance motives of aged users with different health states regarding three different implementation concepts for medical technologies: medical technology implemented in mobile devices, smart environments and smart clothing. Using the questionnaire method, a total of 82 users between 40 and 92 years of age were examined regarding their usage motives and barriers with respect to the different technology concepts. Overall, it was revealed that acceptance issues and users' needs and wants should be considered in order to successfully design new medical technologies.},

Although the Internet is an effective medium for recording data and reporting everyday health status, health support systems that require the use of a PC can place a heavy burden on users, especially elderly users. In this research, we utilized a sensor information web service which is a home network based on ZigBee, and discuss effective implementation of a follow-up system. We explained and demonstrated the proposed system to participants who had completed a diabetes prevention program and administered a questionnaire about their impression of system use.

The goals of all concerned must be taken into account if the technological advances are to be of benefit to those for whom they are being designed. After the technical assessment was made, a further study of the end users views was aimed to show the acceptance levels of elderly end users to the idea of personal monitoring, its perceived usefulness in their every day lives, and their judgment of the design. This was made in the form of a questionnaire divided into five main areas: usefulness, attractiveness, usability, comfort and acceptance, and each end user was interviewed regarding their goals. Each of the interviewees regarded their own continuing independence as a primary goal; however their views as to the possibility of achieving this goal by the use of advanced technology differed. This work was completed as part of the EMERGE project, aimed at the support of elderly people in everyday life using innovative monitoring and assistance systems, with the use of ambient and unobtrusive sensors in order to increase their safety, thereby promoting a longer period of independence, a step made necessary by the demographic increase in the elderly population in Europe.},

In case of a positive response or no response at all, the emergency situation is notified to the responsible persons, in order to get timely and effective help. Along with personal information and a short medical history of the elderly person, a patch of masked video showing the emergency event is also transmitted. The masked video on one hand maintains the privacy of the elderly people and on the other hand it helps the administrators to diagnose the problem accurately. Masked video is also helpful to provide specific initial first aid. In order to ensure timely help, the system receives acknowledgement for the sent emergency call. Some of the elderly people desire to be checked on a periodic basis. Our system gives the administrators a facility to check the state of the person at any time, which gives the elderly person a sense of safety and mental satisfaction.},

As care and rehabilitation practices move, to a greater extent, out of the hospitals and into private homes a new take on PD is needed to facilitate design activities with patients or laypeople as the primary user groups and to design healthcare applications to be used primarily in the home. This paper discusses challenges and possibilities related to the design of home-based healthcare applications and especially the users' possibilities for participation in creative PD activities. Based upon ongoing design-work, related to home-based rehabilitation of elderly suffering from vestibular dysfunction (dizziness), this paper presents lessons learned and initial outcomes related to patient/citizen-focused development of healthcare solutions for private homes. We present initial ideas on how PD can be used to develop pervasive healthcare applications with less resourceful user-groups such as elderly people suffering from illness.},

Possible application fields may be early detection or differential diagnosis in dementia and assessment of fall risk. Regarding the challenges of future health systems due to the demographic change delaying need of care or preventing falls in dementia can help decrease costs while increasing perceived quality of life for people concerned and their carers. Within this paper we present our theoretic concept and algorithm for computing self-selected gait velocity utilizing measurement from a laser range scanner.

 abstract = {Recognition of inhabitants' activities of daily living (ADLs) is an important task in smart homes to support assisted living for elderly people aging in place. However, uncertain information brings challenge to activity recognition which can be categorised into environmental uncertainties from sensor readings and user uncertainties of variations in the ways to carry out activities in different contexts, or by different users within the same environment. To address the challenges of these two types of uncertainty, in this paper, we introduce the innovative idea of incorporating activity duration into the framework of learning inhabitants' behaviour patterns on carrying out ADLs in smart home environment. A probabilistic learning algorithm is proposed with duration information in the context of multi-inhabitants in a single home environment. The prediction is for both inhabitant and ADL using the learned model representing what activity is carried out and who performed it. Experiments are designed for the evaluation of duration information in identifying activities and inhabitants. Real data have been collected in a smart kitchen laboratory, and realistic synthetic data are generated for evaluation. Evaluations show encouraging results for higher-level activity identification and improvement on inhabitant and activity prediction in the challenging situation of incomplete observation due to unreliable sensors compared to models that are derived with no duration information. The approach also provides a potential opportunity to identify inhabitants' concept drift in long-term monitoring and respond to a deteriorating situation at as early stage as possible.},

Three elderly participants interacted with the Nabaztag, a zoomorphic robot, for 10 days to improve their overall health condition. Hedonic factors were not found to be important for the acceptance of the Nabaztag. However, these factors seemed to be important for building a relationship with the Nabaztag. Social factors were found to be important for the acceptance of robots, but not for building a relationship with the Nabaztag. The results yielded some interesting findings that need more study: (1) the relationship between the place of the Nabaztag and acceptance and use, (2) the relationship between naming the Nabaztag and building a relationship with it and (3) the relationship between using verbal/non-verbal communication and building a relationship with it.},

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) encompasses technical systems to support elderly people in their daily routine to allow an independent and safe lifestyle as long as possible. Keep In Touch (KIT) uses smart objects and technologies (Near Field Communication and Radio Frequency Identification) to facilitate telemonitoring processes. Closed Loop Healthcare Services take use of KIT technology and are capable of processing relevant data and establishing communication channels between elderly people and their environment and different groups of care-givers (physicians, relatives, mobile care providers). The combination of KIT technology (smart objects) and Closed Loop Healthcare Services results in an applied IoT infrastructure for AAL scenarios. Already applied IoT and AAL applications in telemonitoring and medication intake compliance projects show that these applications are useful and accepted by the elderly and that the developed infrastructure enables a new form of communication between people and people, people-to-people (P2P) communication. The personal communication between elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers is an important aspect in AAL. Through the combination of KIT and Closed Loop Healthcare, a central AAL paradigm can be realized through the IoT, where the elderly live in their homes with smart objects, thus smart homes, communicating to the outside world in an intelligent and goal-orientated manner.},

The emerging ambience intelligence (AmI) technology suggests itself to be of great potential for EHA applications, owing to its effectiveness in building a context-aware environment that is sensitive and responsive to the presence of humans. This paper presents a case-driven AmI (C-AmI) system, aiming to sense, predict, reason, and act in response to the elderly activities of daily living (ADLs) at home. The C-AmI system architecture is developed by synthesizing various sensors, activity recognition, case-based reasoning, along with EHA-customized knowledge, within a coherent framework. An EHA information model is formulated through the activity recognition, case comprehension, and assistive action layers. The rough set theory is applied to model ADLs based on the sensor platform embedded in a smart home. Assistive actions are fulfilled with reference to a priori case solutions and implemented within the AmI system through human-object-environment interactions. Initial findings indicate the potential of C-AmI for enhancing context awareness of EHA applications.},

Delays in diaper change can cause serious social and medical issues. So, timely and effective continence management is important to potentially avoid the undesirable consequences. By developing assistive system leveraging on sensors, wireless sensor network, ambient intelligence and reminders, it is feasible to detect soiled diaper and remind the carers for timely intervention.

The development of accurate motion analysis models, however, requires the integration of multi-sensing modalities and the utilization of appropriate data analysis techniques. This paper describes a robust framework for improved patient motion analysis by integrating information captured by body and visual sensor networks. Real-time target extraction is applied and a skeletonization procedure is subsequently carried out to quantify the internal motion of moving target and compute two metrics, spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory, for each vision node. Extracted motion metrics from multiple vision nodes and accelerometer information from a wearable body sensor are then fused at the feature level by using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and used to classify target's walking gait into normal or abnormal. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

The development of patient-specific gait analysis models, however, is challenging since it is unfeasible to obtain normal and impaired gait examples from the same patient before the operation in order to build supervised models for gait classification. This paper presents a novel VSN-based framework for quantification of patient-specific gait impairment and post-operative recovery by using change analysis. Real-time target extraction is first applied to VSN data and a skeletonization procedure is subsequently carried out to quantify the internal motion of moving target and compute two features; spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory for each vision node. Change analysis is then used to measure the change, i.e. difference, between two unlabeled datasets collected pre- and post-operatively and quantify gait changes. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient gait monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

 abstract = {Surveillance systems are becoming ubiquitous nowadays. Their use is sometimes followed by misuse which often raises ethical questions that have implications for all involved in the design, control, and implementation of surveillance schemes. Spanning across the disciplines of interior design/architecture and camera networks present conceptions of surveillance systems often disregard the social dimension, or those `being watched.' Debates raise concerns as people associate cameras with feelings of fear and control, loss of privacy, discrimination, inequality, and cultural/gender insensitivity. Began as an interdisciplinary collaboration between the University of Minnesota's Interior Design program and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the `Socializing Surveillance' project matured into a joint endeavor undertaken by four faculty advisors and five electrical and computer engineering students through the “ECE 4951: Senior Design” Project in Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. This paper outlines the pertinent issues starting from an optimization approach to place cameras and in-depth interviews with design practitioners that led to a re-thinking of what surveillance and camera networks can entail; the challenges and opportunities afforded through interdisciplinary educational efforts; and the attempts of the team to develop a prototype for an interactive surveillance system that foregrounds the social dimensions of a security scheme. The goal is to ignite interest in surveillance and to set in place considerations for interdisciplinary educational models.},

The most likely to benefit from these smart homes are people in loss of autonomy such as the disabled people or the elderly with cognitive deficiencies. But it becomes essential to ease the interactions with the smart home through dedicated interfaces, in particular, thanks to systems reactive to vocal orders. Audio recognition is also a promising way to ensure more safety by contributing to detection of distress situations.

 abstract = {Pervasive healthcare environments provide an effective solution for monitoring the wellbeing of the elderly where the general trend of an increasingly ageing population has placed significant burdens on current healthcare systems. An important pervasive healthcare system functionality is patient motion analysis where gait information can be used to detect walking behavior abnormalities that may indicate the onset of adverse health problems, for quantifying post-operative recovery, and to observe the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of accurate motion analysis models, however, requires the integration of multi-sensing modalities and the utilization of appropriate data analysis techniques. This paper describes a simple and robust framework for improved patient motion analysis based on an ambient and a wearable sensor. Using visual information from a single vision sensor, target segmentation is first carried out and a skeleton extraction procedure is subsequently applied to quantify the target internal motion by computing two metrics, spatiotemporal cyclic motion between leg segments and head trajectory. Extracted accelerometer information from a wearable body sensor is fused with the extracted metrics at the feature level by using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify target's walking gait into normal or abnormal. The potential value of the proposed framework for patient monitoring is demonstrated and the results obtained from practical experiments are described.},

The infrastructure is generic and allows for optimisation for a variety of applications by the development of dedicated services that can be distributed over (wearable and ambient) sensor nodes, the WSN gateway, and the enterprise (backend) system. Key to many applications, such as elderly care considered in this paper, is to optimise the battery lifetime of wearable sensor nodes that can be (remotely) customized to the monitoring needs of individual persons and to the quality-of-service demands for offered services. The WASP infrastructure provides practical solutions for these targets and is being validated for realistic elderly care scenarios.

The platform is based on state-of-the-art software development techniques like OSGi and Spring, which enable modularity and flexibility.

Support for mobility is a key aspect in AAL, and makes elderly people feel very independent and socially integrated. This paper describes an AAL solution to support elderly people outside home: provides information and assistance at the street near public buildings, and inside public buildings. The concept of bubble is proposed in this paper as a physical space where it is possible to consume to a number of local services. Presented mobility-based AAL Services are integrated with an ambient assisted home, so users perceive mobility service as an extension of the care chain beyond the boundaries of their homes.},

The domain of home assistance also includes caring for the elderly. Healthcare services globally are seeking to allow people to stay in their familiar home environments longer due to the multitude of benefits associated with living in non-clinical environments and technologies to determine an individual's movements are key to ensuring home emergencies detected through lack of movement can be responded to promptly. This paper proposes a device-free technique which would enable the individual to proceed with normal daily activities without the concern of having to wear a traceable device. The principle behind this is that the human body will absorb/reflect the signal being transmitted from a transmitter to one or more monitoring stations. Results are presented which demonstrate that human detection and tracking is possible to within 1.5m resolution.},

The target is a multifunctional customized handheld display and input device connected to the AAL environment. Positioning is achieved using TDoA distance measurement and a multilateration algorithm. To fulfill the low energy requirement, wall nodes are woken up only for positioning cycles by an ultrasonic pulse decoded by a custom electronic circuit and RF traffic is modelled with a small protocol footprint.},

For assessing activities of daily living, one of the most challenging problems for research remains that of accurate transition detection and characterisation. Early detection of a change in these transitions, such as difficulty getting up from a seated position, can be an indicator of further complications which often precede a fall. Such changes can also accompany early stage neurological disorders which can be treated effectively to improve quality of life. In this paper, we present a system for the accurate characterisation of motion based upon the fusion of ambient and wearable sensors. A probabilistic, privacy respectful method for the extraction of detailed 3D posture information is proposed and fusion with an ear-worn accelerometer and gyroscope is discussed. We present results detailing high accuracy in the recognition of complex motions over four subjects.},

 abstract = {The advancement of medical technology greatly extends people's lifespan. Nevertheless, the continuous falling of birth rate has promoted an “aging population” in many nations. It also means that more emphasis will be placed on improving the quality of life and care for the elders. Most long-term care services in Taiwan are provided on an institutional basis by nursing homes due to the structural changes in society and family. Traditional family-based home care system is perishing. Once an elderly people are unable to care for himself, he must be placed in a nursing home. The majority of the elderly, however, would much prefer "age in place" and live out their lives where they belong. Taiwan and other countries around the world are all striving for establishing pervasive community care services. To provide more responsive and personalized care services, this research aims to develop a “Smart Community Care System (SCCS)” based on the concept of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Mobile Agent (MA) technologies. Caregivers may locate care-receivers easily in a community with RFID while MA furnishes timely and accurate information for the care provision. The care historical data can be automatically recorded as well. The SCCS is expected to be able to promote the pervasive community care services with convenience, context awareness and accuracy.},

Given their condition, elders could be involved in situations that may affect their physical integrity or quality of life, and caregivers may be unaware of the situation or not be able to attend it on time. This paper proposes a context-aware notification environment to support the work of caregivers. The aim is to increase the caregiver's awareness about the situations of care of older people in a nursing home, so that caregivers could act appropriately and timely to attend those situations. Firstly, we present the results of a study to understand the situations of care that occur at a nursing home. Later, we propose the design of a context-aware notification environment whose design was informed by this understanding. One of the main features of this environment is that it takes into consideration the contextual information both from the caregiver and from the elder in order to adapt the notification. Preliminary results of the evaluation of an implementation with an audio notification mechanism are promising. During the evaluation period caregivers perceived an increase in their awareness of the situations of care and a safer working environment regarding the provided quality of care.},

 abstract = {Deep design outlined in the paper is a new approach, where not only tasks, immediate emotions or habits and behaviours are considered. Deep design aims to identify sources of emotionally rich and strong experiences and feelings in order to augment them subsequently by means of smart technology. The most intrinsical needs of users, their deep needs, should be revealed and reflected in the process. Evaluation of a new technology is described as a successive process, starting with immediate decision, followed by short-term acceptance and finally long-term appropriation driven by the deep needs in a role of high order reinforcers. Deep design builds on various existing human-centric and emotion-driven approaches, but brings them further, or maybe rather deeper, bringing deep psycho-technical and socio-technical factors on the highest levels of importance. The idea of deep design is being introduced in a context of ambient technologies for elderlies, because actually there are certain dissonances in what do elderlies need and what many current intelligent technologies offer. As we show in the paper, our research in sources ranging from gerontology to ambient intelligence revealed four clusters of deep needs of elderlies-social touch, autonomy with anticipated support, feeling of being competent and feeling of helpfulness and self-worth.},

In this paper, method of using a single waist-fixed accelerometer to detect human movement pattern was investigated and evaluated. 10 subjects were asked to run or walk on a treadmill in a regular way. A 5th order Butterworth low pass filter with cutoff frequency 20Hz was designed to filter the acceleration data and denoise the sample. By collecting the velocity from treadmill as label data and the individual's waist acceleration data, training data set was established. A Bayesian network classifier trained by EM learning algorithm was developed for human movement pattern assessing. Experiment showed that the method could predict the human walking and running state with a considerable accuracy more than 90%. Such accuracy could also be achieved even with a single superior-inferior acceleration feature. The classification of fast speed walking and normal speed one also achieved satisfying result. This indicated that in some application in which walking and running state were only needed to classify could employ the low power, low computational complexity uniaxial accelerometer as the human movement detector.},

Currently, a growing body of research supports the effectiveness of using non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the decline of or improve brain functioning in people suffering from dementia. However, implementing and sustaining such interventions on a long-term basis is difficult as they require considerable resources and people, and can be very time-consuming for healthcare staff. Our research focuses on making these interventions more accessible to healthcare professionals through the aid of robotic assistants while validating their effectiveness. The objective of our work is to develop intelligent socially assistive robots as therapeutic aids designed to maintain, and even improve, the residual social and cognitive functioning in persons with dementia. In this paper, we study the social interaction attributes of our human-like socially assistive robot, Brian 2.0, during a person-centered cognitively stimulating activity to determine if the robot is able to engage a person in the activity by providing task assistance, encouragement, reinforcement, and celebration. Our preliminary proof-of-concept results show that the social interaction capabilities of Brian 2.0 are effective in engaging individuals in a cognitively stimulating game.},

The quantity and quality of sleep may be a reflection of their dementia condition and affect the quality of life for people with dementia. In this paper we present our research in using sensor based technology for a telecare service to monitor daily activities over a period of three months for one healthy elderly client and one client with early dementia using assistive technology. We analyze their sleep patterns, propose a set of measures to assess the quantity and quality of sleep, and visualize the sleep patterns for a telecare service provider and carers to support users with dementia. Results show that people with early dementia have more alternations of sleep-wake cycles than healthy elderly people, and assistive technology can provide objective and ubiquitous monitoring of sleep patterns for health care purposes.},

The company was surveyed in 2009 and responses from 19 managers and 36 non-managers were carefully studied. The biggest challenges of Scrum for managers were keeping up with the team and learning to "let go" and stop micro-managing the teams. Managers report Scrum increases productivity (73%), increases quality (58%), and makes it easier to change direction (84%). The role of the manager changes from telling people what to do into communicating goals and visions (a key insight of Takeuchi and Nonaka). Increased responsibility of the team affects hiring practices of managers in a Scrum company.},

Gradual shrinkage of the working population has brought shortages of workers performing various services such as elderly care. Women are potential workers, but social assistance of working women remains insufficient. Social services such as elderly care and support for working women must be developed to address these problems. The infrastructure for future ubiquitous services must be designed as a service platform to provide those services respecting individual personal circumstances and at socially acceptable cost. Ubiquitous services provide enhanced mobility. Future ubiquitous services will evolve toward enhanced pervasiveness, and will be defined as advanced personalized services. This report presents a new concept, Socio-familiar Personalized Service (S-P Service), for future ubiquitous services based on sociality and humanity. Moreover, we propose a scalable distributed authentication method to realize S-P Service.},

In this paper we propose a network based Wireless Single PMS (NWSPMS), which can monitor multiple patients to measure various physical parameters. This must be precise, fast and effective for transmission of information about their health condition to the concerned. Also there lies a need to transmit more parameters and more data for the convenience and fast response by the staffs in the hospital. Since we need an immediate response, we make use of the voice-call facility apart from the SMS mechanism via an GSM modem.

None of the common sensing modalities including visible optical, infra-red, and ultra-sound can operate under different visibility conditions, without Line-Of-Sight (LOS), under environmental noise, and measure human-specific features simultaneously. Radio Frequency (RF) sensors have been used to localize humans, and monitor their gait and vital signs. Most of these RF sensors transmit a Continuous Wave (CW) modulated or un-modulated waveform and detect the Doppler shift caused by the movement of hearts, lungs, and other body parts the latter referred to as micro-Doppler technique.

 abstract = {Through an integration of wireless communication and sensing technologies, the concept of a body sensor network (BSN) was initially proposed in the early decade with the aim to provide an essential technology for wearable, ambulatory, and pervasive health monitoring for elderly people and chronic patients. It has become a hot research area due to big opportunities as well as great challenges it presents. Though the idea of an implantable BSN was proposed in parallel with the on-body sensor network, the development in this area is relatively slow due to the complexity of human body, safety concerns, and some technological bottlenecks such as the design of ultralow-power implantable RF transceiver. This paper describes a new wireless implantable BSN that operates in medical implant communication service (MICS) frequency band. This system innovatively incorporates both sensing and actuation nodes to form a closed-control loop for physiological monitoring and drug delivery for critically ill patients. The sensing node, which is designed using system-on-chip technologies, takes advantage of the newly available ultralow-power Zarlink MICS transceiver for wireless data transmission. Finally, the specific absorption rate distribution of the proposed system was simulated to determine the in vivo electromagnetic field absorption and the power safety limits.},

An estimation of relative energy expenditure is computed using motion density from passive infrared motion sensors mounted in the environment. We introduce a new algorithm for detecting visitors in the home using motion sensor data and a set of fuzzy rules. The visitor algorithm, as well as a previous algorithm for identifying time-away-from-home (TAFH), are used to filter the logged motion sensor data. Thus, the energy expenditure estimate uses data collected only when the resident is home alone. Case studies are included from TigerPlace, an Aging in Place community, to illustrate how the relative energy expenditure estimate can be used to track health conditions over time.},

 abstract = {Growth of the elder population gives rise to the increasing demand of long-term elder-care facilities. Most elders living in such facilities suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. Accompanying these illnesses are slow declines of the elders' physical and mental health. Continuous tracking of the elders' daily activities is required to detect the declines early. To facilitate long-term mobility tracking of the elders, we investigate, in this work, the potential of a WSN-based indoor location system as a support for the already-overloaded nursing staff. Through the deployment of a WSN-based Real-Time Indoor Location System (WSN-RTLS) in the university hospital's elder care center for 8 months, we find that: (1) each elder's daily mobility shows a reoccurring pattern. The pattern, however, differs from individual to individual. (2) The mobility level shows a significant variability, i.e., not all elders show reoccurring patterns in mobility levels. These suggest that mere quantity of how much the elders move around the facility will not be a suitable target for behavioral modeling. Exact location of the elders' presence, rather, is more relevant. Insitu WSN-RTLSs would be an enabler towards early detection of the elders' physical or mental decline.},

The main focus of this work is to develop a low-cost, vision-based system for passive activity monitoring of older adults in the home, to capture early signs of illness and functional decline and allow seniors to live independently. Silhouettes are extracted to address privacy concerns. Specific embedded assessment goals include daily gait, fall risk, and overall activity, as well as fall detection. To achieve these goals, accurate, robust segmentation of human subjects (silhouette extraction) from captured video data is required. We present a simple technique that makes use of features acquired from background subtraction results (silhouettes) of multiple calibrated cameras, along with the 3D voxel object formed from the intersection of those multiple silhouettes in a volume space to improve human segmentation results in dynamic environments; moving objects, non-human objects, and lighting changes often complicate this task. The technique is qualitatively evaluated on three data sequences, two of which were captured in an independent living facility for older adults.},

 abstract = {The convergence of Internet and mobile devices has radically changed the way people communicate and interact with each other, and demand for applications that are "social" enough to assist their daily interactions. To support such device mediated interactions, the social relationships between actors need to be systematically modeled and represented. In addition, an application facilitating such interactions should be able to deal with the task conflicts that occur when an actor is involved in multiple interactions simultaneously. To address these issues, in this paper we present an approach to modeling and coordinating social interactions with the notion of social context. It supports social interaction modeling from both the domain- and player-centric perspectives. In particular, the player-centric model provides the basis to coordinate multiple interactions in which an actor is involved. We further introduce a fuzzy logic based reasoning technique to infer the overall importance of each interaction, assisting the actor to resolve conflicts and make decisions. Finally, we validate our approach through a prototype implementation and test cases analysis.},

The study has been approved by the relevant human ethics committee. Blood samples were collected in sodium-citrate tubes and stored at −80°C until further analysis. The genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood using the salting out technique. Allele specific primers were designed using the appropriate software. The polymerase chain reaction method was optimised and validated using DNA sequencing technique. Sixty samples from healthy volunteers were analysed. The results demonstrated that 85% of the subjects had CC allele, 12% had CT allele and 3% had TT allele. The assay would be useful for detection of the polymorphism in GRIN2B gene since the variations that occurred in the analysed samples were more than 1%. Recently, the gene has been reported to be associated with human brain volume (temporal lobe). It was also reported that the reduced temporal lobe volume in the elderly was associated with an increased in Alzheimer's disease risk. The optimised method will be used subsequently to elucidate the type and frequency of GRIN2B polymorphism among Alzheimer's disease patients in Malaysia.},

 abstract = {The Second Life (SL) multi-user virtual environment offers researcher opportunities to experiment with its rich communication, virtual collaboration, and 3-D content creation integrated tools. The SL synthetic world has already revealed great potential for heritage, education and learning but much of the existing applications made have focused on engagement with digital native audiences. The contribution of this paper identifies the importance of developing and designing tailored virtual places which older members of society can utilize easily and safely within this context, with a focused application of addressing social isolation, enabling well being and lifelong learning. In this paper we also discuss our experiences of introducing SL to an elderly community and imparting to them the skills required to interact within the 3D environment and the resources that we developed to support their induction and training. This paper explores the impact of this approach and signposts next steps in experimenting with the use of SL as a domesticated digital technology tool that offers potential to support Ageing Well in our Information Society. We believe that we are the first researchers to conduct a small scaled pilot study of this kind with two elder members of society both aged over 75.},

 abstract = {Wayfinding ability has a high adaptive value, allowing humans to efficiently explore an environment in order to have a goal-oriented activity. The ability to orient in space starts declining with age and it constitute one of the main signs of cognitive impairment in neurological patients. Spatial orientation decline constitutes however an high limitation for elderly population and it has a great impact on subject the day-life autonomy and on her/his relatives and caregivers. Despite this, the neuropsychological approach on spatial cognition does not allow researchers and clinicians to have an accurate assessment of patient's everyday wayfinding ability. This could be critical in a borderline situation, such as in an age-related cognitive decline, in which spatial stimuli can be correctly individuated even if wayfinding is compromised. The main aim of this contribution is to introduce preliminary data about a spatial evaluation procedure - the VR Maze test - on healthy elderly and Alzheimer's population. This will support the identification of specific treatments able to prevent the cognitive decline in elderly and the rehabilitation of spatial orientation in neurological patients.},

The prime challenges of the AAL are recognition of the assisted person's current activity and providing appropriate support to the person. But these systems need extensive studies on user modeling to be more efficient to adapt the changes of user capabilities and preferences which is strongly correlated with the prime challenges of AAL.

Corresponding experiments have been set up to collect both ECG data and upper-body accelerations from two healthy participants.

Telehealth systems are gaining popularity among elderly users, but such applications are mostly doctor-centric and are predominantly used for managing and/or treating diseases instead of preventing them. They do little to motivate patients to change their lifestyle and proactively manage their health. To address these shortcomings, we propose a web-based telehealth system, which uses Web 2.0 technologies in order to add social support and user defined content. In this study, we determine the functional and interface requirements of the system by conducting open individual semi-structured interviews with eight elderly people of age range 60 to 87. A paper prototype and three interfaces of existing Web 2.0 health applications were used to determine the optimum user interface design of the system. A qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate the responses. Overall, the respondents were positive about the idea of using the web to manage their healthcare from home and made several suggestions such as including applications to manage their diet, physiotherapy exercises to improve their health conditions and simple network games to reduce loneliness.},

 abstract = {Wireless body sensors combined with ubiquitous Wireless Sensor Networks enable pervasive healthcare applications. This technology can significantly improve the quality of life of chronically ill and elderly. Remote medical monitoring applications consist of many features as continuous medical monitoring, emergency alerts, location tracking and home automation. These heterogeneous systems have to implement Quality of Service mechanisms to ensure that the different functions have their QoS requirements satisfied, that the most important traffic still has its QoS requirements fulfilled in case of network overload and finally that QoS mechanisms are able to adapt dynamically depending on the context. From our knowledge, QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks for healthcare has never been studied from the context-awareness specific perspective, although context-awareness is the core issue of WSN for healthcare and that these networks have specific characteristics in comparison with most WSN. Health monitoring applications demand high reliability as life of human beings is involved, therefore Quality of Service support in such systems is vital. As patient may evolve from a non-critical health status to a critical one, context-awareness is essential to adapt the network performance to the new situation. In this paper we study the specific QoS requirements of healthcare applications. Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of related work regarding these characteristics and context-awareness. Finally, we point out remaining challenges and open research issues.},

 abstract = {Today elderly people are the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries, and they desire to live as independently as possible. But independent lifestyles come with risks and challenges. Medical in-home telemonitoring (and, more generally, telemedicine) is a solution to deal with these challenges and to ensure that elderly people can live safely and independently in their own homes for as long as possible. In this context we propose an automatic in-home healthcare monitoring system for several uses and to meet the needs identified above. The proposed telemonitoring system is a multimodal platform with several sensors that can be installed at home and enables us to have a full and tightly controlled universe of data sets. It integrates elderly physiological and behavioral data, the acoustical environment of the elderly, environmental conditions and medical knowledge. Each modality is processed and analyzed by specific algorithms. A data fusion approach based on fuzzy logic with a set of rules directed by medical recommendations, is used to fuse the various subsystem outputs. This multimodal fusion increases the reliability of the whole system by detecting several distress situations. In fact this fusion approach takes into account temporary sensor malfunction and increases the system reliability and the robustness in the case of environmental disturbances or material limits (Battery, RF range, etc.). The Fuzzy logic fusion methods brings high flexibility to the telemonitoring platform especially in combining modalities or adding other sensors. The proposed telemonitoring system will ensure pervasive in-home health monitoring for elderly people.},

The simulated diabetes assistant was displayed on a small screen device as well as on a very large display, simulating an ambient assisted living environment. In a second step, the navigation behavior of younger and older diabetes patients as well as healthy users was assessed. Results show that age and display-size have a big impact on the device interaction, independently of domain knowledge. Furthermore, it was found that simple usage of a bigger screen could be helpful for tutoring patients in using a mobile electronic living assistant.},

Moreover, the results are translated into appropriate feedback to the user to assist the correct exercise execution.

 abstract = {This paper presents an approach to structuring knowledge and reasoning for high-level interpretation of sensor data in e.g. independent living applications. The main contribution is to use generalized events, described in terms of `space-time chunks', as a unifying and simplifying structuring principle. We use reasoning with ontologies and rules in combination with a database system, and also incorporate numerical computation. We show that an easy to use modeling formalism is obtained, and that reasoning is feasible at the time of service request, by using R-entailment, which enables efficient exploitation of ontologies and rules in the presence of RDF data. Two applications were built using the approach described in this paper, both of which are related to monitoring well-being of elderly people, and both of which use simple, low-cost sensors.},

 abstract = {A novel approach to fully automating the Timed Up & Go (TUG) assessment test in professional and domestic environments is presented. The approach, called aTUG, is based on the usage of ambient sensor technologies i.e. two light barriers, four force sensors, and a laser range scanner built into a single apparatus i.e. a chair. aTUG supports execution and documentation of traditional TUG and enhanced component-based TUG. aTUG defines five components: Standing up, walking there, turning, walking back, and sitting down. Algorithms for detection of those components and for computation of their duration and the duration of the whole TUG are presented. An experiment with five elderly patients aged 74-91 years, four female, one male, most multi-morbid has been conducted in a residential care facility in Oldenburg, Germany. Results of the experiment show that aTUG can reliably and precisely measure total duration of TUG and durations of the single components with mean error of only 0.05 seconds and mean standard deviation of 0.59 seconds using especially its force and range measurements. German patent is pending for the presented approach.},

Particularly, we investigate (1) the needs of telemonitoring for this particular domain, and (2) the requirements for such a telemonitoring system. For our investigation, we performed an extensive study of the literature, as well as performed interviews with 36 individuals active in the field. As a result, we established numerous needs to be considered, being foremost information need on safety, with regard to care response on emergencies (e.g., falling incidents, wandering), as well information need on dependence on care, with regard to inactivity, self-neglect and loneliness. Subsequently, we established numerous requirements to be addressed, being foremost the use of non-wearable sensors, unobtrusiveness, durability, reliability, privacy, and ubiquitousness. In our discussion of the requirements, we detailed specifically the topics of focus, functionality, and form of a telemonitoring system for this domain.},

Healthcare expenses are dramatically rising due to growing elderly population. Many current technologies for gait analysis are laboratory-based and can incur substantial costs for the healthcare sector for treatment of falls. However utilization of alternative commercially available technologies can potentially reduce costs. Accelerometers are one such option, being ambulatory motion sensors for the detection of orientation and movement. Smart mobile devices are considered as non-invasive and increasingly contain accelerometers for detecting device orientation. This study looks at the capabilities of the accelerometer within a smart mobile device, namely the iPhone, for identification of gait events from walking along a flat surface. The results prove that it is possible to extract features from the accelerometer of an iPhone such as step detection, stride time and cadence.},

In this paper, we employed mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to represent the Doppler signatures of various human activities such as walking, bending down, falling, etc. Then we used two different classifiers, SVM and kNN, to automatically detect falls based on the extracted MFCC features. We obtained encouraging classification results on a pilot dataset that contained 109 falls and 341 non-fall human activities.},

Total Hip Replacement (THR) is the most common procedure to relieve both pain and functional disability experienced by elderly patients suffering from end-stage osteoarthritis, thereby improving their quality of life. The paradigm shift in healthcare on shortening in-hospital care has created an atmosphere of misinformation for both the patient and the medical staff about individual patterns of recovery, creating uncertainty about patients' recovery outcomes. This paper presents work on applying User Centred Design methods (UCD) to inform the design of a qualitative measure which will be used as a means to reduce the lack of information around the patient. The described design process elicits functional system requirements, and guides the design of a qualitative measure based on Experience Sampling Method (ESM). The ESM tool will be used to improve and expand the understanding of elderly patient's living experiences after discharge.},

Our work focuses an the other end of the technology and design spectrum: one where Tele-medicine is used to support optimal palliative care at home, for children at the end of their lives. We present preliminary results of a pilot study. We argue that remote care provision should be considered as an integral part of care, to complement and enhance current end of life care - as well as providing advice and support - regardless of where patients reside. We advocate that future developments in assistive living technologies adopt an increasingly holistic "whole-of-life" approach, including the too often understudied and under-reported end-of-life phase.},

 abstract = {Dynamicity is one of the main challenges in providing sustainable solutions for the homecare domain. The dynamicity of homecare systems, caused by external entities like care-receivers and care-givers, can be addressed through combining distributed and heterogenous services both in design and runtime. In general, several research fields such as dynamic service composition, context-aware service composition and dynamic configuration contribute to provide solutions to handle the dynamicity. However, the dynamicity requirements and constrains in homecare domain demands its own solutions. In this paper, we explain our understanding of a homecare provisioning platform and its external entities which interact with the platform. Based on our application scenario and literature study, we identify different types of changes which are imposed by the external entities. Moreover, the characteristics of the external entities, which need to be taken into account to address the dynamicity, are discussed. Then, we study the existing dynamic service composition approaches to see their feasibility for the homecare domain. Finally, we explain our motivation for choosing a hybrid service composition approach as our basis for the homecare provisioning platform with respect to the identified changes and characteristics coming from the external entities.},

This approach targets to avoid acceptance, usability and reliability issues of available body-mounted fall detectors.

The prototype was evaluated successfully in laboratory and during 507 days in real-life at homes of persons from the target group.

We propose a novel and practical solution using three small wearable wireless Functional Activity Monitor (FAM) sensors and a smartphone to store, transmit, analyze and update data. Three sensors, each composed of a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope, are attached to the chest and both thighs. A computationally efficient signal processing algorithm is designed to accurately measure tilting angles. A continuous activity recognition algorithm is developed using a decision tree based on time series data and spectrum analysis; this algorithm can identify activities of daily life in three general categories: (1) postures such as standing, sitting, and lying; (2) locomotion such as walking; and (3) transitions such as sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. The results show an accurate angle measurement compared to the motion capture system Optotrak 3020 and a reliable detection of all activities with sensitivity at least 96.2% compared to video recordings.},

 abstract = {Rendering and offering adequate reminder services in a situation-aware, proactive manner and providing information for diagnosis support is a major issue for Ambient Assisted Living systems when it comes to dealing with persons suffering from mild dementia. One great challenge therefore is to reliably recognize and assess the long-term behavior of assisted persons. In the context of diagnosis support for caregivers or practitioners, deviations in the daily routine of a person with mild dementia might be an indicator of a deterioration of the affected person's cognitive condition. Based on this information, adequate help can be provided. We developed an approach to processing information regarding the modeling of daily routines and a comparison to previous days. Our solution can be seen as a combination of three approaches: a cosinor analysis based on the theory of circadian rhythms as a special representative of regression analysis, a histogram-based approach based on movement data, and a probabilistic model of behavior (PMB) based on the person's activities of daily living (ADL).},

The affective distress that stems from coping with them could play a negative effect on the health of seniors and lead to severe cases of depression, an emotional disorder that could lead to fatal consequences. The combination of novel methods of ambulatory detection of emotional states, body area networks providing information from numerous bodily parameters, and sophisticated pervasive technologies offers new possibilities in the detection of and intervention in cases of subclinical depression. In this paper we present the technical aspects and rationale behind systems that can use emotional valence monitoring to quantify prolonged emotional negativity and identify the activities associated with such negativity.

Many of these games are also being played by the senior population. Participating in regular training sessions outside their homes can be challenging for elderly, and it is hard to motivate oneself to exercise regularly alone at home. Regular physical activity is important both for the physical and psychological health and it is an integral part of many rehabilitation therapies. In addition, many elderly suffer from loneliness, making social interaction within exergames very important. In this paper we provide a narrative review of how exergames can help to motivate elderly to exercise more, focusing in possible social interactions in online exergaming and persuasive technologies. Finally, we discuss how social exergaming can be used both to prevent loneliness and encourage physical activity.},

Personal care at nursing homes tends to (quite reasonably) have high priority at the expense of social activities, thus creating situations where a number of elderly people experience loneliness. This paper presents ongoing work that focuses on developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for nursing homes that brings together professional care activities and family initiated care. We discuss challenges and opportunities for welfare or assistive technology design to support articulation work in a care setting, where both care professionals and family members (of the elderly inhabitants) co-exists. Furthermore, the care sector at hand suffers from economical limitations that challenge a successful implementation of more costly technologies. We present a concept named Care to Share? that seeks to bring together professional and family initiated care and that assists in the articulation work of social activities in a nursing home.},

 abstract = {Care settings for older people, such as nursing homes, can have low levels of social interaction, which has been shown in many studies as being crucial to both the mental and physical well-being of older adults. Furthermore, increased social interaction has been shown to have a positive effect on adjustment in institutions for the aged. However, these social connections can be lost due to movement within the care system, with residents regularly relocating for a variety of reasons including cost and medical issues. Eleven health professionals and six residents living in a care home in Ireland were interviewed about their social activities and levels of engagement within the home. Storyboards were then developed and presented to the residents based on these interviews. Findings from the interviews indicate that activity levels among the more cognitively able residents are quite low due to activities catering for the less able residents. Furthermore, a lack of access to information and resources (such as books and newspapers) means that these more able residents reported experiencing long periods of boredom. Technology can potentially allow residents access to such information and resources, enabling them to pursue activities in their personal time which can then also be used as the basis for group discussions. The use of technology could, in addition, allow those residents who had moved out of the home to continue to participate and collaborate in activities with the other residents.},

 abstract = {Soaring costs and an aging society originate the need for novel technologies in health care sector. Especially telemedicine and AAL systems are often promoted as such. Enabling patients to stay in their domestic environment while reducing costs due to hospital visits seems to be an evaluable opportunity on the one hand but introduces a lot of challenges, like interoperability and security, on the other. Interoperability is the main challenge to put emphasis on, when thinking of networks of medical devices recording patients vital data while acting in a plug-and-play manner. Thus, standards are needed that enable manufacturers to build interoperable medical devices and provide solutions for cost effective and easy to use telemedicine systems. Therefore this paper analyzes the ISO/IEEE11073 PHD standard towards its applicability in such environments, where the focus lies on self-organization and plug-and-play functionality. Furthermore we want to present research done on telemedicine/AAL systems during the SmartSenior project as well as introduce our own ISO/IEEE11073 implementation, which served as a basis for our analysis.},

The main aim of this research was the early detection of abnormal situations (high/low HR, a fall) and the heart rate variability analysis. The human falls are very risky events that occur not only in the elderly people's daily living but also by epileptics and asthmatics. For these people independent living is strictly forbidden. A wearable sensor based monitoring system can inhibit serious injuries and allow those people live an independent life. Additionally, an SMS messaging module was integrated with the monitoring system. After detecting a non-standard situation a short notice is sent.

Specific design techniques are adopted in order to provide seniors with content that is easily accessible and comprehensible. Some early results of a first prototype are presented. 14 seniors in total, either healthy or with cognitive decline (either mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) have provided feedback on several aspects of platform usability. An additional evaluation component of the platform that is thoroughly investigated is the affective evaluation of the FFA platform. An important conclusion that stems from the present research is the highly significant predictive value of affective states on usability evaluation, highlighting the important role of the entertaining exergaming environment regarding its usability. Further investigation on the enhancement of seniors' affective experience during game play is of utmost importance to us, as there is strong evidence that dynamic game content adaptation according to one's affective state would result into better training adherence and seniors' reinforcement of motivation.},

 abstract = {Falling is one of the leading causes of serious health decline or injury-related deaths in the elderly. For survivors of a fall, the resulting health expenses can be a devastating burden, largely because of the long recovery time and potential comorbidities that ensue. The detection of a fall is, therefore, important in care of the elderly for decreasing the reaction time by the care-givers especially for those in care who are particularly frail or living alone. Recent advances in motion-sensor technology have enabled wearable sensors to be used efficiently for pervasive care of the elderly. In addition to fall detection, it is also important to determine the direction of a fall, which could help in the location of joint weakness or post-fall fracture. This work uses a waist-worn sensor, encompassing a 3D accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, for reliable fall detection and the determination of the direction of a fall. Also assessed is an efficient analysis framework suitable for on-node implementation using a low-power micro-controller that involves both feature extraction and fall detection. A detailed laboratory analysis is presented validating the practical application of the system.},

While meaningful inroads have been made in this area regarding the use of ethical lethal military robots, including work by our laboratory, these needs transcend the warfighting domain and are pervasive, extending to eldercare, robot nannies, and other forms of service and entertainment robotic platforms. This paper presents an overview of the spectrum and specter of ethical issues raised by the advent of these systems, and various technical results obtained to date by our research group, geared towards managing ethical behavior in autonomous robots in relation to humanity. This includes: 1) the use of an ethical governor capable of restricting robotic behavior to predefined social norms; 2) an ethical adaptor which draws upon the moral emotions to allow a system to constructively and proactively modify its behavior based on the consequences of its actions; 3) the development of models of robotic trust in humans and its dual, deception, drawing on psychological models of interdependence theory; and 4) concluding with an approach towards the maintenance of dignity in human-robot relationships.},

The availability of information about a person's physiological state and daily activity makes it possible to judge their health condition and provide predictive diagnoses and treatment. Therefore, a wireless sensing system for monitoring thermal physiological state in the living environment was developed and its functions were evaluated. The system consists of an ear-worn temperature sensor, two thermo-hygrometers, four skin temperature sensors, and an ECG sensor. The level of data loss in wireless communication was low making it possible to estimate physiological state using more than 10 sensors, even though both the IEEE 802.15.4 radio and the specified low power radio coexist. The system was evaluated for the prevention of indoor heat stroke among the elderly. The thermal physiological state and the location were monitored along with ambient temperature and humidity. We propose a method to detect the activities closely linked with heat stroke prevention and change in physiological state and to give appropriate warnings.},

Dynamic vision detectors consist of self-signaling pixels that autonomously react to scene dynamics and asynchronously generate events upon relative light intensity change. Their complete on-chip redundancy reduction, wide dynamic range and high temporal resolution allow efficient and continuous activity monitoring in natural environment. Using a stereo pair of dynamic vision detectors, it is possible to represent the scene dynamics in a 4D space (including time) at a high temporal resolution. In this work, we performed 100 recordings of scenarios including falls in indoor environment using this dynamic stereo vision sensor. Seven features have been extracted and analyzed for three types of falls such that robust parameters will be kept for fall recognition. The result of this analysis is shown in this work with promising outcomes.},

 abstract = {Over the last few decades, the number of senior citizens living alone in Japan has increased rapidly, to the point of dampening economic activity, increasing the load on the social security system, and decreasing the vitality of the local society. In particular, the lack of communication between a large number of elderly people and the local community has become a social problem, and such individuals are a burden on welfare workers and volunteers. With support from Kanagawa Prefectural Government, our joint research team has constructed a support system that would assist welfare workers and volunteers in serving elderly people living alone and building an active local community network. In this paper, we discuss an advanced community model based on the aforementioned information transmission welfare support system for the aging society. We also propose a system that estimates an individual's living conditions by measuring the vibrations caused by sounds such as opening/closing of doors, flushing of the toilet, etc. Experiments revealed that this system efficiently identifies unusual/abnormal activities in households where senior citizens live alone and sends alert signals. This network model provides the necessary support to rescue workers and helps in establishing interactions between elderly citizens and their neighbors; further, it can be used to organize patrol activities.},

The health care becomes a big issue due to lack of medical doctors. Due to these issues there is a paradigm shift from need based health monitoring to preventive health monitoring service. Keeping in view this scenario we developed a Ubiquitous Health care system that helps users to maintain their health and prevents users from falling in disease. Different components of the system are communicating via web services. Web services helps user to maintain its health record remotely and access health parameters anywhere around the globe. Feedback and counseling is also provided with the usage of web service. All these web services are envisioned to host on the cloud service. The central database is also residing on the cloud service. This system is developed using the modern design patterns and complete object oriented concepts.},

 abstract = {The aging population is in demand of new tools for better quality of life. Technology has this power. Aim: This study aimed to assess the impact of using Nintendo Wii® in the elderly. Methods: The impact in balance was measured using Berg scale, the activities of daily living using Barthel, cognitive status using MMSe and perceived health status using SF-36. A sample of 65 seniors from a nursing home was randomly allocated to 3 groups: Wii with the supervision of a Physiotherapist (Group A; n=23), Wii without supervision (Group B; n=20), and just Geriatric Gymnastics (Group C; n=22) during 20 sessions. Results: Better attendance and satisfaction were obtained in Group A. In physical terms significant better results were found in SF 36 on Group A and in Berg score of Group C. In mental assessment, a significant worse result was obtained in SF36 of Group A. Also significantly better results in Vitality and Mental Health of Group B were obtained. In therapy exposure, there were significantly better results in group A of the SF36 in individuals with more than 750 minutes (15 sessions). There were no accidents and/or injury registered during the sessions. Conclusion: The supervised use of the Wii, improves the physical component of the elderly and it also can be a motivating factor for exercise practice. This activity can bring better perception of the vitality of the elderly and physical functioning. In other aspects it may also have a depressive effect on some participants. This study highlights the importance of expert supervision when using a Wii as a therapeutic instrument in a senior population.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the development of a computer-based serious game to enable older individuals to practice Tai Chi at home on their own. The player plays the game by imitating Tai Chi movements presented by a virtual instructor on the screen. The proposed system is decomposed into two modules. The first module is the game design, i.e., the process of recording an instructor training Tai Chi. Acquired data are used to create gesture templates and a virtual instructor. The second module is the game play in which the player attempts to mimic the virtual instructor. Gestures are measured in real-time and then compared with the prerecorded Tai Chi gesture template corresponding to the displayed movement. Visual feedback indicates how well the player imitated the instructor. The proposed system is not designed to classify gestures but to evaluate the similarity of a given gesture with a gesture template. The Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) method is applied to compute such similarity. The proposed approach (1) facilitates the design of assessment tools in which the user has to follow a sequence of predefined movements and (2) applicable to other domains, such as telerehabilitation.},

Research achievements are mainly focused on activities of daily living which are useful for suggesting advises to health care applications. Falling event is one of the biggest risks to the health and well being of the elderly especially in independent living because falling accidents may be caused from heart attack. Recognizing this activity still remains in difficult research area. Many systems which equip wearable sensors have been proposed but they are not useful if users forget to wear the clothes or lack ability to adapt themselves to mobile systems without specific wearable sensors. In this paper, we develop novel method based on analyzing the change of acceleration, orientation when the fall occurs. In this study, we recruit five volunteers in our experiment including various fall categories. The results are effective for recognizing fall activity. Our system is implemented on Google Android smart phone which already plugged accelerometer and orientation sensors. The popular phone is used to get data from accelerometer and results show the feasibility of our method and contribute significantly to fall detection in Health care.},

 abstract = {Determining the location of individuals within indoor locations can be useful in various scenarios including security, gaming and ambient assisted living for the elderly. Healthcare services globally are seeking to allow people to stay in their familiar home environments longer due to the multitude of benefits associated with living in non-clinical environments. Technology to determine an individual's movements or lack of movement is key to ensuring that home emergencies are detected and responded to promptly. This paper proposes a device-free wireless-based localisation (DFL) system which would enable the individual to proceed with normal daily activities without the constraint of having to wear a traceable device. The principal behind this is that the human body absorbs/reflects the radio signal being transmitted from a transmitter to one or more receiving stations. The system design procedure facilitates the use of a minimum number of wireless nodes with the aid of a principle component analysis (PCA) based intelligent signal processing technique. Results demonstrate that human detection and tracking are possible to within 1m resolutions with a minimal wireless hardware infrastructure.},

M-health is defined as "mobile computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care" [1]. This evolutionary concept provides both mobility and 'always connected' functionalities for different healthcare applications. In this paper we introduce a new amalgamated concept of Internet of m-health Things (m-IoT). m-IoT is a new concept that matches the functionalities of m-health and IoT for a new and innovative future (4G health) applications. In principle m-IoT introduce a new healthcare connectivity paradigm that interconnects IP-based communication technologies such as 6LoWPAN with emerging 4G networks for future Internet based healthcare services.

However, this new paradigm requires real-time processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, this article presents an innovative resource provisioning framework that organizes and harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., laptops, tablets, PDAs, DVRs, medical terminals) in home and hospital settings. Novel wireless communication solutions for reliable vital sign transmission and algorithms for acquiring context awareness to support this framework are also discussed.},

Raw WiFi RSS readings and accelerometer sensor data are fused to extract fine grained significant locations in user's daily life. Then, the locations are modeled as trajectories according to the spatial-temporal relationship between locations. The mining phase utilizes different strategies to discover diverse types of behavior patterns by observing long-term regular routines. Therefore, we can mine valuable knowledge from monitor-dependent people's life style and regularity, which makes sense to supply the accessment of life activity measurement, the suggestion of healthy life mode, etc., for the domiciliary elderly.},

 abstract = {Adaptation decisions made by context-aware applications on behalf of users are based on evaluations of current context and preferences of users. This context information is imperfect by nature and can cause applications to behave in ways that users do not expect. Applications that exhibit unwanted behaviour will negatively impact their usability and violate the trust users have in them. Intelligibility and control in applications can help users to understand why they decided to behave in certain ways, and to forgive the applications by enabling users to override the undesirable adaptation. This paper presents a non-monotonic rule based approach (defeasible logic) for modelling user preferences, which serves as the basis of decision-making of application adaptations. It facilitates automatic generation of explanations regarding reasoning of defeasible preferences. The model also supports creation of feedback mechanisms for nontechnical users to formulate their own preferences independently, and modify the adaptation decision process to control application behaviours. Moreover, to demonstrate its applicability we have designed a set of evolvable situations and a context model, which complement the defeasible preferences for building smart home applications to enhance health care of the elderly.},

By accounting for values during the design of technology, designers would be in a better position to create technology that supports rather than hinders the values of its stakeholders. Yet, there are few methodical approaches to dealing with values in design. Moreover, knowledge on how specific value problems can be tackled is not captured systematically in a reusable way. We propose using Value Sensitive Design to analyze recurrent problems and identify affected stakeholders and their values. We use these analyses as a starting point for generating design patterns, or reusable solutions to recurrent problems, that explicitly include value considerations. We provide an initial set of value-sensitive design patterns as a proof-of-concept.},

The paper includes description of our concept of the diagnostic and rehabilitation system with preventative features to decrease the risks of fall and its consequences in elderly. It integrates functions of two systems developed within the two research projects MonAMI (6FP) and SMILING (7FP) where we participated. The main goal is to ensure higher safety for seniors who are in risk of falls and are living alone. The first module of the integrated rehabilitation system is aimed to identification of falls and emergency communication system for the households of elderly living alone. The platform for that is system developed under the 6FP - MonAMI. The second module of the diagnostic and rehabilitation system plays a preventive role as a home rehabilitation device used for regular training of gait during daily activities. The device is based on an innovation of the motorized mechatronic shoe TUKE developed under the 7FP project SMILING. Users train their walk ability during performance of everyday tasks while solving unexpected perturbations simulating influence of external environment by surmounting the uncertainty when stepping on. The complex system is undertaking the challenge to come in market where we see an absence of preventive, diagnostic-rehabilitation centers aimed on people (elderly) with risk of fall. The end users will be rehabilitation clinics, geriatric centers, social services and condition centers, but preferably individual users, mostly seniors.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the concept of an adaptive decision support system for individual persons (ADSIP). ADSIP will serve as a diagnosis assistant for a smart wearable computing system and aims to provide elderly people suffering from chronic diseases with reliable health status diagnosis in real time. The smart wearable computing system addresses unobtrusive and long-term home and outdoor health monitoring, for the purpose of supporting elderly people in leading an independent life with more mobility, flexibility, and safety. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is chosen as the initial application domain. To achieve reliable health status diagnosis, the proposed approach for ADSIP is to individualize the decision support system by means of learning an individual person's health characteristics repeatedly at certain time intervals from measured sensor data and user input, so that a dynamic decision-theoretic model can be adapted gradually to this person's individual health condition. It is expected that with ADSIP, measured deviations from the norm can be categorized either as a critical situation or as a normal uncritical variation, depending on an elderly person's individual health characteristics. As a consequence, false positive health status diagnoses will be reduced and false negative diagnoses will be avoided.},

The goal of this research is to develop a novel computer vision algorithm, which can allow discriminating between abnormal behaviors and normal daily activities using statistical moment analysis and human shape analysis in daytime and nighttime environment. Many researchers recently presented their work aimed at developing an image sensor based application to detect unexpected fall events. Until now, most studies on the abnormal behavior detection of the elderly have been presented for the systems in daytime. However, they cannot give any solution to detect falls in both daytime and nighttime. To overcome the problem, our method is implemented to distinguish abnormal activities from normal activities. Experimental results show very promising results on test image sequences of normal daily activities and simulated fall activities.},

However, if patients and their families without expert knowledge can ascertain how and to what degree they are recovering, it would facilitate the setting of a goal of rehabilitation into society and produce a voluntary training scheme. Therefore, we developed an inexpensive, portable, and maneuverable rehabilitation system using a personal computer and an oversized game controller, which is easy for a paralyzed person to operate. Applying the button-press game, which is the easiest game among those offered with the system, to healthy adults, elderly people without paralysis, and patients with hemiplegia, we measured reaction time and obtained other data. Results show significant differences between the healthy adults and the elderly people without paralysis, and between the healthy adults and the patients with hemiplegia, which suggests that we can evaluate how much a patient is recovering from hemiplegia quantitatively by comparing the reaction times used for maneuvering the system among healthy adults, elderly people, and patients with hemiplegia.},

New challenges are raised to the traditional systems of health care. There is an urgent need to find solutions that allow to extend the time people can live in their own environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility. Residing and being cared in the own familiar environment, in contrast to an institutionalized inpatient setting is becoming more attractive for an increasing portion of the population. Ambient Intelligence and, particularly, the development of Ambient Assisted Living environments can help to minimize hospital stays and, in doing so, enable patients an independent life in a domestic environment. However, the complexity of such systems raises fundamental questions of communication and computer-supported cooperation among components, devices and systems.

 abstract = {The growing number of elderly population at home and abroad necessitates improved approaches to elderly care provision. Elders, often with cognitive and physical impairment, need assistance in their activities of daily living (ADLs), which is usually provided by human caregivers (HCGs). As the demand for caregiver's assistance increases, the shortage of traditional care resources becomes obvious. In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a HCG to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons' activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt HCG depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the HCG but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregiver's acceptance, and their engagement.},

The safety of older and disabled people can be continuously monitored without interrupting their daily routine with intelligent devices and modern sensors located in their home environment and on the body.

Cost-effective, high-impact technologies for aging, disabilities and independent living are urgently needed. In this paper, we present our experience in building “assistive environments” for older adults-the Gator Tech Smart House (GTSH) project. Numerous R&D efforts similar to ours are either underway or have recently been conducted. In most of these projects, prototypes have been built to achieve independence, well being, and in general, good quality of life. But prototyping a technology is one thing; commercial proliferation and creating a vibrant industry around such technology is an altogether different proposition. From the lessons learned in the GTSH, we analyze the impediments hindering the emergence of products and services for assistive environments, and present the blueprints of an ecosystem based on requirements drawn from the lessons learned. We believe the proposed ecosystem is an important beginning to providing better conditions for an accelerated proliferation of next-generation smart homes and assistive environments.},

 abstract = {Technology for care at home is an important factor in supporting our ageing population. These technologies need to be both accessible and acceptable to a wide variety of users if they are to be taken up and successfully used in people's homes. This paper describes the user-centered co-design and evaluation of a multimodal reminder system for the home deployed on mobile devices. Six co-design sessions (N=25 users) were carried out with groups of older users to investigate the best methods and techniques for configuring reminders and how they should be delivered within the home. Both sketches and implemented prototypes were used to gather qualitative feedback on a variety of interaction features and techniques to find what worked best for an older user group. We present the findings from the sessions in terms of the re-design of a personalisable multimodal reminder system. We also present the co-design process used and go on to discuss the value this method adds to the design and evaluation of home care technologies for older users.},

 abstract = {A novel approach to performing unsupervised mobility assessment tests in domestic environments is presented. As a part of the aTUG concept the approach is based on the idea to segment assessment tests into components made up of recurring movement patterns which are measured independently by use of ambient sensor technologies. Quality criteria are defined which compute a score of eligibility for usage of sensor data to assess a certain test component. Valid component measurements are recombined to complete assessment tests according to a technical assessment test description defining the flow of segments and their constraints. An experiment has been conducted within a field trial with five elderly people aged 64-84 years over five weeks. The flats of all people were equipped with home automation (HA) sensors. A laser range scanner (LRS) was placed in one flat. Results from the fully-equipped flat show that the presented quality criteria are suitable to select LRS measurements according to their eligibility to assess a certain component. HA sensors and the LRS were used to compute a self-selected gait velocity of 0.71m/s unsupervised at home. TUG using the aTUG apparatus and a stopwatch was used as clinical reference data yielding a mean gait velocity of 1.18m/s. For the described setting a difference of 0.47m/s between capacity and performance in gait velocity was found.},

To address this problem, at the Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technologies in the University of Missouri we are investigating multiple fall detection systems. In this paper, we present an automatic fall detection system called VAMPIR based on a vertical array of multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors. PIR sensors provide an inexpensive way to recognize human activity based on its infrared signature. To differentiate between falls and other human activities such as walking, sitting on a chair, bending over etc., we used a pattern recognition algorithm based on hidden Markov models (HMM). We obtained encouraging classification results on a pilot dataset that contained 42 falls and multiple non-fall human activities performed by trained stunt actors.},

 abstract = {Sarcopenia is defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging, and is recognized as a major contributing factor to disability and loss of independence in the elderly. Recent evidence shows that age-related loss of muscle strength and power (dynapenia), as well as muscle fatigue are a better predictor of disability. In this paper we describe three ambient casual games that have been designed to measure arm muscle strength and fatigue utilizing a custom-designed interaction device that provides a natural user interface for the games. The games are designed to be used frequently and for short periods of time. We conducted a formative evaluation of the games with 5 older adults to assess ease of use and their interest in playing them. We compare the results of traditional measures of muscle strength using a clinical dynamometer with those obtained using the videogame. The higher frequency with which measures can be obtained from playing the videogame can result in a more reliable and timely assessment of risks of dynapenia and frailty.},

Fall detection devices often rely on dramatized falls when developing algorithms. This study used tri-axial accelerometers worn by older adult research subjects in order to (1) collect false positive data (2) capture potential fall events and (3) evaluate the usability of the device among this target population. Twelve older adults wore activity monitors while participating in structured and unstructured activities. The study collected data on 120 patient days, yielding 492.5 hours of monitored time. Actigraphy data of annotated activities were used to define parameters for refining the algorithm. No falls occurred during the study, but valuable false positive data were collected. The study also obtained information on the usability of the devices and revealed user perspectives on commercializing the final product.},

 abstract = {Identifying different walking conditions is essential in order to monitor the activities of elderly population for active living or fast recovery of a patient following a surgery or even for prognosis and diagnosis of several conditions like Parkinson's disease. This paper looks at automatically detecting three different walking conditions (walking normally with preferred walking speed (PWS), walking while carrying a glass of water, and walking blind folded) using inertial sensor data. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes were used to acquire movement data from both feet during the three gait tasks. Five healthy young subjects undertook 10 trials per condition on a GAITRite mat. Statistical properties such as the mean, standard deviation (std), skewness (skew) and kurtosis were calculated for each trial that included several gait cycles' data. Altogether 48 features were analyzed using Fuzzy Clustering Mean (FCM) algorithm to verify the separable nature of sensor data. The results show that three clusters could be found with an almost equal number of points; however the membership was not high enough to result in complete discrete clusters. Then three different Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to examine whether the conditions could be automatically classified based on the features that were extracted from inertial sensor data. The results indicate 83-84% of accurate classification of the three gait conditions with three SVM algorithms. The study demonstrates that the inertial sensor data could be used to classify differences in walking conditions using powerful computational intelligence techniques.},

 abstract = {Our community is facing serious Aging Society especially in Japan. We have investigated in one of daycare centers which are facilities for elderly care. As the result, we realized that communication is needed for its own sake in these facilities and active communication can cure even depression and dementia. Therefore we propose to cope with these problems using a robot as a communication activator in order to improve group communication. We define group communication as one of types of communication which is formed by several persons. This time, we focus on a recreation game named “Nandoku. ” Nandoku is a quiz which can be described as group communication with a master of ceremony (MC). The system always selects its behavior and target (a participant in the game) to maximize “communication activeness”. Communication activeness is defined as amount of several panelists'(ordinary three: A, B, C) participation, which are calculated with panelists' face direction using camera information. For instance, if participant A is not fully participating by not making eye contact, the system is expected to select one of the behaviors such as “Can you answer, Mr.A?” to encourage A to participate in the game. We experimented with the system in a daycare center. As the result, obvious increase in participation was observed. That offers evidence that the robot can serve a practical role in improving the group communication as a communication activator especially for entertainment use.},

 abstract = {The paper describes the application of a realtime, adaptive battery modelling methodology to Li-ion batteries. This methodology allows accurate estimation of the State-of-Function (SoF) of batteries for an Electric or Hybrid-Electric vehicle. Through use of a Kalman Estimator and online battery model parameter estimation, the voltages associated with monitoring the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery system are shown to be accurately estimated, even given erroneous initial conditions in both the model and parameters. In this way, problems such as self-discharge during non-use of the cells and SoC drift (as usually incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over-charging or ambient temperature fluctuations) are overcome. A further benefit of the adaptive nature of the parameter estimation allows battery ageing (State of Health - SoH) to be monitored and, in the case of safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Moreover, the ability to accurately predict the SoF and changes in battery parameters allows charging scenarios to be optimized to extend lifetime and facilitate future “Vehicle-to-Grid” (V2G) implementation.},

 abstract = {Embedded intelligence entails a vision of the Internet of Things oriented to "Ambient Intelligence", which can be defined as the capacity to collect and analyze the digital traces left by people when they interact with the environment and with such "intelligent things". In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable "things" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which "things" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).},

The main concern of the elder people is their health and its consequences in terms of dependence and also is the primary cause of suffering and self-rated ill health. Since elder people have different health problems that the rest of the population, we need a deep change in national's health policy to get adapted to population aging. This paper describes the preliminary advances of "Virtual Cloud Carer" (VCC), a Spanish national R&D project, whose primary purpose is the creation of new health services for dependents and chronics elder lies, using technologies associated with internet of things and cloud computing.},

 abstract = {Statistics show an aging trend in the world population, which will progressively overload existing health systems. Therefore, we believe that ubiquitous computing will play an important role in domicile settings, coping with the growing need for automated home healthcare support, especially for the sick and elderly. The integration of independently developed off-the-shelf systems (e.g., health-monitoring, entertainment, communications, home automation, etc.) may cause unplanned interactions between them (cf. feature interactions). This is a major concern since the correct/expected behavior of an isolated system may not be the same when deployed in conjunction with other systems, causing interferences, i.e., unexpected outcomes or misbehaviors. The Safe Home Care project tackles this problem to pursuit the safe deployment and reconfiguration of home healthcare smart-spaces. We propose the use of state graphs to represent off-the-shelf systems and predict the occurrence of intra-system's feature interactions. We use pre-deployment simulations to forecast feature interactions before deployment. We assess the applicability and correctness of this approach through a set of simulated home assisted living scenarios.},

In this paper, based on the field study of game for elderly - Chinese Water Painting - we propose a curious companion for the elderly. The curious mechanism of the artificial companion is developed based on Berlyne's model of curiosity. The implementation considers three needs of the elderly: the smoothness of game playing, the entertainment, and the caring for the elderly. A preliminary study suggests a wide range acceptance of the curious companion.},

While stand-alone computer security and database security courses are offered in college-level computer science degree programs, these courses do not reach all computing majors and are often available only for senior level students. We believe that security should be incorporated into the computing curriculum at every level, including high school computing courses. In this paper we show how to extend the widely popular high school-level Oracle Academy program with security concepts. The proposed curriculum extensions require minimal changes to the current curriculum while introducing students to the security threats in database systems. We provide example database laboratory materials that can be included in a high school database or computer science course. We show that security concepts can be presented to the students even at this early stage of their education. We propose age and education-level appropriate methods, such as computer gaming and social interaction, to deliver the security relevant course modules. We also argue that it is imperative to educate high school teachers on database security topics to ensure satisfactory delivery of the security components.},

 abstract = {Orange Technology, a concept that originated in Taiwan, sets the goal to bring more happiness and promote mental wellness for the elderly. This study adopted a virtual orchid planting game symbolizing Orange Technology for a case study through explorative panel discussion followed by focus group interviews which separately included elderly and middle-aged people. This study aimed to find key factors influencing the development of Orange Technology Game (OTG) by introducing technology acceptance model (TAM) analysis. The results show that providing more recreational experiences (RE) and enhancing game induced self-efficacy (GISE) are two key factors, in which, memory improvement, social contact and self-learning are identified for RE, and perceived enjoyment, emotional stability and knowledge exchange are identified for GISE. Moreover, a hypothesis for seniors' TAM is proposed as that GISE will mediate RE to influence seniors' happiness & mental wellness along three identified dimensions of “mental health care”, “social relationships” and “leisure satisfaction”. In addition, middle-aged people showed more enthusiasm than elderly people for each dimension, such that Orange Technology game should shed light on these key factors to fulfill the needs of elder care.},

Wearable wireless low-cost commercial transceivers operating at 2.4 GHz are supposed to be widely deployed in indoor settings and on people's bodies in tomorrow's pervasive computing environments. The key idea of this study is to leverage their presence by collecting the received signal strength (RSS) measured among fixed devices, deployed in the environment, and the wearable one. The RSS measurements are used to classify a set of user's positions in the bed, monitoring the activities of patients unable to make the desirable bodily movements. The collected data are classified using both support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor methods, in order to recognize the different user's position, and thus supporting the bedsores issue.},

 abstract = {A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.},

The proposed game employs hand buttons and footboards based on a PC as controllers. The game is intended to provide the elderly with physical satisfaction through cooperation and competition, entertainment such as vital power, and opportunities to maintain mental functions through games. To test the efficacy of the game, we considered a sample of 309 elderly individuals who were more than 65 years old and resided in Cheonan City. The results indicated that 76.1% of the participants were fully satisfied with the game, rating it 4.13 out of 5. In addition, 89.4% were willing to play the game again. These results suggest that the intended permissiveness and coenesthesia of the game may be appealing to the elderly.},

Prior research has shown an accelerated need for the expansion in the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) domain and to that end we present a novel learning technique for intelligent agents that are embedded in Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs). A novel agent that combines an emotion recognition system with a fuzzy logic based learning and adaptation technique provides for an automated self-learning system that constantly adapts to individual requirements. This agent, entitled Health Adaptive Emotion Fuzzy Agent (HAOEFA), has the ability to model and learn the user behaviour in order to control the environment on their behalf with respect to his/her emotional preferences. In addition, the agent incorporates temporal adaption in order to facilitate changing behaviour and preferences within the environment. The results show that such architecture can both provide monitoring and ambient environmental control features such that users with limited physical or cognitive functions can have their well-being advanced with limited external resources.},

Shape descriptors such as bounding box information and image moments were extracted from silhouettes of the depth images. The features were then clustered using Possibilistic C Means for resident identification. This technology will allow researchers and health professionals to gather more information on the individual residents by filtering out data belonging to non-residents. Gait related information belonging exclusively to the older residents can then be gathered.

 abstract = {With the rising age of the population, there is increased need to help elderly maintain their independence. Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

 abstract = {Modern buildings are equipped with multiple systems, which are dedicated to improve quality of living for inhabitants and to facilitate performance of daily duties for maintenance personnel. Yet the variety of the systems causes the bulky informational flow, which may result informational tense to the user, time lost and increase of errors. To make life comfortable in a smart house, the inhabitants of the building should have an access to the simple and intuitive control and monitoring of the apartment, and the maintenance personnel should have a handily informational support for the prioritizing and efficient performance of the maintenance tasks. Thus, there is a need in intelligent management of information flow to provide data to the users with regards to the context like for instance on-going situation and goals, user's intentions, state and role in the system. This paper proposes framework of context-aware middleware as a solution for information management in the system. Context-awareness is achieved with ontological knowledge models of the system and two-level reasoning upon the ontologies. The enabled technologies are discussed with relation to the use case, which is a combination of smart home and elderly care services. Future steps towards framework realization end the paper.},

Domestic accidents are unpredictable emergent situations, yet the constant care of elderly person by non-relatives or caregivers is difficult due to associated labor costs, privacy problems, and burdens placed on elderly persons themselves. This paper targets trip and fall, the leading cause of accidental death in elderly persons, and examines a detection method for such accidents. To address privacy issues, we use a Doppler sensor that can detect movement without the use of personally identifying data. We also investigate the movement detection and identification by frequency analysis of sensor output using fast Fourier transform. In addition, we design and implement a prototype terminal to detect trip and fall by using a Doppler sensor and an embedded computer.},

As an example, we considered some basic step sequences in the popular dance game (e.g., dance dance revolution), and could detect these movements with a reasonably high probability. We envision that the experimental results presented in this paper will motivate future research in the world of mobile gaming applications using advanced smart phones with a dual module design. It is remarked that the same technology may be used to help the elderly stay at home. This technology can be applied to track and monitor the movements of elderly people to guarantee they are getting up, to detect falls, or to monitor electric wheel chairs so that they may go outside alone thereby assisting the elderly while they live independently in their own homes where they feel safe.},

This tool focuses on therapeutic aspects of both cognitive and physical stimulation of the elderly, that is, it improves the memory by performing mental activities and physical exercise at the same time. To achieve this, a Kinect based Windows application has been developed intended specifically to improve the language area of the brain function. While performing mental activities the user must resolve them by doing various physical motions. KiMentia uses skeletal tracking to capture the body movements, enabling users to control and interact with the computer without any intermediary controller. Furthermore, all the data generated during the session is stored in order to log every rehabilitation activity. Preliminary tests have shown an increase in the users' motivation while using the tool forgetting that it focuses on the cognitive stimulation. In a future research, the results from a long period study will be reported describing the cognitive performance of the patients.},

However, most existing smart wheelchairs have limitations on extensibility and flexibility of building new functionalities. One big reason is they are just stand-alone ones considering other wheelchairs and surrounding things as dummy objects. To address this issue, we proposed an integrated and collaborative approach: Smarter Wheelchairs that can “talk” to each other, and even “talk” to other things in the surrounding. Smarter Wheelchairs take advantages of smart objects deployed in living environment or hospital environment. Smarter Wheelchairs can harness functions provided by smart objects, therefore, their functionality can be flexibly extended. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype system of Smarter Wheelchairs to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.},

To this end, systems and services are required which are user-centric and adaptable towards the needs and capabilities of the people in need of care. The continuous integration of leading-edge technologies, such as cloud and wireless communication technologies, in the context of the Internet of the Things (IoT), can meet this requirement by enabling a new form of communication between frail and elderly people, their environment and relevant groups of care givers. However, for IoT-based systems to reach their full potential, sound answers need to be provided to the important security questions arisen, particularly those regarding authentication of entities (people and environmental objects) and data privacy.

 abstract = {Walking is a popular recreation activity. In addition, it is a mild and healthy exercise for the elderly. However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. The development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a main topic of this paper. We discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. In the previous report, we developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. In this paper, we propose a new structure to control a frictional resistance force that is generated on the surface of the MSE and a metal pin. In addition, we propose to use this device as a single unit for the haptic device on feet. According to the compressive test of the unit, the maximum force that can be controlled with the unit is insufficient yet. However, it appears that we can control frictional force with the proposed structure. We also conducted a simulation to estimate required values of the performance for the unit. It is much higher than the current state of the unit. We have to improve the performance of the unit in the future.},

The research aims to design human robot interaction towards automated medication support for older people [3], [4]. In the current design, the older people are guided by a Stationary Robotic Medication Management System (StRoMMS) while they take their daily medications in their independent living quarters in a retirement village. We performed a pilot user study to evaluate the hypothesized technological requirements of the robotic system as well as the clinical workflow requirements [1] taking into account the health care context. The demonstration shows a snapshot of the interaction for the main medication dialog that the older person undergoes. There are multiple interactions in a day for multiple types of medication scheduled at multiple times. We also show some features of the workflow that ensure any errors are reported in real-time, as well as a feature that ensures the medication regime can be monitored by the health care providers remotely [2] in real-time. The robot also has capabilities to engage the older people by singing and dancing with entertainment content they prefer. Qualitative results from the research is presented in the video and informed a bigger field trial in New Zealand.},

 abstract = {With more and more elders in most countries, the health and safety issues become the primary concern for elderly people because ageing is often associated with physical and cognitive impairments. In order to provide intelligent assistive services for elders, in this paper, we propose an integrated service platform that can accommodate safety assurance, daily activity assistance, and health support services. Specifically, the platform takes care of anomalous events detection, daily activities tracking, and health status monitoring leveraging stationary sensors deployed in living environments and mobile sensing artifacts carried by elders. The services in this integrated platform can ensure safety and independency of elders, they can also help them sustain and/or improve health condition with personalized health support. Based on the proposed platform, we present a case study of assistive safety assurance service wandering detection, which monitors an elder's outdoor movements by using GPS sensor embedded in smart phone and recognizes the lapping or pacing movement pattern to find potential wandering behavior. The experimental results show that our method works well in detecting wandering behavior in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate.},

We introduced the NAO robot to assist in geriatric physiotherapy rehabilitation. The NAO is introduced in order to take over one of the usual roles of the physiotherapist: modeling movements for the inpatients. We also introduced a virtual version of the NAO in order to see whether this role of modeling is equally effective in a screen-based modality. Preliminary results show the inpatients adjust their movements to the NAO, although they react differently to the virtual and the physical robot.},

In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring with on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, an intelligent medication management system is proposed based on intelligent package and ubiquitous sensing technologies. Preventive medication management is enabled by an intelligent package sealed by Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by RFID link. Various vital parameters are collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the short range wireless link. Onsite diagnosis and prognosis based on these health parameters are supported by the scalable architecture. Additionally, friendly human-machine interface is emphasized to make it convenient for the elderly or disabled patients. A prototype system including the hardware, embedded software, user interface, database and some intelligent packages is implemented to verify the concepts.},

 abstract = {Walking and traveling are popular recreation activities for the elderly in Japan. These activities are also mild exercises and have good effects for their health. However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. Especially, development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a new challenge. In this paper, we discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. We developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. According to the experimental results on a dot-type braille block, a target level of the maximum plantar pressure was clarified. On the basis of these results, we designed a unit for the haptic device on feet.},

 abstract = {In advanced countries throughout the world, the population of Alzheimer's Disease(AD) patients has been gradually increasing with the aging of the society. As a result, it has become an important research topic how to diagnose AD early and give necessary treatment and training to AD patients, especially those with mild cognitive impairment(MCI), whose executive functions such as response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, attention switching and planning may display evident disorder and impairment. Unlike traditional paper tests and subjective assessments by the patient's relatives, this study adopts virtual reality(VR) technology to develop a novel diagnosis & assessment system, which uses head mounted display(HMD), game technology and sensors to generate an interactive and panoramic scenario-a virtual convenience store-for assessment of executive functions and memory. A variety of tasks of multi-layered difficulty-level hierarchy, such as memorizing a shopping list, looking for certain goods, and checking out, has been designed for customized and adaptive assessment, training, and treatment of MD. In the meantime, the study also records test-takers' performance data (including path and central-vision movement) in the process of all tasks for the development of a novel diagnosis & assessment method. Moreover, test-takers' technology acceptance is measured for assessing the elderly's subjective perception of new technology and discussing the topic of human-machine interaction. In the study, tests on 2 healthy adults have been completed, the system's functionality has been preliminarily verified, and test-takers' subjective perception of the system has been investigated.},

 abstract = {Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous opportunities for the implementation of ubiquitous health care systems in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against abnormal conditions. This helps with the automatic and remote monitoring/tracking of patients in hospitals and facilitates and with the supervision of fragile, elderly people in their own domestic environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug delivery. This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for the multipatient positioning in a wireless body area network (WBAN) which exploits the spatial sparsity of patients and a sparse fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based feature extraction mechanism for monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a central database server containing patient vital information. The main goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and resolution in the patient localization with less computational complexity in the implementation using the compressive sensing theory. We represent the patients' positions as a sparse vector obtained by the discrete segmentation of the patient movement space in a circular grid. To estimate this vector, a compressive-sampling-based two-level FFT (CS-2FFT) feature vector is synthesized for each received signal from the biosensors embedded on the patient's body at each grid point. This feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both short-time and long-time properties of the received signals. The robustness of the proposed CS-2FFT-based algorithm in terms of the average positioning error is numerically evaluated using the realistic parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6-WBAN standard in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the circular grid pattern and the CS-2FFT feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a significant reduction in the computational complexity, while improving the level of the resolut- on and the localization accuracy when compared to some classical CS-based positioning algorithms.},

The results show that knowledge learning and social interaction have positive effects on both self-efficacy and hedonic experience, self-efficacy also has a positive effect on hedonic experience, and hedonic experience will have a direct impact on behavior intention to use OTG system.

The system is a technological solution based on external aid at a practical level (substitution-based rehabilitation). In particular, we propose a model focused on points of interest or well-known places, in which user-friendly routes to a destination are generated based on the user context rather than the conventional street names and quantitative distances. Moreover, the system offers augmented reality views that include contextual information. This philosophy of navigation more closely matches the needs of the user than do conventional navigation systems; the proposal is especially useful for users who are not accustomed to using new technologies (e.g., elderly people), people experiencing disorientation and, more generally, individuals with a slight cognitive deficit. The system also includes an application that allows the relatives of the user to establish tasks that must be performed at a specific location and to monitor the activities of the user to detect potentially risky situations.},

Ultimately, we aim to expand the social participation of the elderly in both online communication and online work such as crowdsourcing. We report the results of a two-week user study on the crowdsourcing of participants' experience and knowledge through online communication, and analyze the information obtained to evaluate the efficiency of this interaction model by extracting features of each participant's knowledge and experience via the proposed method.},

Unfortunately, most seniors are prone to deteriorating health, which may result in mental or physical impairment. Therefore, research in senile diseases will definitely become active. This study puts emphasis on the prophylaxis of elderly health care, especially the cognition related issues. Several systems, including visual, audio, and memory tests, are designed on Tablet PC for elderly to self evaluate their health status. The advantages of the proposed systems lie in providing the elderly handy tools to perform the evaluation without going back and forth to the hospital, receive the test results immediately, and retrieve the records anytime at home. The results from the proposed systems are compared with other methods to verify their effectiveness and practicality in early evaluation of senile dementia.},

 abstract = {Health professionals, nursing and care staff are in short supply to cater to all the needs of the growing, global elderly population. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low cost and low power context aware robotic system to assist the elderly due to a desire to develop accessible technology for all countries and considering the poverty of many elderly. The system is furnished with 4 wheels for indoor navigation. It is equipped with 'environmental parameter monitoring' sensors and the system can be controlled by the user through voice commands. The system interprets the environmental contexts and makes context aware decisions based on the sensed information. On the basis of the previous medical history from the database server and the newly interpreted data, the decision making unit makes efficient decisions and gives feedback to the device control unit. The system improves the health of the elderly by regularly monitoring the environmental conditions of people.},

 abstract = {A methodology for mapping in-home gait speed (IGS), measured unobtrusively and continuously in the homes of older adults, to Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) time is presented. A Kinect-based gait system was used to collect in-home gait data on 15 older adults over time periods of up to 16 months. Concurrently, the participants completed a monthly clinician administered fall risk assessment protocol that included TUG and habitual gait speed (HGS) tests. A theoretical analysis of expected performance is presented, and the performance of the IGS-based TUG estimates is compared against that of estimates based on HGS measured at the same time as the TUG. Results indicate that the IGS-based estimates are as accurate as the HGS-based estimates as compared to the observed TUG times. After filtering the TUG times to reduce noise, the IGS-based estimates are more accurate. The mapping of in-home sensor data to well studied domains facilitates clinical interpretation of the in-home data.},

We are specifically interested in "service tailoring" for the homecare domain, where healthcare professionals (care-givers) do the tailoring of services to support elderly (care-receivers). Our goal is that, using our approach, care-givers can create or modify services with less IT skills, time and/or effort, and care-receivers get services that are better suited for their specific and personal needs. As a proof of concept, we developed a software prototype of our approach. The prototype was subsequently used in a real-world field test at a care institution in the Netherlands to validate the approach. The validation focused on the usability aspects of the approach in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, learnability and satisfaction. This paper describes the design of the field test and reflects on the outcome of the validation experiments.},

We developed a new game concept, Dual-Task Tai Chi (DTTC), using Kinect (Microsoft Co.), a motion-capture device, and demonstrated that the DTTC test can quantitatively evaluate various functions that are known risk factors for falling in elderly adults. Moreover, DT training has been attracting attention as a way to improve balance and DT ability. However, only a few studies have reported that it improves cognitive performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether or not a 12-week program of DTTC training would effectively improve cognitive functions. A total of 41 elderly individuals (training group: n = 26, control group: n = 15) participated in this study and their cognitive functions were assessed before and after DTTC training. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with significant group x time interactions for the executive cognitive function measure: t:. trail-making test (part Bpart A) (p <; 0.05). The results suggest that DTTC training is effective for improving executive cognitive functions.},

Telehealth has been widely promoted as a technology to make healthcare more effective and affordable. However, current telehealth systems suffer from vendor lock-in and high cost, and are designed for managing chronic diseases, rather than preventing them. In this paper we evaluate technologies for supporting senior health consumers. Based on this we propose a framework for a novel telehealth system overcoming many of the shortcomings of existing technologies. The new system is web-based, has a Facebook-like plug-in architecture for adding new health applications, and incorporates social networking functionalities. We discuss the challenges in implementing the system, and summarize a user study evaluating the system. Our results demonstrate that health consumers have a positive view of this new telehealth technology, and that it can positively change the attitude of users towards their health.},

Considering these key features leads to a system design suitable for majority of human surveillance purposes including home care, hospices, rehabilitation and sport training.

 abstract = {Social networks connect people while internet of things platforms connect things. Although both platforms use various communication tools in efficient ways, platforms for things often don't communicate and interoperate with social networks. As a consequence, there is a lack of unified programming interfaces and platforms to enable internet-based interactions between people and things. This hinders deployment of services where people and things need to co-exist such as in ambient assisted living and collaborative sensing scenarios. We propose activity feeds as a unified communication framework to address this integration challenge. The activity feed concept is widely deployed in social networks and recently also in internet of things platforms. It is a flexible and easy-to-understand concept. We propose a communication framework based on activity feeds consisting of a set of concepts, a set of patterns for using activity feeds, an API for developing applications, and a reference implementation of the framework on smart phones. We describe how we tested this framework in two different applications in the areas of ambient assisted living and crisis management. For these two applications we were able to easily deploy the framework by invoking the activity feed API. We report on how we use communication patterns based on activity feeds and how the framework managed to facilitate people and thing communication.},

Our conclusions are that elderly people have poor performance in operating social networking software, Chinese type-in and browsing the worldwide web site, because of their less usage experiences. Next, when Elderly people are using transform-Pad, they have better performance on game software than on social networking software, Chinese type-in and browsing the website.},

Monitoring of the elderlies and physically impaired, sports medicine, and physical therapy, are some of the active research areas in telerehabilition. Furthermore, the gaming industry has provided some low-cost devices to track motion with reasonable accuracy, thus, making telerehabilition a reality for patients who need it. This project investigates the feasibility of using the Nintindo Wii Remote Controller as a handheld device that patients can use to perform repetitive motions in physical therapy sessions in a telerehabilitation setting. Patients can use such an instructional (or e-learning) system at home without the cost, effort, and time associated with visiting a medical office. At the same time, the public health care system also benefits from the deployment of these telerehabilitation systems.},

In this framework, the IMMED project investigates tele-monitoring technologies to support doctors in the diagnostic and follow-up of dementia illnesses such as Alzheimer. Specifically, water sounds are very useful to track and identify abnormal behaviors form everyday activities (e.g. hygiene, household, cooking, etc.). In this work, we propose a double-stage system to detect this type of sound events. In the first stage, the audio stream is segmented with a simple but effective algorithm based on the Spectral Cover feature. The second stage improves the system precision by classifying the segmented streams into water/non-water sound events using Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients and Support Vector Machines. Experimental results reveal the potential of the combined system, yielding a F-measure higher than 80%.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to clarify the relation among the viscosity values of semi-solid diets and the electrical mechanism of gastric motility. Firstly, a measurement procedure suitable for stomach physiology was proposed. A new measurement procedure lessened the psychological and physiological burdens of the subjects, and controlled the cycle of gastric activity of the subjects. And the dispersion of data for subjects was decreased by this new method, in which the measurements were started after 4 hours fasting. Secondly, we prepared five grades of viscosities of fluid to semi-solid diets from low to high viscosity (30 mPa·s ~ 20000 mPa·s) mixed by five different amounts of two kinds of thickening agents. The measurements were performed for 8 healthy volunteer subjects. By evaluating DPr (Dominant Power ratio: Ratio of post/pre-prandial DP values), a significant increment by ingestion of high viscosity semi-solid diets was confirmed in both kinds of thickening agents. DFD (Dominant Frequency Dispersion) was significantly decreased in both high viscosity semi-solid diets. Thus, these results suggested that gastric activity was physiologically stimulated and the cycle of gastric activity became stable by ingestion of high viscosity diets. The results showed that an electrophysiological phenomenon in the evaluation of electrogastrography (EGG) is affected by the viscosity of diets, and also suggested that the difference in the shear rate dependence of diets was not really significant to the electrical behavior of gastric motility.},

Quantification of drusen size and total area covered by drusen is an important risk factor for progression. In this paper, we propose a method to detect drusen and quantify drusen size along with the area covered with drusen in macular region from standard color retinal images. We used combined local intensity distribution, adaptive intensity thresholding and edge information to detect potential drusen areas. The proposed method detected the presence of any drusen with 100% accuracy (50/50 images). For drusen detection accuracy (DDA), the segmentations produced by the automated method on individual images achieved mean sensitivity and specificity values of 74.94% and 81.17%, respectively.},

These factors contribute to balance difficulties that eventually lead to falls. The injuries due to falls, at this age, are risky, since most of the times may cause a significant - and permanent - decrease of quality of life or, in extreme cases, death. In this context, a fall detection system can bring an added value to assist elderly people. This paper describes a system consisting of a wearable sensor unit, a smartphone and a website. When the sensor detects a fall it sends an alert using the smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0, to notify the family members or stakeholders. The sensor device includes an inertial unit, a barometer, and a temperature and humidity sensor. The website displays the log of previous falls and enables the configuration of emergency contact numbers. The proposed fall detection system is one of multiple components within a larger project under development that offers a holistic perspective on falls; the complete wearable solution will also feature, among others, physical protection (minimizing the impact of falls that occur).},

To address such need, a lot of attention have been given from various perspectives such as health monitoring, medication adherence, body-sensor network, smart home for elderly and disabled and so on. However, very less focus has been directed to address the entertainment needs of the elderly, which is an important aspect for an enjoyable living. This paper proposes the design of a context-aware elderly entertainment support system (CAEESS) by investigating the entertainment requirements based on the perspectives of elderly and caregiver. Our focus is on the technical platform to fulfill the identified requirements. The proposed system facilitates the elderly to access various entertainment services through different modes of interaction and also empowers the caregiver to select entertainment media or resources for the elderly when needed. We believe that the proposed approach will provide a clear understanding of the requirements of CAEESS and enable us to effectively address the problems related to the independent and happy living of the elderly.},

Within the European FP7 project “CompanionAble” (2008-2012) [1], we developed assistive technologies combining a mobile robot and smart environment with the aim to support these people and assist them living in their familiar home environment. For a final evaluation, user experience studies were conducted with volunteer users who were invited to a test home where they lived and freely used the robot and integrated system over a period of two days. Services provided by the companion robot include reminders of appointments (pre-defined or added by the users themselves or their informal carer) as well as frequent recommendations to specific activities, which were listed e.g. by their family carers. Furthermore, video contact with relatives and friends, a cognitive stimulation game designed especially to counter the progress of cognitive impairments, and the possibility to store personal items with the robot are offered. Recognition of the user entering or leaving the home is triggering situation specific reminders like agenda items due during the (expected) absence, missed calls or items not to be forgotten. Continuing our previous work published in [2], this paper presents detailed description of the implemented assistive functions and results of user studies conducted during April and May 2012 in the smart house of the Dutch project partner Smart Homes in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.},

Moreover, if isolation is coupled with physical illness and incapacitation, such a risk increases exponentially. To fight back this problem, roboticists have been proposing solutions to autonomously monitor, support and even promote physical activities among the elderly. Nevertheless, those appear as very high-cost and complex solutions that require an advanced technical expertise. Recent off-the-shelf solutions, such as the well-known NAO robot, emerged as possible alternatives. An extension to the NAO robot, denoted as RIA, is being developed at the Engineering Institute of Coimbra (ISEC). The RIA is not only built for a social interaction with the elderly but also as an autonomous tool to promote professional care through the analysis of health and environmental parameters. Therefore, the RIA robot is an adapted NAO low-cost platform equipped with several sensors that can measure different parameters like body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. By validating this valuable platform, the foundations were laid for a whole new paradigm in elderly care.},

The administrations in affected areas are looking for a new urban development consideration of such disasters. However, the concept visions of the reconstruction plan in the affected areas have been proposed, a concrete action plan is not clearly shown for each stages. As a new urban development, a smart community concept has been proposed in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) before the earthquake. That concept aims an integrated and optimized community society with a variety of social services such as an energy, transportation, and logistics system. Currently, many problems for living in temporary houses have occurred. Particularly, the disuse syndrome in the elderly in temporary housing is serious. The many elderly have lost connection with outside community, because of moving to the temporary housing. And then they become withdrawal condition. Finally, they become bedridden by decline in physical function. These problems are common problem in future aging society in Japan. In this paper, the support model for a living on temporary houses in the disaster area is mentioned. The model become to a test bed model based on smart community toward future aging society.},

To support such unsupervised care activities, an increasingly number of reminders and monitoring systems are designed. However, most of these systems target a specific treatment or a specific condition. In this paper, we discuss experiences from designing the tablet-based application MediFrame. MediFrame is a personal medication management system to support older adults in non-clinical settings such as the home. The paper describes the user-centered design process and the resulting tablet application. We show how MediFrame can be used to support adherence in medical treatments through fieldwork informed use scenarios. Based on early qualitative feedback, we also discuss lessons learned and how designers can support a holistic medication experience for an older adult's everyday life.},

 abstract = {Automatically estimating a person's energy expenditure has numerous uses, including ensuring sufficient daily activity by an elderly live-alone person, such activity shown to have numerous benefits. Most previous work requires a person to wear a sensor device. We introduce a video-based activity level estimation technique to take advantage of increasingly-common in-home camera systems. We consider several features of a motion bounding rectangle for such estimation, including changes in height and width, and vertical and horizontal velocities and accelerations. Experiments involved 36 recordings of normal household activity, such as reading while seated, sweeping, and light exercising, involving 4 different actors. Results show, somewhat surprisingly, that the feature horizontal acceleration leads to an activity level estimation fidelity of 0.994 correlation with a commercial BodyBugg body-worn energy measurement device. Furthermore, the approach yielded 90.9% average accuracy of energy expenditure.},

 abstract = {Elders who live alone are vulnerable population at risk. Despite telemedicine and clinical home monitoring are effective to provide health care, accidents at home are still one of the major risk factors. Important efforts have been done in home monitoring systems to detect potential scenarios of risk. However, the complex technological interaction has a negative impact on the user and intrusive or wearable devices are not recommended. Sensorized houses solve this problem, recording the behaviour of elders at home without a direct interaction. However, the detection of health-risk scenarios is a complex issue, since the large amount temporal data registered by sensors must be correctly interpreted. In such a case, Artificial Intelligence techniques have been used to automatically identify abnormal behaviors. Due to the number false positives of these techniques, the human intervention is still necessary. We consider that a semiautomatic approach, abstracting and visualizing the recorded temporal information, is a more suitable approach. In this work, we propose a specialised visualization model that helps system supervisors to identify through visual mining techniques most common scenarios of risk. We illustrate our proposal in a specific home monitoring system.},

 abstract = {The changing demographic profile of the population has potentially challenging social, geopolitical, and financial consequences for individuals, families, the wider society, and governments globally. The demographic change will result in a rapidly growing elderly population with healthcare implications which importantly include Alzheimer type conditions (a leading cause of dementia). Dementia requires long term care to manage the negative behavioral symptoms which are primarily exhibited in terms of agitation and aggression as the condition develops. This paper considers the nature of dementia along with the issues and challenges implicit in its management. The Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are introduced with factors (precursors) to the onset of agitation and aggression. Independent living is considered, health monitoring and implementation in context-aware decision-support systems is discussed with consideration of data analytics. Implicit in health monitoring are technical and ethical constraints, we briefly consider these constraints with the ability to generalize to a range of medical conditions. We postulate that health monitoring offers exciting potential opportunities however the challenges lie in the effective realization of independent assisted living while meeting the ethical challenges, achieving this remains an open research question remains.},

 abstract = {The Agile Software Development (ASD) process is at the forefront of rapid product development driven by changing customer requirements and a trusted, self-organizing development team. Scrum has become a viable model of ASD focusing on determining immediate deliverables and structuring short timelines, called Sprints, for designing, implementing, and providing them for testing by the customer. While these practices are being adopted by organizations, there is significant difficulty in scaling them to the classroom. Once in place, it is a complex task to evaluate individual student performance based solely on the product outcome and Sprint grade. Thus, there is limited opportunity to catch performance problems that may lead to missing deliverable deadlines or decreasing team trust. In this paper, we impose ASD using Scrum on a senior software projects course in Computer Science. Using a collaborative environment that embeds a social network, project management modules, and event capture system, we perform broad data and event capture and analysis to investigate metrics that are relevant to assessing individual performance aspects related to functioning on an Agile team for software development. Our results suggest that predictive data is available after each Sprint to ascertain individual performance attributes and their relationship to product outcomes.},

For a real caring society, the notion of "information sharing" becomes clearly crucial when communication and interaction in health care is needed. This paper revisits recent funded projects undertaken by our team, in view of the so-called coordination of planned activities for elderly/disabled care and independent living support. Three development pillars are taken under consideration herein, namely, affective exergaming services for seniors/disabled, social media and the semantic web. Outputs from a multitude of projects are then used to provide evidence of how issues recently encountered under the so-called blue line dimensions are tackled; these are technological interoperability, semantic integration, modern interfaces, people needs/expectations and societal incentives. As the latter synthesize a con-temporary puzzle of personalised health care approach, this paper provides an innovative perspective of interlinking developments and outputs of research in view of improving healthcare.},

This demographic trend will be also followed by an increase of people with physical limitations. New challenges are being raised to the traditional health care systems, not only in Portugal, but also in all other European states. There is an urgent need to find solutions that allow extending the time people can live in their preferred environment by increasing their autonomy, self-confidence and mobility. AAL4ALL is a project currently being developed in cooperation with 34 Portuguese interdisciplinary partners, from industry to academia, R&D and social disciplines, which employs a novel conceptual approach through the development of an ecosystem of products and services for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) associated to a business model and validated through large scale trial. This paper presents a comparative perspective of the needs and attitudes towards technology of the AAL users and caregivers identified in the analysis of a set of three different surveys: a users survey targeted at the Portuguese seniors and pre-seniors; an informal caregivers survey targeted at the family, friends and neighbours who provide care without any financial compensation; and a formal caregivers survey targeted at physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and direct-care workers providing care to elders. The first results indicate that AAL solutions must be affordable, user friendly and have a true perceived benefit to their users.},

 abstract = {The main objective of this project was to evaluate the sensing system for person detection in the scope of its integration in a mobile robotic platform for Ambient Assisted Living. Two sensors were considered, a camera and a depth sensor. For the camera (2D), 3 different algorithms were implemented: face detection, tracking and recognition. For the depth sensor the whole body detection was tested using skeleton tracking. The results showed that the face detection and recognition algorithms had a very small range, and the face tracking demonstrated to reach a higher distance. However, the latter exhibited poor results when confronted with illumination variations. The skeleton tracking algorithm provided good results, being capable of tracking relatively close to the sensor and up to 3 meters distance. Thus, the 2D face recognition can be used for short distances to identify the person, while the 3D skeleton tracking can be appropriated for distant tracking of the person. This work showed that the integration of these sensing systems, in a robotic platform, can make a robust robot capable of human interaction in home environments.},

 abstract = {The increasing number of elderly citizens in our society increases the strain on traditional healthcare systems' resources. Ambient Assisted Living solutions seek to reduce the impact of this trend as well as provide a way for the elderly to continue living in their home environment as long as possible with a good quality of life and independence. However, due to the diverse nature of existing products and services, ensuring interoperability between them is important to provide flexible and adequate solutions for an individual's particular needs. The goal of this work is to propose a solution for this problem using Electronic Health Records and health information standards. For this purpose, a repository was implemented to store records in Extensible Markup Language format following the openEHR standard, as well as an application to create, manage and query these records. An interface engine was used to provide message transformation capabilities between different standards and openEHR. The results gathered from an evaluation of this work show that such a system provides fast insertion of information and reasonable querying times for single records. Also, the message transformation capabilities developed in conjunction with the storage mechanism provide an important step towards solving the interoperability problem.},

Currently, this is a well-known problem and therefore multiple ICT-based solutions for falls management exist. In addition, a small part of them are said to help preventing falls, but most of the reviewed solutions doesn't seem to have their focus in reducing specific fall risk factors like loss of muscle mass or a poor balance. The proposed ICT-based fall prevention solution is based on an existing fall prevention exercise programme specifically designed for the Portuguese population. It takes advantage of the smartphone processing capabilities as well as its built-in inertial sensors to evaluate the movements performed during the execution of specific exercises. Using only a simple smartphone it is possible to provide a friendly and inexpensive solution capable of increasing seniors' adherence to fall prevention exercises as well as raise their motivation to properly execute the exercises in their home environment.},

This paper presents an automatic danger detecting and alerting tool for elderly or patients living alone, called We Care. It contains an easily wearable Badge and a Service Center. A cheap and energy efficient accelerometer is added to the Badge detecting 1) the falling down event, 2) the unexpected movement and motionlessness events and 3) the going out and going back home events. A GSM module is integrated to communicate with the Service Center and alerts their family members or doctors when the above events happened. By accessing the Service Center's website, the user can configure his Badge remotely.

Based on this we develop a smartphone-based golf game, which uses GPS and accelerometer sensors for collecting monitoring data and motivating patients to get active. The physical simulation uses an experimentally derived formula to convert wrist accelerometer data into driving distance.

 abstract = {An increasing number of the elderly population wish to live an independent lifestyle, rather than rely on intrusive care programmes. A big data solution is presented using wearable sensors capable of carrying out continuous monitoring of the elderly, alerting the relevant caregivers when necessary and forwarding pertinent information to a big data system for analysis. A challenge for such a solution is the development of context-awareness through the multidimensional, dynamic and nonlinear sensor readings that have a weak correlation with observable human behaviours and health conditions. To address this challenge, a wearable sensor system with an intelligent data forwarder is discussed in this paper. The forwarder adopts a Hidden Markov Model for human behaviour recognition. Locality sensitive hashing is proposed as an efficient mechanism to learn sensor patterns. A prototype solution is implemented to monitor health conditions of dispersed users. It is shown that the intelligent forwarders can provide the remote sensors with context-awareness. They transmit only important information to the big data server for analytics when certain behaviours happen and avoid overwhelming communication and data storage. The system functions unobtrusively, whilst giving the users peace of mind in the knowledge that their safety is being monitored and analysed.},

This paper proposes a measurement-focused study oriented to evaluate a new methodology for assessing fall risk using low-cost and off-the-shelf devices. The proposed methodology consists of a data acquisition system, a data analysis system, and a fall risk assessment system. The data acquisition system is composed by a standard notebook computer and video game input devices: a Kinect, a Wii balance board, and two Wii motion controllers. The data analysis system and the fall risk assessment system, in turn, use signal processing, data mining, and computational intelligence methods, in order to analyze the acquired data for determining the fall risk of the subject under analysis. This methodology includes six static and two dynamic tests. Experiments were conducted on a population of 37 subjects: 16 with falling background, and 21 with nonfalling background. These two groups have the same age distribution. As nonlinear binary classification techniques were used, methodologies based on confidence intervals are not applicable and then tenfold cross validation was used to estimate accuracy. Hence, such a methodology can classify the fall risk as high or low, with an accuracy of 89.2%. The proposed methodology allows the construction of low-cost, portable, replicable, objective, and reliable fall risk assessment systems.},

Against this background, an approach called "preventive care," which aims to prevent increases in the number of persons requiring nursing care, received a lot of attention in recent years. This paper proposes a system for preventive care through game playing with robots. The robots are programmed to behave like humans based on the concept of Human-Agent Interaction. In addition, reinforcement learning is applied to the robots in order to encourage users' competitive spirit and to find an exercise load suitable for each individual user. The proposed system thus allows users to enjoy exercising continuously through match-ups against the robots. With the cooperation of local governments and health and welfare facilities, we investigated the basic characteristics and utility of the proposed system by subjective evaluation targeting the elderly.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of the virtual reality version of the Multiple Errands Test based on NeuroVR software as an assessment tool for executive functions. In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 10), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline.},

This study investigates the use and contribution of wrist-worn multisensors for activity recognition. We found that accelerometers are the most important sensors and heart rate data can be used to boost classification of activities with diverse heart rates. We propose a genetic algorithm-based fusion weight selection (GAFW) approach which utilizes GA to find fusion weights. For all possible classifier combinations and fusion methods, the study shows that 98% of times GAFW can achieve equal or higher accuracy than the best classifier within the group.},

In this paper we propose a generic middleware architecture adhering to the standardized EPCglobal architecture for managing integrated ID and sensor data streams from sensor tags.

The framework of the intelligent system consists of monitoring important daily activities through the observation of everyday object usage. The improved wellness indices defined here have helped in reducing false warnings related to the daily activities of elderly living. Time series data processing techniques have been applied to the improved wellness indicators, to take care of the dynamic situation in relation to aging of the elderly and seasonal weather variation. With a minimal number of binary motion sensors, the elderly were tracked in real time to get better information on their physical condition. The developed system was able to recognize 94 percent of the basic daily activities accurately, and at the same time the system was able to assess the wellness activities quantitatively in near real time. The well-being indices of the elderly can be used by the healthcare providers to take preventive measures on deterioration of activities of daily living, and thus consequently reduce cost of healthcare.},

Consequently, the spatial disorientation has become a significant problem for older people and their caregivers. The ambient-assisted living applications are offering location-based services for empowering elderly to go outside and encouraging a greater independence. Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness service enabler aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the service enabler introduced contribute to “context-awareness” paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences.},

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supports ubiquitous healthcare services: in particular, the solution herein proposed focuses on the availability of remote health services at home, designed for independent-living patients and elderly, or people in particular conditions, that may benefit from accessing and managing health services from home. The employment of a friendly and easy-to-use consumer electronic device as the smart TV to interface the system, is chosen to limit costs, to promote its usage and spread, but also to address the usability needs of elderly, and other users not familiar with personal computers, or other portable devices. The paper presents the design and implementation of a solution that offers a set of e-health services. The idea is to create a unique interface towards both a cloud-based remote service for the consultation of medical reports, provided by the regional Public Administration, and a personal local service that allows to collect and display data from biomedical devices, and to manage user's reminders for medicines.},

 abstract = {We have made use of the microbending fiber optic sensor to capture ballistocardiographic signals or data for vital signs monitoring in ambient settings, with applications ranging from serious games to ambient assistive living for ageing at home for the elderly. To remove noise and extract the vital signs, the first step of the signal data processing is filtering the signal. In this paper we consider the properties of the digital filter for filtering ballistocardiographic signals. The vital signs waveforms are derived from raw data captured by optical transducers that are placed in ambient locations that are in contact with, but not worn by the subject. Data has been collected from various locations and positions and a detailed trial has been conducted for one of these positions. We iteratively improve the filter design so as to lead to the best parameters. The baseline filter performed reasonably well on data collected in a trial study, with a mean error rate less than 10% for half of the subjects and below 20% for three quarters of the subjects. We also present results of an improved filter that improves the performance both in terms of responsiveness and sensitivity. The improved filter demonstrates consistently less than 12% mean error rate. Principles gleaned from this study may also be applied in designing filters for other types of sensors and for other applications in healthcare.},

 abstract = {Activity recognition in a home setting is being widely explored as a means to support elderly people living alone. Probabilistic models using classical, maximum-likelihood estimation methods are known to work well in this domain, but they are prone to overfitting and require labeled activity data for every new site. This limitation has important practical implications, because labeling activities is expensive, time-consuming, and intrusive to the monitored person. In this article, the authors use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate the parameters of activity recognition models in a Bayesian framework. They evaluate their approach by comparing it to a state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood method on three publicly available real-world datasets. Their approach achieves significantly better recognition performance (p less than or equal to 0.05).},

Therefore, in this paper we propose a system that monitors the user by combining an ECG sensor and two accelerometers. Our system recognizes the user's activities and detects falls using the accelerometer data. The ECG data is analyzed in order to extract relevant physiological signals: heart rate, respiration rate, etc. In order to improve the reliability and robustness of the system, the measured accelerometer signals can be combined with the ECG signal in order to detect anomalies in the user's behavior and heart-related problems.

 abstract = {Obesity is considered an endemic within the whole European continent, just as in most part of the developed world. Obesity poses an increasing risk, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. To assess the impact of obesity we need to take into account the severity of the problems that obesity might cause, as risk is usually interpreted as the product of probability of occurrence and severity. In the last few decades, increased occurrence of several morbidities was casually linked to obesity. Recently health problems targeting children have increasing trends in well developed countries. Our research is focusing on obesity related health problems in children, and our offered ICT solutions enables healthcare service providers to remotely monitor patient's (children's) activities and weight. The solution also helps to assign workout programs to the children according to the collected sensor data. The used workout programs base not only on widely used sport activities (etc. running or gymnastics), but cover non-conventional sport activities like playing with interactive game consoles at home. The system contains an Android based DAQ (Data Acquisition Device), sensors and a server side portal, which collects all measured patient information in the data center. The solution combines existing; self developed client and server side applications and frameworks, and commodity sensor solutions. The main goal of our work is to adapt the already existing monitoring solution to children. Kids behave and use such monitoring environments differently due to their different perception and knowledge level. They need different GUIs; they live different lifestyle as elderly patients. The communication lines of the system are compliant to the EU and national regulations. The developed system was tested and a prototype system was installed successfully in a real environment. Sensor data acquisition on the personal mobile device - nables both end-users and care givers/professionals to provide better and more effective health monitoring and facilitate patient's treatment.

 abstract = {Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system that affects elderly. There are six main symptoms: tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movements), hand asymmetry, posture instability and freezing of gait. Nowadays any type of diagnose for this disorder is done through observation by a health care professional specialized in this area. Therefore a simpler and more efficient method that General Practioners can use to have some grounded information to decide to forward a possible patient to a specialist is needed. With this in mind different systems were studied coming to the conclusion that a mobile application is among the best options. This work can be split in four important phases (see Figure 1): (1) study of the current market for this problem and for the solution to be developed, (2) development of a smartphone application capable of gathering data of the early symptoms of Parkinson's taking into consideration all the smartphone's specifications; (3) use the application to gather data from real patients and a control group and (4) test and select a classification algorithm. The first phase involved two research topics: problem and solution. The problem consisted in studying all the symptoms that could theoretically be detected by the different smartphone components. The solution consisted in studying the different methods used to solve such a problem using data mining techniques (different feature selection and classification algorithms that best take advantage of the nature of the data gathered). The second phase consisted in the development of the smartphone application with four components (spiral analysis, tap analysis, simple questions and gait analysis). The third phase was dedicated in building the control group gathering data from healthy people and a Parkinson patients group for a total of 35 subjects. Finally, the fourth phase was using the studied algorithms to filter the different features- and compare the different algorithms selected. With the available data from the test subjects it was possible to achieve promising results from the gait analysis of the patients where the pelvic sway was a good feature to help differentiate Parkinson patients from healthy ones.},

The basic core of this environment is based on the idea of Ambient Intelligent (AmI), therefore resulting in a twofold contribution: (i) remote monitoring in an unobtrusive manner by heterogeneous sensors, (ii) early prevention of critical situations and alert propagation of emergency conditions. The designed monitoring system is adaptive and flexible, and it can adjust to changing conditions of inhabitants. Our aim is to develop a systemic life-space solution, allowing the monitoring of basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) behavior of elderly living alone in order to augment their perception of independence and safeness at home.},

Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

 abstract = {Mobile platforms are becoming the predominant medium of access to Internet services due to the tremendous increase in their computation and communication capabilities. However, enabling applications that require real-time in-the-field data collection and processing using mobile platforms is still challenging due to i) the insufficient computing capabilities and unavailability of complete data on individual mobile devices and ii) the prohibitive communication cost and response time involved in offloading data to remote computing resources such as cloud datacenters for centralized computation. A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool-a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)-is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data-and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In orderto address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. A thorough experimental analysis aimed at verifying and demonstrating the benefits brought by autonomic capabilities of the framework is also presented in detail.},

 abstract = {Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is a subjective concept, reflecting the overall mental and physical state of the patient, and their own sense of well-being. Estimating current and future QoL has become a major outcome in the evaluation of critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to enhance the inference process of 6 weeks and 6 months prognosis of QoL after intensive care unit (ICU) stay, using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The main outcomes of the study were the EQ-5D five main dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety depression. For each outcome, three Bayesian classifiers were built and validated with 10-fold cross-validation. Sixty and 473 patients (6 weeks and 6 months, respectively) were included. Overall, 6 months QoL is higher than 6 weeks, with the probability of absence of problems ranging from 31% (6 weeks mobility) to 72% (6 months self-care). Bayesian models achieved prognosis accuracies of 56% (6 months, anxiety depression) up to 80% (6 weeks, mobility). The prognosis inference process for an individual patient was enhanced with the visual analysis of the models, showing that women, elderly, or people with longer ICU stay have higher risk of QoL problems at 6 weeks. Likewise, for the 6 months prognosis, a higher APACHE II severity score also leads to a higher risk of problems, except for anxiety depression where the youngest and active have increased risk. Bayesian networks are competitive with less descriptive strategies, improve the inference process by incorporating domain knowledge and present a more interpretable model. The relationships among different factors extracted by the Bayesian models are in accordance with those collected by previous state-of-the-art literature, hence showing their usability as inference model.},

 abstract = {With the world population aging rapidly, improving the quality of life for senior citizens has become an important societal issue. Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most debilitating neuro-degenerative disorders that seriously affect the seniors' quality of life. In recent years, video games have been shown to be a viable way through which partial rehabilitation for PD can be carried out in a fun and low cost manner. Earlier research has shown that both patients' physical and mental conditions can be improved by playing video games. However, so far, the available games developed for PD are mostly intended for rehabilitation purposes. PD diagnosis still depends on the traditional neurological exams and experience of doctors, which require the patients to become self-aware of the symptoms and are usually too late for the patients to delay the progression of PD. To support the early detection of PD symptoms, we propose a fuzzy logic based PD risk predictor that has been implemented in a tablet game platform. The player's behavior data in the game environment are captured unobtrusively and analyzed in real-time. The player's current risk of developing PD is estimated using the proposed fuzzy logic based approach, which will help the player to be aware of high risk of having PD at an earlier stage. A pilot evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The presented work extends semantic techniques, usually used in large-scale IT systems, for active diagnosis in open embedded real time systems. Open embedded systems (e.g., ambient assisted living for elderly care, critical infrastructures, health management and medical systems) exhibit real-time and reliability requirements, while the constituent components are unknown at design time. Time-triggered diagnostic inference supports the incremental generation of symptoms, which result from the temporal and spatial decomposition of the diagnostic analysis process. The methods and algorithms are prototypically implemented, as well as experimentally evaluated. The paper demonstrates that dynamic semantic web services in combination with time-triggered scheduling techniques are suitable to enable active diagnosis in open embedded systems with reliability and real-time requirements.},

It is capable of providing a technology-driven approach to alleviate the healthcare needs by allowing healthcare to move from hospital-centered care to self-care, mobile care, and at-home care. When pervasive computing is used to provide technology-driven assistive healthcare, there is a need for the system to be as intelligent and sophisticated as possible, while also being as transparent and accountable as possible for both subject and caregivers. The CARA (Context Aware Real-time Assistant) healthcare system implements a sophisticated hybrid reasoning framework that incorporates both rule-based and case-based reasoning mechanisms. This provides a novel solution that combines context awareness, general domain knowledge, and automated intelligence for pervasive healthcare. The use of a sophisticated reasoning engine in healthcare demands accountability of the system. To improve the accountability of the reasoning system, we explored the use of case provenance to provide better understanding of the reasoning outcome to the user, and increase transparency. We developed a semantic-based mechanism to check the correctness and coherence of the fuzzy rules by detecting possible conflicts, this aims to eliminate inconsistency.},

 abstract = {Power electronics are increasingly important in new generation vehicles as critical safety mechanical subsystems are being replaced with more electronic components. Hence, it is vital that the health of these power electronic components is monitored for safety and reliability on a platform. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic approach for predicting the remaining useful life of power electronic components. The developed algorithms must also be embeddable and computationally efficient to support on-board real-time decision making. Current state-of-the-art prognostic algorithms, notably those based on Markov models, are computationally intensive and not applicable to real-time embedded applications. In this paper, an isolated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is used as a case study for prognostic development. The proposed approach is developed by analyzing failure mechanisms and statistics of IGBT degradation data obtained from an accelerated aging experiment. The approach explores various probability distributions for modeling discrete degradation profiles of the IGBT component. This allows the stochastic degradation model to be efficiently simulated, in this particular example ~1000 times more efficiently than Markov approaches.},

An Adult Prognostic Index (API) scoring system has been utilized which could be calculated on the basis of six important vital signs. Based on the value of Adult Prognostic Index, clinical rules may be identified to initiate alarms for monitoring of patient health conditions.},

 abstract = {As older adults age, they are more likely to reside in long-term care facilities due to the decline in cognitive and/or physical abilities that prevent them from living independently. With a rapidly aging population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services, assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan, schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate the specific design considerations and the impressions of long-term care residents, healthcare professionals, and family members on a socially assistive robot designed to autonomously facilitate cognitively and socially stimulating leisure activities. Thematic analysis of focus group sessions conducted at a long-term care facility with the aforementioned individuals revealed important design considerations for the development and integration of a socially assistive robot in long-term care facilities.},

In this paper, we present our findings on how affective feedback can be used to drive reinforcement learning in human-robot interactions (HRI) and other dialogue systems. We implemented a system where a humanoid robot, named ZOEI, acts as a standup comedian by entertaining a human audience in a bid to generate humor and positively influence the emotional state of the humans. The mood rating of the audience is recorded prior to the interaction session. Using a survey, the eventual emotional state of the human participant is captured after the HRI session. For each audience member, we capture feedback regarding how funny each joke was. We present the implementation of the content selection framework. We share our findings to substantiate the idea that by using expressive behaviors of the humanoid to influence the delivery of content (in this case, jokes) as well as employing reinforcement learning techniques for driving targeted content selection, the robot was able to improve the human mood score progressively across the 16 people who engaged in the study.},

 abstract = {Wireless sensor technologies can provide the leverage needed to enhance patient-caregivers collaboration through ubiquitous access and direct communication, which promotes smart and scalable vital sign monitoring of the chronically ill and elderly people live an independent life. However, the design and operation of BASNs are challenging, because of the limited power and small form factor of biomedical sensors. In this paper, an adaptive compression technique that aims at achieving low-complexity energy-efficient compression subject to time delay and distortion constraints is proposed. In particular, we analyze the processing energy consumption, then an energy consumption optimization model with constraints of distortion and time delay is proposed. Using this model, the Personal Data Aggregator (PDA) dynamically chooses the optimal compression parameters according to real-time measurements of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) or individual users. To evaluate and verify our optimization model, we develop an experimental testbed, where the EEG data is sent to the PDA that compresses the gathered data and forwards it to the server which decompresses and reconstructs the original signal. Experimental testbed and simulation results show that our adaptive compression technique can offer significant savings in the delivery time with low complexity and without affecting application accuracies.},

 abstract = {Wireless health systems enable remote and continuous monitoring of individuals, with applications in elderly care support, chronic disease management, and preventive care. The underlying sensing platform provides constructs that consider the quality of information driven from the system and ensure the reliability/validity of the outcomes to support the decision-making processes. In this paper, we present an approach to integrate contextual information within the data processing flow in order to improve the quality of measurements. We focus on a pilot application that uses wearable motion sensors to calculate metabolic equivalent of task (MET) of exergaming movements. Exergames need to show energy expenditure values, often using accelerometer approximations applied to general activities. We focus on two contextual factors, namely “activity type” and “sensor location,” and demonstrate how these factors can be used to enhance the measured values, since allocating larger weights to more informative sensors can improve the final measurements. Further, designing regression models for each activity provides better results than any generalized model. Indeed, the averaged R2 value for the movements using simple sensor location improve from a general 0.71 to as high as 0.84 for an individual activity type. The different methods present a range of R2 value averages across activity type from 0.64 for sensor location to 0.89 for multidimensional regression, with an average game play MET value of 7.93. Finally, in a leaveone-subject-out cross validation, a mean absolute error of 2.231 METs is found when predicting the activity levels using the best models.},

 abstract = {In the recent years several studies on population ageing in the most advanced countries argued that the share of people older than 65 years is steadily increasing. In order to tackle this phenomena, a significant effort has been devoted to the development of advanced technologies for supervising the domestic environments and their inhabitants to provide them assistance in their own home. In this context, the present paper aims to delineate a novel, highly-integrated system for advanced analysis of human behaviours. It is based on the fusion of the audio and vision frameworks, developed at the Multimedia Assistive Technology Laboratory (MATeLab) of the Università Politecnica delle Marche, in order to operate in the ambient assisted living context exploiting audio-visual domain features. The existing video framework exploits vertical RGB-D sensors for people tracking, interaction analysis and users activities detection in domestic scenarios. The depth information has been used to remove the affect of the appearance variation and to evaluate users activities inside the home and in front of the fixtures. In addition, group interactions are monitored and analysed. On the other side, the audio framework recognises voice commands by continuously monitoring the acoustic home environment. In addition, a hands-free communication to a relative or to a healthcare centre is automatically triggered when a distress call is detected. Echo and interference cancellation algorithms guarantee the high-quality communication and reliable speech recognition, respectively. The system we intend to delineate, thus, exploits multi-domain information, gathered from audio and video frameworks each, and stores them in a remote cloud for instant processing and analysis of the scene. Related actions are consequently performed.},

 abstract = {The design of an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to create better living conditions for the elderly, especially those who choose to live in their own houses, as long as possible. To this objective, AAL systems must mainly monitor the health status of the elderly through the analysis of data gathered via technologies based on sensor devices. Sensors networks produce collections of data of fine-grained nature, regarding general information such as device name, data type, data value, timestamp, but also specific one. The data analysis, due to its granularity and heterogeneity, makes very difficult to infer a clear overall view of the status of the elderly, it demands automatic tools for selecting meaningful data and mapping them in a common conceptual schema. In the last decade, ontologies became widely used tool to describe application domains and to enrich data with its meaning. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based methodology to perform semantic queries on a data repository, where records originated from networks of heterogeneous sources are stored. A semantic query is a pattern matching process that supports the recognition of specific temporal sequences of events that can be extracted from fine-grained data. In our framework a domain ontology are exploited at different levels of abstraction and the reasoning techniques are used to pre-process data for the final temporal analysis. The proposed approach is a deliverable of the ongoing AALISABETH project funded by Region Marche Government; while the software component is integrated into the AALISABETH framework.},

Thermal impedance can be used as a degradation indicator to detect this type of failure mode and issue early warnings for the aged IGBT.. In this research, different power dissipation conditions and ambient temperatures are discussed. Their impacts on the thermal impedance has been studied with FEA simulation and validated by the experimental results. This reveals the interplay between thermal impedance and these conditions. Furthermore, the health conditions of DCB substrate solders of the IGBT modules are altered by the aging test. The changes of junction temperature and thermal impedance are compared for solder layer in both health and fatigue conditions. This confirms the validity of the proposed condition monitoring method for vehicle-ready IGBT power modules.},

 abstract = {Accidental falls remain an important problem in older people. Stepping is a common task to avoid a fall and requires good interplay between sensory functions, central processing and motor execution. Increased choice stepping reaction time has been associated with recurrent falls in older people. The aim of this study was to examine if a sensor-based Exergame Choice Stepping Reaction Time test can successfully discriminate older fallers from non-fallers. The stepping test was conducted in a cohort of 104 community-dwelling older people (mean age: 80.7 ± 7.0 years). Participants were asked to step laterally as quickly as possible after a light stimulus appeared on a TV screen. Spatial and temporal measurements of the lower and upper body were derived from a low-cost and portable 3D-depth sensor (i.e. Microsoft Kinect) and 3D-accelerometer. Fallers had a slower stepping reaction time (970 ± 228 ms vs. 858 ± 123 ms, P = 0.001) and a slower reaction of their upper body (719 ± 289 ms vs. 631 ± 166 ms, P = 0.052) compared to non-fallers. It took fallers significantly longer than non-fallers to recover their balance after initiating the step (2147 ± 800 ms vs. 1841 ± 591 ms, P = 0.029). This study demonstrated that a sensor-based, low-cost and easy to administer stepping test, with the potential to be used in clinical practice or regular unsupervised home assessments, was able to identify significant differences between performances by fallers and non-fallers.},

 abstract = {As the elder population is increasing every year, spending on elder healthcare is also increasing. Older adult rate is increasing rapidly and is expected to double by 2030 to 20% increase in world population. A huge part of the healthcare expenditure is expected to be spent on older individuals particularly those with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson diseases, stroke patients in their rehabilitation phase which require continuous monitoring and medical care. This research work makes use of smart phones which have become ubiquitous and the capability of mobile networks having increased multifold in short duration, to address these issues. A constant and reliable assistive technology is essential while taking care of home-bound patients and elders. The proposed system has sensors to monitor the heart rate, body temperature, ECG, respiration rate, tilt and fall. Blood pressure can also be measured in cuff-less manner. The sensors are attached to the body of the elderly or home-bound patient in a wearable fashion. The data from the sensors can be sent to any Smartphone with Bluetooth support. In critical situations the caretaker will be given a notification via smartphone. Cuff-less BP monitoring will be a boon in case of continuous monitoring of health parameters.},

To reduce the time complexity, the proposed system utilizes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with only multiplication to replace the traditional modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). Such a transform can effectively reduce the computational time of proposed system. For recording the zeroes of the wavelet coefficients, an efficient zero recording algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses different encoding mode and corresponding bit data structure to further improve compression performance. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve about 33-fold improvement of the computation speed compared with the baseline, with also the similar rate-distortion performance. Such results indicate that the proposed system is superior to the baseline work to further be applied in low-end sound recording device for home-care services.},

Moreover, the use of Virtual Reality technology in rehabilitation has attracted significant interest in the physical therapy area. This paper presents PhysioMate, which is a project with the aim of developing software based on the concept of serious games for physical rehabilitation. The PhysioMate aims to encourage physical exercise in order to combat both physical and cognitive deterioration, functioning as a complement to the work of physical therapists, with and without their live supervision. Initially, the project has been focused on the rehabilitation of patients dependent on wheelchairs, whether they are victims of stroke or elderly people. Thus, we selected five essential simple movements of the upper-body for balance training and motor coordination, in which underlies the game mechanics of PhysioMate. We use the Microsoft Kinect sensor to detect and track the movements of patients.},

 abstract = {Many platforms have emerged as response to the call for technology supporting active and healthy aging. Key requirements for any such e-health systems and any subsequent business exploitation are tailor-made design and proper evaluation. This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability, user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than 100 participants. The use of formal tools makes the findings comparable to other studies and forms an elderly exergaming corpus.},

 abstract = {M-Health monitoring services have attracted more and more attentions especially for senior people. Many people living in elderly homes hope their health conditions to be monitored pervasively so that they could be warned before they get serious diseases. Comparing to traditional medical services which are usually provided within hospitals, m-Health monitoring faces more challenges in personalized health data processing from both views of supporting technology and application mode. In order to achieve personalized and high quality of health monitoring enabled by the new technologies, such as mobile network and cloud computing, in this paper, a framework of m-Health monitoring system based on cloud computing platform (Could-MHMS) is firstly proposed and designed to implement pervasive health monitoring. Furthermore, the modules of the framework are discussed, which are cloud data storage module, data analysis module, and resource allocation & assignment module, respectively. In data storage module, monitoring data are stored in multiple tenant spaces. Data analysis module uses domain knowledge to assess the monitored persons' health conditions. Service composition method is designed to dynamically allocate and assign public medical resources. These three modules cooperate to implement the core functions during the process of health monitoring which are data collection, data storage, data analysis, and medical resources assignment. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our architecture in the environment of elderly homes and show the usability of our method.},

This approach proposes to use ubiquitous sensors hidden in the environment for monitoring and detecting behavioral abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits and then do a proper guidance by giving hints using many kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.). In a smart environment, assistive system is an important technology in order to fulfill the need to provide support in living environment for people with cognitive deficit.

Features derived from ambient sensor data were found to be significantly correlated to measures of anxiety, sleep quality, depression, loneliness, cognition, quality of life and independent living skills (IADL). Subsequently, linear discriminant analysis was shown to predict participants suffering from increased anxiety and loneliness with a high accuracy (≥70%). While the number of participants is small, this study reports that objective ambient features may be used to infer clinically validated health metrics. Such findings may be used to inform interventions for active and healthy ageing.},

Lack of quality can lead assisted systems to respond inappropriately, resulting in errors related to assistance or support, or putting the user at risk. QoC assessments can improve these systems and set them to perform specific actions whenever lapses in quality occur. Initially, the study presents a literature review of QoC, then it introduces the context management architecture used. The proposal is verified with the Siafu simulator in an AAL scenario where the user's health is monitored with information about blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Considering some parameters, the proposed QoC assessment allows verifying the extent to which the context information is up-to-date, valid, accurate, complete and significant. The implementation of this proposal might mean a big social impact and a technological innovation applied to AAL, at the disposal and support of a significant number of individuals such as elderly or sick people, and with a more precise technology.},

In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.},

 abstract = {In ambient assisted living, one of the most concerning problems is how the living status of the elderly can be accurately judged through the data collected by ambient sensors. To solve this problem, environmental influences should be sufficiently considered. Some researchers have proposed collecting data comprehensively by distributed environmental sensors, but how the massive collected data were to be analyzed and transmitted was ignored. In this article, we propose a local data processing architecture on a local server to analyze collected data. In this three-layer architecture, the latest received data is stored in a data gathering layer. Afterward, a data filtering layer checks the efficiency of data. Also, this layer classifies the received data into static data reflecting sensors' status and a realtime data stream reflecting quality of life. For static data, they are directly stored in a database, and the real-time data stream is divided into different levels. Based on these levels, a data analyzing layer reorganizes data into a neighborhood structure, which will be called RDAA. A risk factor is returned by RDAA and only abnormal data will be sent to a health care provider when its risk factor is larger than a given threshold. LDAP disperses the stress of remote centralized processing and data storage, which decreases the workload of the remote health care provider. Meanwhile, it also reduces network load and improves processing speed.},

Numerous existing indoor navigation systems have been proposed in order to solve such problems. However, these papers do not adequately examine the effectiveness of the systems in real time trials and are faced with a variety of technical and usability problems. In our paper, we present a unique and elegant architecture of an indoor navigation system as an integrated and tested system in real time. This solution enables the localization of the user, as well as the navigation, considering scenarios that the user might follow and suggests guidelines for self-navigation.},

 abstract = {Robot social support systems such as robot partner's game interactions with elderly people are very important in ageing societies. Human-robot interaction can decrease the risk of ageing disease such as dementia and thus improve the overall quality of life for the elderly people. However, in order for the robot partner to have successful game interactions with the elderly people, the robot partners need to be equipped with a certain degree of cognitive intelligence to guess the meaning and context of game interactions. In this paper, we discuss a biological stress-inspired model for the robot's cognitive intelligence with dynamic optimisation on its working memory. We name this novel robot's cognitive framework as Advanced Intelligence Cognitive Optimisation (AICO). AICO is a server framework for computational intensive cognitive processing for the smart phone robot known as iPhonoid. We have conducted physical robot experiments with our proposed iPhonoid AICO framework on Rényi-Ulam guessing game with real human subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed AICO framework successfully increased the robot's guessing performance in the game interactions. At the same time, the robot behaves according to its emotional conditions to make the game play interesting for the elderly people.},

Dementia is one of the common cognitive problems among the elderly population where a basic daily dining activity could be difficult for them to perform. Drinking activities is one of the most important daily needs to keep a person away from dehydrating. Most of the existing works on dining activities recognitions are mainly based on wearable sensors and sensor rich eating utensil. Although the accuracy for sensor based techniques is high, some of the elderly might be reluctant to wear, and some might even forgot to wear altogether. In this paper, we propose a novel system that is purely based on depth data from an RGB-D camera for drinking activities recognition. Dynamic time warping algorithm is used to recognize and detect the drinking activities.},

 abstract = {Over the past century, in most developed and rapidly developing countries, there has been a continual increase in life expectancy primarily due to improvements in public health, nutrition and medicine. However, this is now coupled with aging population demographics and falling birth rates, which when combined, are expected to significantly burden the socio-economic well-being of many of these countries. In fact, never before in human history have we been confronted with such a large aging population, nor have we developed solid, cost-effective solutions for the healthcare and social needs and well-being of the elderly. In this presentation, we will describe an ongoing project in Ubiquitous (U)-Healthcare - a smart medical home. In our work, we are using advances in information technology, wireless communication, web-based technologies and autonomics, to develop new, smart and cost-effective solutions for the health wellness of the elderly. Such a solution would enable elderly to lead independent lifestyles in their own homes while being continuously monitored for the early detection of symptoms, so diseases can be treated earlier than in later stages as is currently done; to promote health wellness; as well as to treat chronic illnesses. In this presentation, through a few examples, we will discuss our ongoing work and the challenges we have uncovered, plus some of the research issues we are pursuing. In particular, we will focus on the critical role of information technology (IT) in developing innovative, low-cost and high impacting solutions to the pending elderly demographic crisis. Several examples will be described to highlight IT for U-Health.},

Due to the diversity of the sensors and other hardware employed, however, designing, implementing, and accepting standard tests is a difficult task. This article presents an initiative to evaluate activity recognition systems: a living-lab evaluation established through the annual Evaluating Ambient Assisted Living Systems through Competitive Benchmarking-Activity Recognition (EvAAL-AR) competition. In the EvAAL-AR, each team brings its own activity-recognition system; all systems are evaluated live on the same activity scenario performed by an actor. The evaluation criteria attempt to capture practical usability: recognition accuracy, user acceptance, recognition delay, installation complexity, and interoperability with ambient assisted living systems. Here, the authors discuss the competition and the competing systems, focusing on the system that achieved the best recognition accuracy, and the system that was evaluated as the best overall. The authors also discuss lessons learned from the competition and ideas for future development of the competition and of the activity recognition field in general.},

However, the quality of service can be severely degraded by concomitant inter-WBAN interference in some specific environments where multiple WBANs are densely deployed, e.g., hospitals and senior citizen communities. In this work, we propose a Bayesian game based power control scheme to mitigate the impact of inter-WBAN interference. By modeling WBANs as players and active links as types of players in the Bayesian game model, the proposed power control scheme tries to maximize each player's expected payoff involving both throughput and energy efficiency. We prove the existence of Bayesian equilibrium (BE) for the proposed power control game and also derive a practical sufficient condition for the uniqueness of BE. A harmonic mean based algorithm is then proposed to obtain an approximation of BE point without the need to pass message among WBANs, which satisfies the non-cooperative manner for inter-WBAN interference mitigation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge to the BE point effectively.},

Smartphone-based intervention techniques present the opportunity to support cost-effective behavioral intervention to promote physical activity. We present a pilot study that examines the feasibility of utilizing the “Strive” smartphone-based passive sensing application to motivate older adults to stay active. Eight participants aged between 50 and 80 years used the application over a period of three weeks to track their daily activity habits. Participants carried smartphones to track daily activities and introspected about their lifestyles as part of weekly check-in sessions. The value that 24×7 smartphone-based sensors provided to this population was an easy-to-use and always available companion to promote awareness about their physical activity. The main motivations for participants to stay active were to prevent loss of personal health due ageing and the need to stay young. Participants increased their daily physical activity by 15% over the first week. This increase was mainly driven by the younger participants. Participants were willing to bear the inconvenience of physical activity tracking due a phone if it meant that they would obtain a better report of their daily physical activities. Any application that tracks physical activity using smartphones needs to address the wearability of the phone.},

 abstract = {To promote independent living for elderly population activity recognition based approaches have been investigated deeply to infer the activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADLs). Deriving and integrating the gestural activities (such as talking, coughing, and deglutition etc.) along with activity recognition approaches can not only help identify the daily activities or social interaction of the older adults but also provide unique insights into their long-term health care, wellness management and ambulatory conditions. Gestural activities (GAs), in general, help identify fine-grained physiological symptoms and chronic psychological conditions which are not directly observable from traditional activities of daily living. In this paper, we propose GeSmart, an energy efficient wearable smart earring based GA recognition model for detecting a combination of speech and non-speech events. To capture the GAs we propose to use only the accelerometer sensor inside our smart earring due to its energy efficient operations and ubiquitous presence in everyday wearable devices. We present initial results and insights based on a C4.5 classification algorithm to infer the infrequent GAs. Subsequently, we propose a novel change-point detection based hybrid classification method exploiting the emerging patterns in a variety of GAs to detect and infer infrequent GAs. Experimental results based on real data traces collected from 10 users demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of GAs classification by over 23%, compared to previously proposed pure classification-based solutions. We also note that the accelerometer sensor based earrings are surprisingly informative and energy efficient (by 2.3 times) for identifying different types of GAs.},

 abstract = {In the Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan (UM), we have spent the past five years building social context into several courses in the traditional computer science (CS) curriculum. Specifically, freshman- and senior-level, project-based classes have been designed to both teach significant and appropriate academic content, while also building software games and apps for children with cognitive and/or physical disabilities within the university's associated hospital. Children with disabilities provide the context for these courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional curriculum. The cadence of the course(s) is typically: propose, pitch, form groups, design, build, test, and improve. Each student submits a written proposal for the project. A group of experts read all of the proposals, and choose the `best' for pitching to the other students in the course. Groups are formed, using student preferences, based upon the pitches. The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final) of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through subsequent independent studies or internships. If the software project is `minimally viable', the groups are encouraged to continue development and work with the university's Center for Entrepreneurship or Office of Technology Transfer toward eventual commercialization. During the past academic year (2013-2014), one of the senior-level courses had the singular focus of developing software apps and games for a 13 year old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy. Her family was actively involved in the course, filt- ring project ideas and offering suggestions for improvement. Some of the most promising apps are currently installed in the family's house for methodical review and eventual improvement. This paper will discuss the general process that is used in this style of course, the specific approach that was used during the 2013-2014 academic year, and offer general suggestions for implementation in disciplines other than computer science.},

 abstract = {The number of seniors and other people needing daily assistance continues to increase, but the current human resources available to achieve this in the coming years will certainly be insufficient. To remedy this situation, smart habitats have emerged as an innovative avenue for supporting needs of daily assistance. Smart homes aim to provide cognitive assistance in decision making by giving hints, suggestions, and reminders, with different kinds of effectors, to residents. To implement such technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of ongoing activity. Some researchers have proposed solutions based on binary sensors or cameras, but these types of approaches infringed on residents' privacy. A new affordable activity-recognition system based on passive RFID technology can detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The entire system relies on an innovative model of elliptical trilateration with several filters, as well as on an ingenious representation of activities with spatial zones. The authors have deployed the system in a real smart-home prototype; this article renders the results of a complete set of experiments conducted on this new activity-recognition system with real scenarios.},

This proposal considers as restriction connectivity costs. The proposal was designed considering the Scenario-Based Design methodology. In formation is related to a project conducted a long one year in Harmony house. Meanwhile, we were designing the communication infrastructure. Our architecture was evaluated by 2 caregivers and 2 nurses from Harmony house. The results showed high scores in analyzed aspects: perceived ease of use, usefulness and intended use. We conclude that in order to complement and enhance the initial design, it is necessary to carry out an in-site evaluation. Our future work includes to analyze the architecture performance under different connectivity scenarios.},

 abstract = {In response to elderly people with independent living, healthcare services for elderly people is intended to be provided at homes, particularly for elderly with long-term care services and some disabilities. The health service can be facilitated utilizing the use of ubiquitous home care, equipped by connected technologies. Interoperability system has an important role in ubiquitous home care. By understanding the system interoperability requirements, the resulting ubiquitous home care system design becomes more effectively. Unfortunately, usability in designing ubiquitous home care is still less concern. Lack of usability concern will contribute in poorly designed of home care system for elderly. Elderly people will get difficulties in learning and operating the system. Poor designed system can create many human errors. Designing a user friendly ubiquitous home care system based on needs and preferences of elderly is such an important thing. The objective of this paper is to investigate a ubiquitous home care model for the elderly from the perspective of human centered design and interoperability. As a result, a well-designed home care for elderly people based on human centered approach will be able to encapsulate interoperability problems among medical devices.},

Interviews and a focus group were used to establish their understandings of online community and social networking sites (SNS) within the context of existing relationships in local communities. Past experiences of local community influenced expectations for online community and its authenticity. At the same time four catalysts were identified which motivated engagement with community resources both online and locally. These were: 'spaces and places', family, roles and loss. A sense of 'real' community was maintained through meeting people face to face with online communities and SNS being used predominantly as tools for achieving this aim. Exploration of the catalysts offers ways that greater community involvement might be further facilitated through design initiatives that make online community feel more 'real' to older users.},

 abstract = {In this paper we compare and evaluate different time segments of patient handling transfer techniques at a residential nursing home for the elderly. Nursing personnel were accompanied over three weeks and transfer techniques between bed and chair were recorded with a stopwatch. The total transfer time of a patient transfer is divided into three segments: preparation, transfer and dismantling time. The nursing staff at the residential nursing home makes use of three transfer techniques: the ubiquitous manual transfer, transfers with slide sheets and transfers using floor lifts. These transfer techniques have been analyzed and compared showing that floor lifts require significantly more time in all three segments (311 s) than slide sheets (115 s) and manual transfers (74 s), while slide sheets only slightly increase the time taken to accomplish a comfortable repositioning of the patient. The manual transfer is still by far the most popular method, despite numerous studies that have evaluated such methods hazardous. New devices are necessary that must accommodate a safe transfer and be as fast as a manual transfer in order to be accepted among nursing staff as the demand for professional nursing staff continues to rise.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the increase in aging population in developed countries has become one of the most important societal challenges. It is becoming more and more important to ensure quality care and services in countries with a rapidly increasing ageing population and find solutions to lower the costs of healthcare. Digital technologies could present a solution in the form of digital health but the question of ubiquitous availability of these technologies is then brought to the forefront. Mobile broadband has become the fastest growing market segment which makes mHealth applications a good alternative for offering healthcare and well-being services to a wide range of users. However, without a ubiquitous and reliable mobile broadband connection, the availability of most high-bandwidth and life-critical applications is still questionable. In addition, privacy and confidentiality have always been important cornerstones in healthcare and must also be ensured in mHealth applications. Of particular interest are self-monitoring mobile applications, which have shown promise in increasing awareness of the variability of patient symptoms as well as offering reassurance through monitoring. Therefore, low-bandwidth, non-critical mHealth applications, which take advantage of existing networks and give users the opportunity to monitor their health parameters with the added input from their physician, should be more widely implemented. In this article the above-mentioned challenges are discussed and an example of an implementation of an mHealth application for diabetes self-management is presented.},

This paper tap on the ubiquitous mobile device and proposes the development of a mobile phone based assistive visual aid for the elderly hearing impaired to assist them in their daily life when they choose not to or cannot afford to wear hearing aids. In fact, the proposed assistive visual hearing aid can be used by the hearing impaired community at large and not just confined to the elderly. The visual “hearing” aid takes the form of a noninvasive, inexpensive, in-conspicuous and easy-to-use app on a mobile phone or tablet in which the elderly can record the speech. It will automatically perform a speech-to-text conversion locally on the mobile phone in real time such that the elderly can read the text visually. Non-real time conversion is also made available where the conversion is done at the backend server via Internet. This app is intended to enable the hearing impaired community and the elderly to lead a fulfilling and independent lifestyle despite the challenges caused by their impairments.},

An automatic remote monitoring system using wearable and ambient sensors is becoming even more important, and is a challenge for the future in WSNs, AAL, and Home Automation areas. Relating to this, one of the most critical events for the safety and the health of the elderly is the fall. Lot of methods, applications, and stand-alone devices have been presented so far. This work proposes a novel method based on the Support Vector Machine technique and addressed to Android low-cost smartphones. Our method starts from data acquired from accelerometer and magnetometer, now available in all the low-end devices, and uses a set of features extracted from a processing of the two signals. After an initial training, the classification of fall events and non-fall events is performed by the Support Vector Machine algorithm. Since we have decided to use the smartphone as monitoring device, the use of other invasive wearable sensors is avoided, and the user have simply to hold the phone on his pocket. Moreover, we can use the cellular network for the eventual sending of notifications and alerts to relatives in case of falls. Actually, our tests show a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.3% and a specificity of 96%.},

The innovations introduced by pervasive computing, and in particular by sensor-based activity monitoring methods, can be exploited to early detect the onset of health issues.

The objective is to support the clinicians in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, providing them with fine-grained information about abnormal behaviors. In this paper, we present a demonstration of the method, based on a graphical tool that simulates the execution of activities and abnormal behaviors of an elderly person in a sensor-rich smart home.},

Sensor signals are collected wirelessly and processed on a local computer. With the captured data, we develop data analysis techniques to make a comparison between gait characteristics in older adults with or without glaucoma.

Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is a new subfield of robotics that bridges human-robot interaction (HRI), rehabilitation robotics, social robotics, and service robotics. SAR focuses on developing machines capable of assisting users, typically in health and education contexts, through social rather than physical interaction. The robot's physical embodiment is at the heart of SAR's effectiveness, as it leverages the inherently human tendency to engage with lifelike (but not necessarily humanlike or otherwise biomimetic) social behavior. This talk will describe research into embodiment, modeling and steering social dynamics, and long-term user adaptation for SAR. The research will be grounded in projects involving analysis of multi-modal activity data, modeling personality and engagement, formalizing social use of space and non-verbal communication, and personalizing the interaction with the user over a period of months. The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated by human subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.},

Since senior citizens are at high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend will challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive computing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the onset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method relying on medical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and furniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a novel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect first the activities being performed and then the abnormal aspects in carrying out those activities, which are communicated to the medical center. Differently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the system and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an instrumented smart home. Experimental results show that our technique has a high precision while generating a small number of false positives.},

GiraffPlus is a EU funded project, running in several test sites across Europe, that combines social interaction and long-term monitoring to help people live independently. In this context, the proposed localization algorithm is able to provide the position information in terms of last room visited by the user improving considerably the reaction of a user's caregiver in emergency situations. This paper also aims at providing a performance characterization of the commercially available devices used in the GiraffPlus AAL environments.

 abstract = {Ambient assisted living (AAL) can be defined as “the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in a person's daily living and working environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected and live independently into old age” (www.aal-europe.eu). Research in the AAL community covers a wide range of topics, but one of the largest is human activity recognition and behavior understanding, with the objectives of detecting and recognizing actions, activity, and situations within an environment. AAL systems go beyond observing to interact with users. A frequently employed form of human-machine interaction is via prompts-for example, prompting the user to perform the next step in a sequence of actions. Another type of interaction is haptic responses, which have been used in systems for visually impaired people. Two important elements of an appropriate response are an understanding of the user's context and anticipatory capability. Context awareness underpins much of AAL research-human activities are generally context dependent.

In this paper we present the design and evaluation of an ambient game, GuessMyCaption, aimed at enhancing the social networks of older adults, known to have an impact in their wellbeing. GuessMyCaption was deployed during a 5-weeks study in the home of one older adult and twelve relatives. The results demonstrate that GuessMyCaption is easy to use and maintains an older adult engaged with exercises while offering new opportunities for online and offline socialization. GuessMyCaption had a positive impact in the perceived wellbeing of the older adult improving her perception on her cognitive skills and physical health, and catalyzing socialization. This research shows that the use of natural interfaces and family memorabilia facilitate the adoption of serious games, improves older adults' perceived wellbeing, and encourage socialization.},

Four patients with middle cerebral artery stroke were evaluated, before and after 32 rehabilitation sessions. After CST identification at the level of the pons, manual regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn, by two independent evaluators. We observed a superior result in the neuronal integrity measurements for both evaluators in the game-rehabilitated patients, but the differences were not statistically significant. The results suggest that the CST may recover through rehabilitation, and also that games-based rehabilitation may be superior to conventional rehabilitation, although further studies are still necessary to confirm these findings.},

Although recent developments in the video game industry have heightened the need to involve players in the design process, the research to date has tended to focus on participatory design with children rather than older adults. Moreover, due to the lack of information regarding gamers' social context and their experiences, there has been little agreement on whether video games with a multiplayer dimension are suitable for this age group. Through online and face-to-face group workshops with five experienced and five novice gamers aged 50 and over, we discuss the potential of social network games for older adults and the main game design components, which can encourage them to play. The results of this study suggest that a player versus environment (PvE) mode is preferred to player versus player (PvP) games and that collaboration between players should be prioritized over competition. This target also seems to prefer off-game communication tools to extend their virtual relationships.},

Understanding and stimulating the emotional state of an individual can help to prevent inactivity, encourage higher level of physical activities, and general wellbeing. This approach has shown the extraordinary importance of emotions for the evaluation of situations in social contexts. Its results could serve as a neuroscientific grid for social solutions based on research on affects and emotions to actively prevent neural cells from stress. Our understanding and the technological monitoring of emotional states of the brain are now at a stage that an integrative solution can be realised to facilitate a healthy living of a new ageing generation. The aim is to develop a biofeedback system to prevent inactivity (often associated with blue mood and depression, atrophy and rapid decrease of the plasticity of the brain and the aging of neural cells). We developed and going to test a biofeedback system as a human-machine-human system preventing neural deterioration and stress. The envisaged applications will particularly strengthen the technological capacity and will be an important basis for further clinical or technological applications that preserve health and independence in old age.},

Commonly used mobile operating systems are Android, iOS and Windows. Android stands out with its open source nature and working capabilities on inexpensive mobile devices. Real-time location tracking is continuously monitoring a vehicle or a person by using obtained coordinates with GPS, Wi-Fi or Cell-Id. Considering that the client person uses mobile phone with internet on it, location tracking can be done with a mobile application. Therefore, using GPS sensor suffers from rapid energy consumption. This paper presents design and implementation of an android based energy aware real-time location tracking system (EWAREL) using GPS sensor. Its hybrid positioning technique employs other inertial sensors and data sending mechanism for saving energy to be efficient. Introduced EWAREL is a lifesaving application especially for real-time monitoring elderly people suffering from Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's people are monitored with EWAREL application and are prevented from being lost. EWAREL is ready to be generalized for other scenarios such as other health monitoring applications, giving direction, monitoring and directing of field staff.},

 abstract = {Ambient assisted living technologies (AALT) are considered to offer means for reducing health care burden to societies by prolonging capability for independent living and by improving the quality of life for elderly persons suffering from dementia and their caregivers. This research presents a novel activity support framework for transforming cooking activities in to workflow process models optimized for people suffering from dementia. This is achieved by first splitting a cooking activity in to tasks composed of set of basic actions. Due to nature of dementia, actions taken by a care recipient can be considered to be stochastic. This research presents a model of a care recipient suffering from dementia based on data from literature. The model contains probability distribution of possible outcomes mapped to available basic actions in a cooking activity. This allows the use of Markov decision process (MDP) to determine optimal sequence of actions to perform a cooking activity. The resulting process models can be used as set of instructions by a prompting system or as a process model for a belief monitor type of AALTs. The designed framework was tested by comparing manually constructed and verified process model to one produced by a test computer program. Further research is needed to refine the care recipient model, study transforming cooking recipes into cooking activity models and to validate the framework in real-world settings.},

At the same time, rates of disability are increasing due to population ageing and increases in chronic health conditions. These bring great challenge to elderly and disabled care in the whole society, since their physiological and pathological characteristics always bring them many inconveniences. In order to better serve the disabled and elderly people and provide them timely care in some public places, it is important to be aware of the location of them. At present, this has been a key focus that includes determining their physical location accurately and turning coordinates into meaningful information. This paper provides a sensor fusion-based infrastructure independent and agile real-time indoor positioning technology which can be used in monitoring the exact three-dimensional indoor location of the elderly and disabled people. It takes advantage of the built-in sensors in the wearable devices to analyze human movement and combine the map information to improve the location accuracy. The most prominent feature of method is that it requires no training or extra infrastructure. The experimental results show that the algorithm obtains high localization precision and preferable robustness.},

There are many devices on the market that will analyse one or two signals very well, but there is a considerable need for a device that can bring together a synergy of sensors, producing one coherent snapshot of a patient. Therefore, the proposed system in this paper aims to assemble multiple sensor inputs into one accessible, hand-held device as well as simplifying the gathering and sending of the vital sign data to help support the elderly. The signals collected include: ECG and PPG measurements, blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) and core body temperature. It has also been specifically designed to allow cuff-less estimation of Blood Pressure (BP) and modelling has been done to show its current accuracy. The device will produce meaningful and easy to read results that aim to satisfy both the patient and medical professionals for both quality and quantity of data.

 abstract = {Independent living is one of the main challenges linked to an increasing ageing population and concerns both patients and healthy elderlies. A lot of research has focused on the area of ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies towards an intelligent caring home environment able to offer personalized context-aware applications to serve the user's needs. This paper proposes the use of advised sensing, context-aware and cloud-based lifestyle reasoning to design an innovative eHealth platform that supports highly personalized smart services to primary users. The architecture of the platform has been designed in accordance with the interoperability requirements and standards as proposed by ITU-T and Continua Alliance. In particular, we define the interface dependencies and functional requirements needed, to allow eCare and eHealth vendors to manufacture interoperable sensors, ambient and home networks, telehealth platforms, health support applications and software services. Finally, data mining techniques in relation to the proposed architecture are also proposed to enhance the overall AAL experience of the users.},

 abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.},

 abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities. To address these limitations we propose a multi-modal system architecture for AAL remote healthcare monitoring in the home, gathering information from multiple, diverse (sensor) data sources. In this paper we report on developments made to-date in various technical areas with respect to critical issues such as cost, power consumption, scalability, interoperability and privacy.},

 abstract = {According to the WHO report in 2013, the world population aging over 60 years is predicted to increase to 20 million in 2050. Aging comes about many challenges to elders due to their cognitive decline, chronic age-related diseases, as well as limitations in physical activity, vision, and hearing. Recent advances in wearable computing and mobile health technology create new opportunity for ambient assisted living system to help the person perform the activities safely and independently. The activity monitoring of daily living is the core technique of the ambient assisted living system. Several well-known approaches have utilized various sensors for activity recognition such as camera, RFID, infrared detector and inertial sensor. Since the activities are well characterized by the objects, location or hand gesture that are manipulated during their performance on activities of daily living. However, some applications included, e.g. the monitoring of specific tasks and/or movements in a rehabilitation scenario or the classification of dietary intake gestures for an automated nutrition monitoring system, where reliable activity recognition on a more fine-grained level is needed. To fulfill the requirement, we design a hierarchical window approach based on the dynamic time warping algorithm to achieve fine-grained activity recognition, where the template selection and threshold configuration is developed to cope with the ambiguity with similar features. Furthermore, a confidence estimation for the pattern matching is also proposed. The recognition procedure was successfully adapted to the investigated cleaning tasks. The overall performance in precision, recall, and F1-socre is 89.0%, 88.6%, and 88.1% respectively. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is reliable and fulfills the requirements of the ambient assisted living.},

In elderly people, such mobility limitation is worsened by the reduced self-confidence and the fear of falling, leading to a further motor deterioration. This work presents an application of a wireless Body Sensor Network as a simple and easy-to-use individual motor function assessment tool for elderly. The wearable nodes have been exploited to monitor the body during the Six-Minute Walk Test and a set of stability tests. During the exercises, wearable sensors inertial data, along with the real-time orientation of the platforms, have been exploited to obtain gold-standard indicators (such as total distance) and some additional gait parameters. Stability tests consist of a series of single and double stance exercises aimed to assess the balance of the subject. This paper presents the system, the processing and the preliminary results on two subjects groups of different ages (31±6 and 70.8±7).},

 abstract = {Sustaining lower limb functionality is extremely important in the preventative care of the elderly. Chair exercise, in which the exerciser sits on an ordinary chair, offers a way for senioars with little physical strength to exercise without a great deal of effort. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Kinect sensor that is capable of detecting human motion without the subject having to wear any kind of a special marker are becoming widely available. Exploiting this new sensor technology, this paper describes the development and deployment of a prototype lower limb chair exercise support system that takes full advantage of the Kinect depth sensor. The system supports five different chair exercises designed to strengthen the lower limbs, recognizes and evaluates exercises based on 3D position data and joint angles for each joint obtained from the Kinect sensor. The system illustrates how to do the exercises by voice instructions and model images, and superimposes the muscles used onto an image of the exerciser in real time. The system also provides exercise assessment results and advice by voice and text. In a series of trials involving seven elderly subjects in their late 70s and early 80s, an overall average recognition rate of 89% was obtained for the five exercises.},

 abstract = {We proposed a completely unconstrained method for long-term monitoring sleep quality of residents in nursing homes using an Internet-based automatic sleep monitoring system, "Umemory". When a resident lies in bed, his/her heart pulsation, respiration, and body movement are sensed by a piezoelectric transducer under a mattress. The corresponding digital signal is sent to database servers via Internet, and further processed in the servers. 1090 days' data from 13 subjects in 2 nursing homes were obtained by this system for evaluation. Through comparing with records provided by nursing home staff, we found that this system could provide detailed information about the nursing home residents' sleep quality. Furthermore, the analysis result provided information such as "in-bed" body movement and sleep quality, which was unable to be constantly observed by nursing home staff at all. Therefore, it is concluded that our method may serve as an effective and convenient tool for automatic monitoring nursing home residents' sleep quality. This system may also lessen the burden of nursing home staff and be used to optimize personal specific healthcare service.},

 abstract = {Smart environments have progressed and evolved into a significant research area with development of sensor technology, wireless communication and machine learning strategies. Ambient Intelligence incorporated into smart environment assists in resolving many social related applications to facilitate the future society. The initiative of modeling Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) in smart homes have helped in the deployment of applications to various domains like elderly care, health care etc. Activity recognition is the task involved in reasoning within smart homes with the aim of recognizing the ongoing activity of the occupant. Constructing an activity model is essential to carry out recognition and is achieved through various machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Data driven approach constructs activity model through statistical machine learning mechanisms while knowledge driven approach constructs activity model through knowledge representation and modeling strategies. Uncertainty and temporal data are better handled by data driven approach while re-usability and context based analysis is handled better by knowledge driven approach of activity modeling. To combine the features of data driven and knowledge driven approaches, a hybrid activity modeling technique is required. The proposed system performs activity modeling via Markov Logic Network, a machine learning strategy that combines probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning with a single framework. Activities in a smart home are categorized as simple and composite activities, wherein composite activities are defined as related simple activities within a given time interval. The proposed system models both simple and composite activity using soft and hard rules of MLN. Experiments carried over the proposed system shows the effectiveness of the proposed work for recognizing simple and composite activity.},

 abstract = {The growing of ageing population worldwide and the need to concentrate research efforts on a specific target group motivate our research and focus on frail ageing people with chronic disease and physical/cognitive deficiencies. The primary goal is to maintain frail and dependant people in their own home and delay as much as possible their placement in a nursing home, through reliable assistive technologies, to maximize their physical and mental function, and to continue to engage in social networks with the community, so that they can continue to lead an independent and purposeful life. Today, providing assistive services for frail and dependant people could be done following two ways: the first axis consists on seeking assistive technologies dedicated not only to end-users, but also, and even mainly, to helper around the user (relatives, neighbours, caregivers,..) to supervise Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The second axis could be to concentrate on rehabilitation and coaching solutions targeting people with chronic disease (ex. diabetes type 2) helping them modify their lifestyle to manage their health conditions. Such systems focus mainly on developing serious games deployable at home and connected to regional or national health information systems (e.g. the shared medical file database in France). Consequently, in both options, the development cost is high, and this is also the reason that most smart home projects are still at the research lab level worldwide. There are efforts trying to transfer the research lab demonstration prototypes into homes or nursing homes, but migrating systems from a well controlled research lab environment into a much more complex real-world environment introduces tremendous challenges in terms of correctness, reliability and fault-tolerant requirements. Our objective is to promote demonstration guidelines and lessons learned in order to reach this goal. The presented work focuses on the quality of life of ageing people having co- nitive and functional limitations, combined with diabetes type 2, and on recent achievements realised in France and Singapore.},

These solutions, which often involve fall detection with accelerometers, are accurate in laboratory conditions but can fail in some real-life situations. To overcome this, the authors present the Confidence system, which detects falls mainly with location sensors. A user wears one to four tags. By detecting tag locations with sensors, the system can recognize the user's activity, such as falling and then lying down afterward, as well as the context in terms of the location in the home. The authors used a scenario consisting of events difficult to recognize as falls or nonfalls to compare the Confidence system with accelerometer-based fall-detection methods, some augmented with context data from a location sensor. The methods that used context information were approximately 30 percent more accurate than those that did not. The Confidence system was also successfully validated in a real-life setting with elderly users.},

Apart from falls themselves, most dramatic consequences are usually related with long lying periods that can cause serious side effects. These findings call for pervasive long-term fall detection systems able to automatically detect falls. In this paper, we propose an effective fall detection algorithm for mobile platforms. Using data retrieved from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs) and/or SmartPhones (SPs), our algorithm is able to detect falls using features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope. While mostly of the mobile-based solutions for fall management deal only with accelerometer data, in the proposed approach we combine the instantaneous acceleration magnitude vector with changes of the user's heading in a Threshold Based Algorithm (TBA). In such a way, we were able to handle falls detection with minimal computational load, increasing the overall system accuracy with respect to traditional fall management methods. Experimental results show the strong detection performance of the proposed solution in discriminating between falls and typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) presenting fall-like acceleration patterns.},

Dedicated to everyday physiological monitor, we have developed a multi-parameter smart armband which is able record pulse, temperature and triaxial accelerations continuously. With the wearable device and signal processing algorithm, experiments of data acquisition in the daily living have been implemented on the volunteers. The long period record of 38 hours has demonstrated its feasibility of a total record without disturbing.

Ubiquitous unobtrusive monitoring and training (recently much blended by means of exergames) has become reality due to the availability of new mobile sensors and devices and the emergence of new technologies and services. The current piece of work presents the different milestones we have achieved as best practices during the past seven years of piloting training and exergaming ICT components in an effort to support Active and Healthy Aging.

 abstract = {In his ACM Computers in Entertainment article, titled "Artist and Audience: Emerging the Nano-entertainment experience" [1], the author posited on how Inhabited Information Spaces, created as core catalyst of research, may be questioned as a multisensory future virtual work of art. This themed Human-Computer Interaction for Entertainment contribution for the EAI INTETAIN 2015 conference builds upon the earlier work by questioning meaning making from such self-active entertainment experiences. Contextually, self-active relates to actor empowerment via ICT, whilst entertainment refers to HCI paradigms that are fun, engaging, and enjoyable. Conceptualizing, designing and realizing alternative digital media entertainment situations in stage performance, interactive installations and exhibitions at leading Museums for Modern Art, National and International major events, contributed to development of a sensor-based system conceived as a platform to investigate meaning making having societal impact beyond art. The system involves arrays of selectable sensor profiles mixed and matched according to requirements. Sensing of human input can be through worn (biosignal e.g. EEG, ECG, EMG, GSR), held, and/or non-worn sensors (volumetric, linear and planar interface profiles). Mapping of sourced human data is to a variety of digital content including art-based (music making, digital painting, lighting effects), video games, Virtual Reality and robotic devices. System adaptability promotes participant profile matching e.g. according to desired outcome. All ages and abilities are potential users., eceding the commonly known camera-based game controllers such as EyeToy, Wii, and Kinect; the SoundScapes Virtual Interactive Space [2] system has been used in institutes, hospitals and clinics to empower people with impairment to unconsciously push their limits of functionality via creative and playful expression. Rehabilitation is less mundane and boring, where variety of ICT-based inte- vention motivates whilst offering creative opportunities for facilitators. Additionally, in a randomized intervention study with frail elderly patients, Hagedorn and Holm reported significant clinical rehabilitation impact up to 400% in the ICT feedback training specific performance [3]. This work highlights how co-informing paradigms between computer and human science and art, games and healthcare, can result in societal impact as well as commercial patented product and industry start-ups. At the core of the research is a rethinking in the way a human interacts with ICT. Current research explores a concept of dynamic air and alternative physical-virtual environments. Conclusions introduce a suggested need of increased researcher awareness of post-research effect following intervention/trials within healthcare and rehabilitation.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in cloud computing and ubiquitous computing have changed the computing paradigm rapidly. Cloud computing is the computing that relies on a large pool of systems interconnected in private or public networks to deliver computing resources like services and data. Nowadays, there is no need of having local servers or personal devices to handle applications and data. Access to these resources for everyone and anywhere has become a necessity. Moreover, the evolution of ubiquitous computing combined with cloud computing implies the development of personalized services and applications considering the user preferences in order to provide an appropriate user interface anywhere anytime. However, the user interfaces so far are not conforming to the needs of people and especially those with disabilities or elderly. The paper introduces an accessible tool for declaring and managing user preferences that participate in personalization implementation in cloud computing environment. The proposed tool focuses mostly on elderly and people with disabilities and helps the users to build preference sets in order to improve access efficiency.},

For instance, recent research provided many examples of possible applications of robots in the education and rehabilitation of people with learning difficulties and/or intellectual disabilities. In this paper, we present a study on how cultural backgrounds can influence the perception and intention to use a robot as an instrument in the future practice. The study involved 37 Italian students and 37 UK students, as future professionals in the field of psychology, which experienced the actual capabilities of a humanoid robot through a live demo. In this work, we explored the main factors of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the aim to reveal cultural differences. The instrument used was the UTAUT questionnaire, which was designed and validated to investigate the robot acceptance and use. A significant difference on the intention to use the robot is reported in our results. The discriminant analysis produced a very high degree of separation between the two groups, confirming that there is a different approach toward the use of robotics between the two cultures.},

The project developed a system consisting of a robotic companion, Care-O-bot, as part of a smart environment. An intensive research was conducted to investigate and experiment with robot behaviours that trigger empathic exchanges between an older person and the robot. The paper is articulated in two parts. The first part illustrates the theory that inspired the development of a context-aware Graphical User Interface (GUI) used to interact with the robot. The GUI integrates an expressive mask allowing perspective taking with the aim to stimulate empathic exchanges. The second part focuses on the user evaluation, and reports the outcomes from three different tests. The results of the first two tests show a positive acceptance of the GUI by the older people. The final test reports qualitative comments by senior participants on the occurrence of empathic exchanges with the robot.},

 abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a research field whose main objective is to develop health monitoring systems for elderly patients at home, increasing the degree of patient independence during chronic diseases treatment. AAL systems are composed by several technologies: medical sensors and actuators, computer and mobile devices, Wireress Sensors Networks (WSN), computer networks, software infrastructure and applications. A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living. The main components of this software infrastructure are the M-Hub and the SDDL middleware. Preliminary results show that the proposed infrastructure has the potential to be applied in a wide range of health monitoring scenarios.},

 abstract = {According to statistics, one in every three adults ageing 65 or older falls every year. Every fall may lead to long-term consequences due to fractures or even neurological damages. These consequences have severe impact in their quality of life, independence and confidence, ultimately increasing the risk of early death. Moreover, the risk of falling increases as age advances. Fortunately, several studies reveal that specific exercise programmes may help in reducing the risk of falling if performed correctly and frequently. However, user engagement and adherence to these programmes are still low mainly due to motivational factors, since interventions are usually long, unadapted and unchallenging. In this paper, a new solution is presented, which uses the concept of interactive games using motion sensors to tackle low adherence (through gaming motivation) and help in physical rehabilitation and reduce fall risk on elderly people by improving balance, muscle strength and mobility. It is intended to be used in community or domestic unsupervised contexts and supports relatively inexpensive sensing equipment (currently Kinect®, Leap Motion®, Orbotix Sphero® and Smartphones) and common platforms (desktop and mobile). Tests were already undertaken with several individuals ageing 65 or more and the results were analysed and discussed, being generally positive, despite some issues in the movement detection algorithms.},

Our aims were to 1) examine attitudes to living with sensors and AAL technology over time; 2) gather opinions on the usefulness of this data for supporting self-management of health and wellbeing and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of various visualization techniques for presenting sensor-based health and wellness data. Our findings show that older adults are interested in receiving feedback from sensor technology to support them self-managing their wellbeing. Potential beneficial information includes time spent inside and outside the home, walking time, sleep, activity, blood pressure and weight. This information needs to be enhanced by education and goal-setting and by representing data using visualisations that are simple and intuitive.},

A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.},

To balance communication practices we integrated classic media based on pen and paper with online social networks. In this paper we present a 36 weeks deployment study with an extended family (n=12) of the use of Tlatosketch, a hybrid system based on a digital photo frame, and digital pen and paper technology. This combination allows older adults to stay updated on Facebook and to post paper notes to Facebook. Our results show that Tlatosketch provides the older adult with a new media for self-expression, and improves the family social experience, thus helping them remain active while ageing.

Field-tests with older adults (n=3) and user studies (n=9) were conducted to evaluate the system and the perceived usefulness of the system. A review of related work and the study findings show that (1) the perceived benefit for the older target group was very low. The main motivation for using the system was triggered by the perceived benefit for their closest informal caregivers; (2) Informal caregivers do not regularly seek help for themselves, and (3) Introducing a C4B-like system is more than solving hardware and usability issues. The study suggests that more flexibility in the organizational structure of formal care (in The Netherlands and beyond) is needed.},

The approach starts from the insight that the usage of smart watches for care-giving and handling personal health hazards is a best practice driven, empirical discipline, requiring a declarative, easy to maintain software description for the smart watch devices. The second rationale for the approach presented is the decomposition of the complex interrelations of "health hazards" into definable modules of manageable size, each addressing the handling an individual health hazard. The proposed, hierarchical architecture builds on the automatic detection of the activities and events of daily life (ADLs, EDLs) by the sensors of the smart watch. Handling of health hazards will be modeled by UML state machines, which utilize the detected ADL/EDLs for their state transitions. The architecture has to take account for a plenitude of relevant hazards, managed by a multitude of simultaneously operating state machines, via a central synchronizing control mechanism.},

 abstract = {With the advent of ubiquitous computing and sensor technologies, indoor trajectory data of individuals can readily be collected to support analysis of their underlying movement behaviors. Different methods for activity recognition have been proposed where supervised learning algorithms are often adopted. In many applications like elderly care, the behaviors to be characterized are often not known in a priori and the behaviors of different individuals cannot be assumed similar even for the same activity type. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning methodology to first extract from the trajectory data of an individual behavioral patterns as representations of his/her daily activities, and then infer the patterns' occurrence per day for daily routine analysis. Extracting behavioral patterns is challenging as the patterns often carry long-range dependency and appear with spatio-temporal variations, making the conventional frequent pattern mining approach not suitable. We propose to model the trajectory data using a behavior-aware flow graph which is a probabilistic finite state automaton where the nodes and edges are attributed with local behavioral features. We then apply the weighted kernel k-means algorithm to the flow graph to identify sub flows as the behavioral patterns, followed by non-negative matrix factorization to compute the daily routine patterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it to a publicly available data set that contains trajectories of an elder living in a smart home for 219 days. With reference to the ground truth, our experimental results show that the proposed flow graph allows more accurate activity-specific behavioral patterns to be extracted as compared to a frequent pattern clustering approach. Also, we illustrate how the proposed method can be used to support daily routine analysis.},

 abstract = {Power electronics are widely used in the transport and energy sectors. Hence, the reliability of these power electronic components is critical to reducing the maintenance cost of these assets. It is vital that the health of these components is monitored for increasing the safety and availability of a system. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostic technique for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of power electronic components. There is a need for an efficient prognostic algorithm that is embeddable and able to support on-board real-time decision-making. A time delay neural network (TDNN) is used in the development of failure modes for an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Initially, the time delay neural network is constructed from training IGBTs' ageing samples. A stochastic process is performed for the estimation results to compute the probability of the health state during the degradation process. The proposed TDNN fusion with a statistical approach benefits the probability distribution function by improving the accuracy of the results of the TDDN in RUL prediction. The RUL (i.e., mean and confidence bounds) is then calculated from the simulation of the estimated degradation states. The prognostic results are evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative accuracy (RA) prognostic evaluation metrics.},

 abstract = {Supporting healthy ageing through sustained physical fitness requires interventions that promote healthy levels of physical activity as part of daily life. Wearable devices, such as activity trackers are body-worn and may be seamlessly integrated into daily activities to promote fitness. Although wearables have been used by younger adopters to optimise physical fitness, little is known so far how these emerging technologies may be leveraged to enhance learning and improve well-being and fitness of seniors. In this paper we present a novel approach to designing Wearable Enhanced Learning (WELL) for healthy ageing as part of the R&D project “Fitness MOOC - interaction of seniors with wearable fitness trackers in the MOOC (fMOOC)”. The fMOOC project is a cooperation between Beuth University of Applied Sciences and the Geriatrics Research Group at Charité Berlin and aims at enhancing healthy ageing through an embodied learning experience in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with support of wearable activity trackers. This paper focuses on gamification designs in wearable enhanced learning for senior users and addresses the issue of user engagement.},

Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis.

 abstract = {Intelligent systems and smart devices have played the major role in improving the healthcare organisation in terms of continuous tele-monitoring therapy and maintaining telemedicine management system for sickle cell disease. The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required. A machine-learning algorithm was conducted to perform the classification process. Four experiments were carried out to classify sickle cell disease patients from normal patients using machine-learning algorithm in which 99.5984% classification accuracy was achieved using Multi-layer perceptron. Classification using Core Vector Regression, Hyper Pipes and Zero-Rule based algorithms achieved classification accuracy of 95.9839 %, 87.9518% and 70.6827 %, respectively.},

 abstract = {Wearable devices like activity tracker, measuring motion and steps, enable users to monitor their behaviour and might support a healthier lifestyle. These wearables might also motivate elderly to be active and live healthy. Unfortunately they are mostly designed for younger users and it is unclear if they are usable by older adults. In order to answer this research question a four week lasting empirical study was conducted regarding individual motivation and activity trackers' usability with 15 participants older than 60 years. During the first session, participants put the activity tracker into operation without further instructions while "thinkingaloud" and mental effort was measured. During the whole study participants used the activity tracker according their personal needs. Usability was measured by Post Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) three different times - during introduction session, middle session after two weeks and at the final session after four weeks. The added value as well as the necessity of an app was evaluated in a crossover design. Therefore, participants used the activity tracker two weeks with and two without app. Aspects concerning user requirements identified during interviews were weighted by a pairwise comparison at the final meeting. Results revealed elderlies' attitude towards usability, requirements, motivation, mental effort and technical affinity of activity tracker under field conditions. All in all activity trackers are accepted and motivating for elderlies as well as they have a suitable usability.},

 abstract = {Falls are behind many elderly hospitalizations and can lead to injuries that greatly debilitate old patients. Much of the deployed fall detection systems rely on the user wearing a personal emergency response device, being conscious and at home. The limitations of the existing systems regarding usability and efficiency have yield an overarching research question on whether systems based on new and advanced consumer mobile devices can be used as ubiquitous automatic fall detectors for seniors. This paper specifically looks into the accuracy of a fall detection system based on an off-the-shelf smartwatch and smartphone. We have implemented a system which combines threshold based and pattern recognition techniques in both devices, with the intent of having the watch to contribute to the specificity of the fall detection strategy. We tested the accuracy of the system through a series of simulated falls and activities of daily living, resulting on the correct identification of 63% of the falls and 78% of the activities and outperforming two other baseline fall detection applications (iFall and Fade). The sensors and algorithm on the watch were able to provide a marginal contribution to the system's accuracy. Indications from the tests suggest that it should be possible to improve the system accuracy by adjusting the used thresholds and fuzzyfying them. Moreover, it is expected that the open source nature of this work and it's results boost such threshold tuning and serve as a better basis for researchers to benchmark their work.},

 abstract = {The high development of medicine causes the world's population aging quickly. To resolve the problem with limited medical resources, constant monitoring of elders' activity of daily living is important. We propose an activity recognition system for smart home, so elders can live alone and their children can monitor their parents' living activity to achieve the concept of "Aging in Place". The living activity monitoring model is powerful to recognize meaningful activities by using both ambient and wearable sensors. It's feasible to deploy in the real living environment be-cause it's a non-parametric learning model. Elders need less effort to label activity in training part, and the model may have chance to find some special activities that the elders did not consider in the past. We demonstrate the living activity monitoring model is feasible to be deployed in a living home with high accuracy performance of the activity recognition result.},

 abstract = {Generally, post-stroke patients suffer physical disorder or paralysis in various level. Common treatment to restore the functionality of the paralyzed limb is by doing motoric therapy. This therapy was done in hospital and was monitored by therapists. However, most of the post-stroke patients choose not to do therapy since their access to hospital is difficult or their motivation to do therapy is low. To overcome the limitations of traditional therapy methods some interactive game-based therapy systems were introduced i.e: AR-therapy and Wii-based movement therapy. Unfortunately, their performance is low due to user ergonomic factor problem. In this study, we proposed a virtual reality system for sitting to standing and walking therapy for post-stroke patients called KOMY. This application is integrated with Kinect technology. Four VR game-based training tasks were adopted from sitting to standing therapy and walking therapy that was done by therapist. These tasks are sitting-standing-sitting, moving leg aside, moving leg freely, and walking. Each task has tree difficulty level. From observation that involving post-stroke patient, elderly healthy people, and therapist, we find that all of them give positive comment to this application. They said that this application not only can be used for therapy of post-stroke patients but also can be used for exercise to elderly. Further, KOMY can be used as alternative for playing therapy and home education therapy.},

In order to upgrade the standard of life of elderly people, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems are also widely deployed in the context of IoT applications. To preserve user security and privacy in AAL systems, it is significant to ensure secure communication link establishment among the medical devices and the remote hosts or servers that are interested in accessing the critical health data. However, due to the limited resources available in such constrained devices, it is challenging to exploit expensive cryptographic operations in the conventional security protocols. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel proxy-based authentication and key establishment protocol, which is lightweight and suitable to safeguard sensitive data generated by resource-constrained devices in IoT-enabled AAL systems.},

They are useful to identify most of the actions performed by the person while having a meal.

Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact between the integrated devices and diverse services. Considering the healthcare research, the number of elderly people is rapidly growing and they need more support in their life. Therefore, a new technology called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has been proposed to better increase the life quality of elderly people. In AAL, the devices are mostly connected wirelessly to each other and/or to a healthcare service centre. It is challenging to build such a system and its deployment should be seamless and flexible. Therefore, IoT provides all main characteristics necessary for AAL environment and applications, including heterogeneous devices. However, IoT devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory. Recently, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been established as a best communication paradigm for future internet, particularly in IoT. Based on hierarchically structured names, ICN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and provides an efficient and intelligent communication paradigm for both IoT and AAL (IoT-AAL) technologies. In this work, we design an IoT architecture for AAL via ICN approach which will effectively improve the performance of communication between the heterogeneous devices and services integrated in IoT-AAL.},

In this paper, a development methodology is proposed for building the kind of system that developer interacts and communicates directly with the components in the domain. The developer interacts with them in simulated or runtime context in order to instruct and shape the whole system. As a technique of Agent-Based Modeling, the entire system is considered to consist of interacting (semi-) autonomous agents that can reason, adapt, and learn at runtime. This approach of development requires a particular agent architecture that can reason and learn about human activity and social conditions comprising spatial, temporal, and hierarchical structure of information. In this paper, the teachable approach is exemplified using a simulated persuasive multi-agent system for elderly care in ageing-in-place domain.},

Since the primary traffic in WBAN is vital physiological signals, guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) is crucial while designing WBAN. However, QoS of WBAN will be degraded in strong inter-WBAN interference environment such as hospitals and senior communities, where WBANs are densely deployed. In this paper, by focusing on a more practical WBAN model, we propose a non- cooperative power control game to mitigate inter- WBAN interference, in which the cost function is well designed by considering both QoS requirement and energy constraint. The existence of at least one Nash equilibrium (NE) point for the game is proved and a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the NE is derived. To guarantee non-cooperative among WBANs, an interference segmentation estimate (ISE) algorithm is proposed to obtain an approximation of the NE point. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISE algorithm.},

Such applications have a strong tendency to integrate various types of existing devices. This trend is aligned with the ideas of ubiquitous computing, which is expected to turn devices increasingly independent of people, making the relationship between technologies more natural and intuitive. The different communication rotocols used by these devices target a specific segment, such as multimedia sharing, electronic security, home automation and healthcare. However, this variety increases the complexity of device integration and represents an obstacle to their development. This paper presents an architecture capable of providing compatible services that can be requested using heterogeneous protocols and is based on the fundamentals of the service-oriented architecture. The central component of this architecture is a middleware capable of abstracting requests of different protocols, facilitating dynamic composition of services distributed in heterogeneous LAN. The proposed architecture is detailed in this article. In addition, several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed middleware, in pursuit of their boundaries and aiming to validate the adopted technologies. As far as we know, our work is the first one that provides interoperation between the DLNA and DPWS technologies.},

All of these applications require monitoring of movements and physical activities for individuals. Wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based sensors can offer low-cost and ubiquitous monitoring solutions for physical activities.

 abstract = {Our society will face a notable demographic shift in the near future. According to a United Nations report, the ratio of the elderly population (aged 60 years or older) to the overall population increased from 9.2% in 1990 to 11.7% in 2013 and is expected to reach 21.1% by 2050 [1]. According to the same report, 40% of older people live independently in their own homes. This ratio is about 75% in the developed countries. These facts will result in many societal challenges as well as changes in the health-care system, such as an increase in diseases and health-care costs, a shortage of caregivers, and a rise in the number of individuals unable to live independently [2]. Thus, it is imperative to develop ambient intelligence-based assisted living (AL) tools that help elderly people live independently in their homes. The recent developments in sensor technology and decreasing sensor costs have made the deployment of various sensors in various combinations viable, including static setups as well as wearable sensors. This article presents a survey that concentrates on the signal processing methods employed with different types of sensors.

How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.},

 abstract = {Wearable self-powered medical devices have long been a goal of the medical community. The ability to constantly monitor the patient's vital signs for abnormalities, in addition to alerting first responders to immediate problems, would allow for more rapid medical treatment. As the population of the United States ages, low-cost and ubiquitous medical devices will improve the ability of medical personnel to diagnose potential health issues early, thus increasing the survival rate and decreasing the potential complications. Electrocardiograms are a major focus of the medical community due to the prevalence of heart issues among elderly Americans, and as the cost of sensors and wireless communication decreases, new devices are possible. This paper describes a Bluetooth-based, dry electrode electrocardiogram monitoring system seamlessly integrated into a T-shirt. The shirt used three dry silver-based electrodes to collect the ECG signal and streamed the resulting signal to an Android smartphone for analysis.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given. Nowadays many users can be involved willingly and monitored in a more or less intrusive manner with data collected in their homes. This data can be collected from mobile and wearable devices (such as smart phone and smart watch), from sensors disseminated in the home (such as motion detectors and contact switches) and from self-reported information systems (using paper based or web-based ecological momentary assessment techniques). This data can then be useful to characterize the activity, the health and the well-being of the involved person. Enabling people suffering (such as elderly people, people with physical disabilities and people with mental-health condition) to stay in their home as long as possible in good condition is an important challenge for many countries. Firstly, most of people would rather to continue to live in their own home rather than move to a nursing-home or an hospital, secondly the solutions enabling staying at home are also usually cheaper for the society. As a consequence Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) systems gain more and more attention. SHAAL systems use information and communication technologies in a person's daily living environment to enable them to stay active longer, remain socially connected and live independently. SHAAL's research covers a wide range of topics. This talk will review the main aspects of SHAAL systems from the data mining point of view. Several case studies will be illustrated. In particular it will emphasize the key role of activity learning and behavior understanding.},

For this purpose it is useful to monitor their vital signs and the home environment to activate suitable environment regulation and to send alarms to family members, medical, or hospitals, according to the criticality of the subject. The paper aims at proposing a flexible and reliable monitoring system based on embedded systems and wearable devices. The system main feature is that it allows the doctor and family members to monitor the patients at distance using their mobiles. A suitable communication with the first aid center is foreseen for a fast rescue of the patients in case of critical situations. A user model ontology is adopted so that patient and context data may be used by any diagnostic and first aid software, thus envisaging an open and interoperable health monitoring system for elderly people living at home. A diagnostic system based on fuzzy rules is proposed to support the choice of the best course of actions in case of critical health conditions.},

 abstract = {At DOMUS for the past 14 years, several cognitive orthotics were designed and implemented and evaluated, most of the time using participatory design. The resulting set of orthotics can support a wide variety of activities of daily living (ADL) to foster autonomy at home for people with cognitive impairments, e.g. medication, meal preparation, or budget. DOMUS benefits from a rich and versatile research infrastructure to design, implement, and evaluate such orthotics, namely a smart apartment on the campus, a living lab in an alternative housing unit for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), seniors' residences, personal residences (apartments and houses). To different extents, all these places can be considered as living labs. In this paper, building on our extensive experience, we first show that participative design is the best-suited methodology for developing cognitive orthotics in living labs. Clinical researchers, caregivers, and end users are involved from the start. This ensures that design is user driven and that assistive technologies will satisfy users needs. Then we propose a classification of living labs according to the levels of control one can have on which and how much technology is deployed, on how space is organized and how it may vary from experiment to experiment, and on how the progression and execution of a scenario can be constrained or not. For each category of living labs, we discuss their different yet complementary characteristics, highlighting their pros and cons. For instance, our smart apartment provides tight control over technology, space, and execution of predefined scenarios. Accordingly evaluations then provide a lot of useful and reliable information about technology and the ability for people to use it, but less on acceptance of the technology and its integration at one's real home in her daily life habits.},

Among existing systems, there is none robust system that can act as a bridge between different systems to facilitate knowledge sharing, so as to empower the detection and prediction capabilities of them. These systems cannot use the data and knowledge of other similar systems due to the complexity involved in sharing data between them. Storing the information is also a challenge due to a high volume of sensor data generated by each sensor. The proposed HEAL model is a platform that provides services to developers to leverage the previously processed similar data and the corresponding detected symptoms. The proposed architecture is cloud-based and provides services for input sensors, Internet of Things devices, and context providers. The ultimate goal of the system is to fill the gap between symptoms and diagnosis trend data in order to predict health anomalies accurately and quickly.},

 abstract = {The world senior population is projected to douDle as a percentage over the whole population in the next decades. In order to preserve or improve the quality of life of this population, as well as to keep healthcare costs sustainable, it is important to better support their ability of independent living. Cognitive decline is a major threat to independent living; it may be experienced in normal aging but it may also lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and more serious neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. Early detection of cognitive decline, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of its evolution for early intervention are a priority. Researchers have found that subtle differences in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) as well as the recognition of subtle errors while performing IADLs may be useful for MCI diagnosis as well as to differentiate different forms of cognitive disorders. However, occasionally performing ability tests in equipped rooms on medical premises has several shortcomings including cost and reliability of results. Pervasive computing coupled with intelligent data analysis can have a major role in this application domain by continuous monitoring of activities at home during daily life. This idea has been at the core of several recent research projects. The main challenges that we are facing are: a) reliability, unobtrusiveness and affordability of the sensor infrastructure, b) precision and robustness of techniques for IADL recognition, c) effectiveness of algorithms for recognizing fine-grained abnormal behaviors identified by clinicians as relevant indicators, d) identification of relevant patterns through long-term data analysis, e) privacy-awareness of data acquisition and management, f) effectiveness of visualization and interaction tools for clinicians. This talk will discuss the above challenges, report the experience on using hybrid statistical and knowledge-based techniques for addressing the recognition tasks, and - dentify critical aspects still to be investigated.},

Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

Such systems can provide information about non-movement or inactivity of the elderly resident. As prolonged inactivity could mean potential danger, several algorithms have been proposed to automatically detect unusually long durations of inactivity. Such schemes, however, suffer from low sensitivity due to their high detection latency. In this paper, we propose Dwell Time-enhanced Dynamic Threshold (DTDT), a scheme for computing adaptive alert thresholds that exploit region-specific dwell time to reduce the detection latency. Using extreme value theory, we obtain a closed form expression for the per-region alert thresholds. We perform simulations using real data to evaluate the performance of DTDT and compare it with state-of-the art schemes AID and the algorithm by Moshtaghi et al. Results show that DTDT shows significantly lower detection latency, 1.5-3 hours shorter, in regions with short dwell times (bathroom and kitchen) while maintaining the same false alarm rate.},

Taking a value-inspired design perspective, the study argues that service design for promoting aging-in-place needs to reconcile the values of both the elderly and caregivers. Drawn from the framework of basic human values and the unique experience of the SHINESeniors project, the study extracts the core values for elderly and caregivers using a multi-method case analysis. We suggest that both system and working protocols should be redesigned concurrently to maximize the benefits of the technology.

 abstract = {Healthcare is increasingly a collaborative effort involving caregivers from several different organizations providing services to the same patient. This is particularly the case in care for the elderly and chronically ill, where a preference for care in the home is common. Current systems lack support for care scenarios that require mobility and intra-organizational collaboration. This results in an inefficient work situation that relies on old technologies - paper notes, phones calls, fax - for communication, which ultimately threaten the medical safety of patients. In this paper we present a system designed for this collaborative situation covering both mobile work in a single organization (home care) and collaboration across organizations, as well as connecting devices to people. Although developed as part of a research project, the use of participatory design and iterative development has resulted in early adoption of the system which is now in professional use by both the participating hospital and municipality.},

 abstract = {The rapidly growing elderly population in many parts of the world has started to impact private and public interests - emotionally, socially and economically. Specifically, current demographics, medical and social trends in the U.S. indicate a large population of older adults being at risk of early cognitive impairment and dementia. This motivates us to design innovative technology solutions for cognitive health assessment, care and well-being in elderly people in their own environments of daily life. Among many significant challenges involved in such technology assisted solutions, an important one is multi-modal sensing and complex sensor data analytics on resource constrained wearable and regularly used daily objects, particularly in the presence of uncertainty and noisy environments. An additional critical challenge is how to transfer the extracted knowledge into actionable information to be effectively used by family members, doctors and caregivers. This keynote talk will present our ongoing research on elderly cognitive care with the help of complex at-home activities recognition with smart wearable, and user emotional behavior signatures detection with smart chair. For activity recognition, our innovative methodology is the first of its kind that detects 21 fine-grained and complex at-home activities by wearable devices, as compared to typical 6-12 at-home activities recognized by relevant works in the existing literature. The smart chair based novel framework can accurately detect user functional and emotional activities, in addition to static and movement based sedentary postures that are more common in current works. In collaboration with Phelps County Regional Medical Center, the proposed solutions are being validated with clinical data and patient studies.},

Growing concerns about the impact of concussions on student athletes has driven a decrease in sports participation. Mississippi faces unique challenges in providing access to education and health care in impoverished and medically underserved communities. The Heads in the Game outreach and research program was developed to motivate STEM education and empower students through their love of sports. Sixteen rising junior and senior scholars participated in a month-long program where they attended seminars on coding methodologies, biomedical and computer engineering, health and sports performance, concussion protocols and impact detection devices, applications in telemedicine, and principles and practices of scientific research methods. Heads in the Game scholars used the skills gained in order to perform research in student athlete healthcare. Scholars conducted interviews with athletic trainers, medical professionals, and coaches, and applied the skills learned in the seminars towards the development of a program for an improved athletics digital health information infrastructure. We objectively report the results of the student outreach process, seminars, research methods, research accomplishments, and how the scholars have applied what they learned in their communities. We also describe future plans for augmenting the developed curriculum with rural telemedicine and NASA's Human Research Program.},

There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/ abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information. This way the system could increase accessibility, efficiency, and also lower the health expenses to improve the comfort and safety as well as management of daily routines of an elderly life.},

 abstract = {Ambient Intelligence is a new paradigm in information technology to empower people. Such a paradigm that highlights human interaction with machines makes smart technologies a good candidate for development of various real-life solutions in the field of health care, including human activity recognition in smart homes. Since the description of user activity plays an important role in a smart environment, recognition and tracking user activities of daily living can provide unprecedented opportunities for health monitoring, applications, and assistive life utilities, particularly for the elderly, disabled, and people with dementia or Alzheimer disease. Due to sensor data nature with different sampling rates and complex correlations, significant challenges arise due to storage, presentation, exchange and manipulate of this data category. One rational solution to solve such challenges is to use techniques which are based on Semantic Web and Ontology. Recently there have been large varieties of proposed approaches in which they use such techniques. The vast amount of human activity recognition in smart home while using Ontological approaches has made it difficult to make adequate comparisons and accurate assessment. This article presents a framework for analyzing each of the approaches proposed in this regard. Using the proposed SOnAr framework for Ontology-based activity recognition approaches can be effective in analyzing and evaluating different methods in different application areas and dealing with various challenges.},

 abstract = {Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the typical movement disorder diseases, which has a serious impact on the daily lives of elderly people. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PD gait pattern recognition. The key idea of our approach is to distinguish PD gait patterns from healthy individuals by accurately extracting gait features that indicate three aspects of movement function, i.e., Stability, symmetry and harmony. Concretely, our framework contains three steps: gait phase discrimination, feature extraction and selection and pattern classification. In the first step, we put forward a key event based method to discriminate four gait phases from plantar pressure data. In the second step, based on the gait phases, we extract and select gait features that can indicate stability, symmetry and harmony of movement function. In the third step, we recognize PD gait pattern by employing BP neural network. We evaluate the framework using a real plantar pressure dataset that contains 93 PD patients and 72 healthy individuals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline approach by 32.7% on average in terms of Precision, 42.2% on average in terms of Recall, and 24.0% on average in terms of AUC.},

AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.},

When AAL applications are provided through the Internet, it is possible to create new applications involving the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The AAL-IoT applications can be used to event detection (such as fall detection or blood pressure) and send messages to an emergency service or a family member through the Internet. The event detection is frequently performed by sensor networks. However, these networks can present some difficulties to provide the high quality of service required for AAL-IoT applications. Thus, this paper proposes a new routing metric that considers information about the nodes and their connections, seeking the network performance enhancement for AAL-IoT. The proposed metric is an additive composition of information about link quality and nodes energy. The results obtained through simulation show that the proposed routing metric can increase the network performance to better meet the AAL-IoT requirements.},

While disruptions in cognition is a striking feature of dementia, it is also closely coupled with changes in functional and behavioral health of older adults. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of improving the automatic assessment of dementia, by better exploiting the emerging physiological sensors in conjunction with ambient sensors in a real field environment with IRB approval. We hypothesize that the cognitive health of older individuals can be estimated by tracking their daily activities and mental arousal states. We employ signal processing on wearable sensor data streams (e.g., Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), accelerometer (ACC)) and machine learning algorithms to assess cognitive impairments and its correlation with functional health decline. To validate our approach, we quantify the score of machine learning, survey and observation based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and signal processing based mental arousal state, respectively for functional and behavioral health measures among 17 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community in Baltimore. We compare clinically observed scores with technology guided automated scores using both machine learning and statistical techniques.},

 abstract = {Mobile smartphones have revolutionized the concept of mobile phones as different apps are built to offer various interesting applications in healthcare, gaming, etc. rather than using the phone only for voice services. The application developers take advantage of onboard sensors, web connectivity and powerful processing units of the smartphones to develop such interesting apps. In this paper, we present an interesting approach where direct acoustic coupling technique is employed to quickly and conveniently convert the smartphones into high quality digital stethoscope by using an ultra-low cost attachment. The design consideration primarily focused on affordability, simplicity and use-friendly aspects into account. The motivation of this work is to enable the heart patients to send their heart sound to doctor's chamber/ hospitals from their home instead of travelling all the way to hospitals/clinics. This is particularly useful in poor or developing countries where there is scarcity of healthcare centers and patients have to travel a long distance to visit the clinic. The situation becomes more serious in case of patients who went through heart surgery and requires follow up visits or for elderly population requiring routine checkups. For both the cases, in many instances, doctors primarily listen to the heart sound to prescribe further actions. Our solution can greatly help such situations and in many cases it can completely eliminate the travel. In addition, since data can also be recorded and saved, this opens up possibility for statistical analysis to further aid the diagnosis / monitoring. Thus, our solution can serve as a viable tool in connected health use cases for heart patients for needy geography.},

 abstract = {The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain aims to support the daily life activities of elders, patients with chronic conditions or disabled people, with a focus on ICT (Informatics and Communication Technologies). Important advances in AAL software systems have been already made, assisting people in their home, work, and social environments. Because of their critical nature, these systems must be developed focused on their quality. Hence, quality attributes (QAs), such as safety, reliability, and security, must be identified and well defined to successfully achieve the system purposes. However, there is not a set of QAs specific for AAL systems, hence, new systems have been developed based on general standards, such as ISO/IEC 25010, or based on particular experiences. This paper introduces the QM4AAL, a quality model (QM) for AAL systems. The QM4AAL was established and evaluated based on evidence from several published works found through conduction of a systematic mapping study. As result, the QM4AAL details QAs requirements, adaptive (e.g., self-configuring or situation-aware) or static properties, and stakeholders of AAL systems and their constituents systems (e.g., activity monitoring or health status monitoring systems). We intend this QM can orient the design and assessment of current and future AAL systems.},

 abstract = {Gait is emerging as a powerful tool to detect early disease and monitor progression across a number of pathologies. Typically quantitative gait assessment has been limited to specialised laboratory facilities. However, measuring gait in home and community settings may provide a more accurate reflection of gait performance because: (1) it will not be confounded by attention which may be heightened during formal testing; and (2) it allows performance to be captured over time. This work addresses the feasibility and challenges of measuring gait characteristics with a single accelerometer based wearable device during free-living activity. Moreover, it describes the current methodological and statistical processes required to quantify those sensitive surrogate markers for ageing and pathology. A unified framework for large scale analysis is proposed. We present data and workflows from healthy older adults and those with Parkinson's disease (PD) while presenting current algorithms and scope within modern pervasive healthcare. Our findings suggested that free-living conditions heighten between group differences showing greater sensitivity to PD, and provided encouraging results to support the use of the suggested framework for large clinical application.},

In this paper, an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) system has been designed in order to create better living conditions for older people. In this way, people can live independently longer in their own house with an improved quality of life. The proposed system includes several features. On the one hand, it is able to continuously monitor the health status of the elderly through data coming from heterogeneous sources (i.e., environmental sensors and medical devices). On the other hand, it is able to guarantee outdoor and indoor localization aimed to know the real-time position of the elderly both inside and outside their home. A remote reasoning system processes all collected data with the aim of generating appropriate events and alerts. The architecture was validated from a functional point of view through a proof-of-concept.},

 abstract = {Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a dual effect on human health. Low UV doses promote the photosynthesis of vitamin D and regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, while an excessive UV exposure is the main cause of skin cancer, along with eye diseases and premature skin ageing. Nevertheless, the link between UV radiation levels and UV exposure is not fully understood since exposure data are limited and individual anatomical variations in UV doses are significant. For these reasons, a numeric simulation tool (SimUVEx) has been developed and validated in order to predict the dose and distribution of UV exposure received taking into account postural information and ambient irradiation data. SimUVEx is based on 3D graphics techniques usually used to render virtual environments to estimate the exposure of a 3D virtual manikin characterised as a triangular mesh surface. Each triangle receives a certain quantity of solar energy depending on the direct, diffuse and reflected radiation, the body surface orientation to the sun and the shadows from other parts of the body. The goals of the second version of SimUVEx are to move from individual-based to population-based (e.g., Switzerland and, eventually, Europe) exposure assessment, expanding temporal, spatial and morphological simulation capabilities. Outputs from SimUVEx version 2 will allow building exposure scenarios, identifying high-risk situations and producing reference dose ranges for typical outdoor occupational and leisure activities.},

Firstly, Deficiency of medical personnel affects the quality of treatment, care and nursing. Secondly, many countries have been approaching a super-aged society. Proper policies are needed and applied to the elderly. Thirdly, current medical system lacks of preventive medicine application which efficiently prevents and relieves disease prevalence. Computer technology has been currently applied to several domains in order to yield better performance. Wearable devices have become usable and applicable to sense several vital signs and communicate them with other networked nodes via the Internet. In this paper, "UbiNurSS on Mobile - A Ubiquitous Nursing Support System on Mobile Devices" has been developed for nursing support. UbiNurSS employs available devices which are capable of measuring pulse which reflects pulse or heart rate and blood pressure. Mobile devices have also been used. UbiNurSS on Mobile consists of two sub-systems -- a mobile application which facilitates health monitoring and warning for both wearer and doctor, and a web application which facilitates the nurse's or caregiver's tasks at a nursing station or an ordinary dwelling. The heart rate report and corresponding warning can be generated in real-time. We demonstrate feasible applicability of UbiNurSS on Mobile in terms of users' satisfaction survey.},

Smart devices not only aid to people's life but also are becoming a crucial part of physically challenged and aged people. The need for safe and independent mobility for the elderly and physical challenged people is of prime concern. The paper deals with creation of a Smart Wheel-Chair (SWC) that mainly focuses on the mentioned issue in a very affordable way and to a greater extent. The Wheel-Chair is controlled by RTOS as its core operating system. It consists of a touch-screen based navigation system along with accident prevention and fall detection. A semi-automatic vision function, heart rate sensors and physiological stress sensors have been integrated. GPRS system is used for location determination and GSM is used to communicate in those cases where certain abnormal events like falling, accident or health issues are trigged. The real-time interaction functions are designed with the motive to make the user operating the wheel-chair completely self-dependent and his interaction with the environment can be like of a normal person.},

A standard software package is used by health authorities to store the results of the surveys. At present only one data file can be loaded into the dental survey program for analysis at any given time. Analysis of more than one data set at a time is therefore not possible. The overall aims of the collection of vast amounts of clinical data are many. Analysis of data sets containing both clinical and socio-economical data elements are of great interest to senior management of health authorities. The results of data analysis can aid in the planning and provision of dental resources in areas of identified need. To date no evidence is available to suggest that previous efforts to amalgamate and analyse the available epidemiological data have been made.

In Japan's rapidly aging society, many elderly patients who have lost mobility, speech, or memory live with their families. Although they do not necessarily need intense medical care, these patients require constant attention to ensure their safety. Broadband audio and video introduce a novel possibility for applying remote-monitoring technology to home healthcare. For example, various MPEG compression technologies can transmit high-quality audio-video via the Internet so that a family member can use an office PC or wireless mobile terminal to monitor a bedridden patient's image and vital signs while a caregiver runs errands. Using live audio and video streaming in this manner, however, raises privacy concerns. Transmitting unprotected audio-visual signals, compressed in a standard format, over the Internet carries the risk that someone can monitor these transmissions, whether accidentally or intentionally},

@article{pmid10231825,
 abstract = {The health implications of atmospheric particulate matter have become a topic of much interest on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially in the USA, where they were at the centre of the debate over the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard in 1997. Much of this debate revolves around claims that particulate matter (usually represented by PM10) in the atmosphere directly influences mortality, hospital admissions with respiratory diseases, and so on. In this paper, we take a critical look at one of these issues, the influence of PM10 on deaths in the elderly population. Two data sets are considered, one from Birmingham (Alabama) and the other from Chicago. In both cases we find a significant PM10-mortality relationship in some of the models fitted, but not in others. Other issues considered include the existence of a threshold below which PM10 has no discernible influence, the interaction with other pollutants and the mortality displacement or harvesting effect (the theory that the direct effect of PM10 is limited to a very small subset of the population who are already critically ill and whose death is only advanced by a few hours or days as a result of air pollution). Overall, our conclusion is that there are too many uncertain issues to allow us to make definitive statements about a causal relationship between PM10 and mortality.},

 abstract = {Until the 1960s, pain was considered an inevitable sensory response to tissue damage. There was little room for the affective dimension of this ubiquitous experience, and none whatsoever for the effects of genetic differences, past experience, anxiety, or expectation. In recent years, great advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie pain and in the treatment of people who complain of pain. The roles of factors outside the patient's body have also been clarified. Pain is probably the most common symptomatic reason to seek medical consultation. All of us have headaches, burns, cuts, and other pains at some time during childhood and adult life. Individuals who undergo surgery are almost certain to have postoperative pain. Ageing is also associated with an increased likelihood of chronic pain. Health-care expenditures for chronic pain are enormous, rivalled only by the costs of wage replacement and welfare programmes for those who do not work because of pain. Despite improved knowledge of underlying mechanisms and better treatments, many people who have chronic pain receive inadequate care.},

 abstract = {There is little evidence of systematic negative bias against older patients in medical visits. The nature of the current narrative review, largely based on studies conducted after 1985, is consistent with the author's previous metaanalysis of over 40 studies published between 1965 and 1985. In that review, based on videotapes or audiotapes of medical visits, consistent relationships between patient age and physicians' interviewing skills were found. Older patients received more information, more total communication and questions concerning drugs, more courtesy, and perhaps more formality reflected in less laughter and joking than younger patients. Ultimately, the subtle ageism that may be present in medical visits with older patients is probably balanced somewhat by communication advantages afforded them challenging the negative views of older patients' care prevalent in the literature. This balance may help explain the ubiquitous finding that older patients are more satisfied with their health care, despite poorer health status, than younger patients. Nevertheless, other patients, especially those in the oldest cohorts, are at high risk for passive relationships and communication complications related to low literacy and poor health status and deserve the attention and special consideration of providers and health service researchers.},

Measurements of PM and other criteria air pollutants were made inside selected individual residences within the retirement facility and at a central outdoor site on the premises. In addition, personal PM exposure monitoring was conducted for a subset of the participants, and ambient PM monitoring data were available for comparison from the NERL PM research monitoring platform in central Fresno. Both a winter (February 1-28, 1999) and a spring (April 19-May 16, 1999) study were completed so that seasonal effects could be evaluated. During the spring study, a more robust personal exposure component was added, as well as a more detailed evaluation of physical factors, such as air-exchange rate, that are known to influence the penetration of particles into the indoor environment. In this paper, comparisons are made among measured personal PM exposures and PM mass concentrations measured at the NERL Fresno Platform site, outside on the premises of the retirement facility, and inside selected residential apartments at the facility during the two 28-day study periods. The arithmetic daily mean personal PM2.5 exposure during the winter study period was 13.3 micrograms/m3, compared with 9.7, 20.5, and 21.7 micrograms/m3 for daily mean overall apartment, outdoor, and ambient (i.e., platform) concentrations, respectively. The daily mean personal PM2.5 exposure during the spring study period was 11.1 micrograms/m3, compared with 8.0, 10.1, and 8.6 micrograms/m3 for the daily mean apartment, outdoor, and ambient concentrations, respectively.},

The study design incorporated repeated individual 24-h integrated PM2.5 personal exposure monitoring. A total of 325 PM2.5 personal exposure samples were obtained during a 28-day study period using a subject pool of 21 elderly (65+ years of age) residents of an 18-story retirement facility near Baltimore, Maryland. Each sample represented a unique 24-h breathing zone measurement of PM2.5 mass concentration. PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations collected from the apartments of the subjects as well as residential and ambient sites were compared to individual and mean PM2.5 personal exposures. Daily PM2.5 personal exposure concentrations ranged from 2.4 to 47.8 microg/m3 with an overall individual study mean of 12.9 microg/m3. Mean PM2.5 personal exposures were determined to be highly correlated to those representing the central indoor (r=0.90) and ambient sites (r=0.89). Subjects reported spending an average of 92% of each day within the confines of the retirement center. Based upon measured and modeled exposures, a mean PM2.5 personal cloud of 3.1 microg/m3 was estimated. Data collected from these participants may be unique with respect to the general elderly population due to the communal lifestyle within the facility and reported low frequency of exposure to sources of PM.},

In the present article, the specific application of resources activation in psychotherapy for old-age depression is particularly emphasized and attempts at defining the concept of resources as well as hints towards the discovery of resources are explored. Contrary to earlier assumptions that ageing is a deficiency process, it has now been shown that despite evident losses in various life areas in aging, some resources can be defined which can be decisive for a sense of well-being among the elderly and for prophylaxis or therapy of old-age depression. Procedures and resource activation with content must be activated in parallel with problem actualization so that feelings of self-esteem and well-being increase, problems are solved and experiences of loss due to ageing are compensated. One of the most important resources among the elderly has proved to be the ability to accommodate and the social network. Group therapy as an effective and economical form of therapy as well as the therapeutic relationship itself can be employed as resources to promote social interaction among the aged.},

 abstract = {A strong and consistent association has been observed between adjusted mortality rates and ambient particle concentration. The strongest associations are seen for respiratory and cardiac deaths, particularly among the elderly. Particulate air pollution is also associated with asthma exacerbations, increased respiratory symptoms, decreased lung function, increased medication use, and increased hospital admissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently promulgated a new national ambient air quality standard for fine particles, and yet the mechanisms for health effects at such low particle mass concentrations remain unclear. Hypotheses to identify the responsible particles have focused on particle acidity, particle content of transition metals, bioaerosols, and ultrafine particles. Because ultrafine particles are efficiently deposited in the respiratory tract and may be important in initiating airway inflammation, we have initiated clinical studies with ultrafine carbon particles in healthy subjects. These studies examine the role of ultrafines in: (1) the induction of airway inflammation; (2) expression of leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules in blood; (3) the alteration of blood coagulability; and (4) alteration in cardiac electrical activity. These events could lead to exacerbation of underlying cardiorespiratory disease. For example, airway inflammation may activate endothelium and circulating leukocytes, and induce a systemic acute phase response with transient hypercoagulability; this could explain the epidemiologic linkages between pollutant exposures and cardiovascular events. These approaches should be useful in identifying mechanisms for pollutant-induced respiratory and systemic effects, and in providing data for determining appropriate air quality standards.},

 abstract = {Influenza infection has been a burden to humans for thousands of years. Despite the fact that epidemics could be predicted with regularity, the lack of available prevention or treatment measures left humankind vulnerable to the harmful effects of this ubiquitous virus. While the pandemics of 1918 and 1957 are recent examples of the devastation that influenza may inflict, even in a typical year influenza infection and related complications cause significant morbidity and mortality. The development of an influenza vaccine during the 1940s marked a major turning point in the management of this disease. Vaccination of the elderly and other high risk patients has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to be a worthwhile investment from an economic perspective. Despite these benefits, vaccine use in this group remains suboptimal. The role of annual vaccination for individuals at lower risk for influenza-related complications remains controversial. While prevention by vaccination is relatively straightforward, the treatment of symptomatic influenza-like illness with medication is more complicated. Differentiating symptoms caused by the influenza viruses from those caused by other common viruses is difficult. Currently available tests to document influenza as the cause of illness are either too expensive, too inaccurate or too time consuming to impact treatment. Symptom-based diagnosis remains the most commonly used strategy in clinical practice. The approval of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs)--zanamivir and oseltamivir--remind healthcare providers of the difficulties in diagnosing and treating influenza. NIs have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of individuals infected with influenza when prescribed within the first 2 days of symptoms. Whether these innovative agents are cost effective, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the benefits that these agents may offer above and beyond existing therapies. In this review, we examine the burden of influenza infection, diagnostic challenges and the clinical and economic impact of available interventions. Clinical controversies and potential areas for further investigation are also explored.},

Increased hospitalization (a measure of morbidity) among the elderly for specific causes has also been associated with PM. These studies have raised concerns about public health effects of particulate air pollution and have contributed to regulatory decisions in the United States. However, scientists have pointed out uncertainties that raise questions about the interpretation of these studies. One limitation to previous time-series studies of PM and adverse health effects is that the evidence for an association is derived from studies conducted in single locations using diverse analytic methods. Statistical procedures have been used to combine the results of these single location studies in order to produce a summary estimate of the health effects of PM. Difficulties with this approach include the process by which cities were selected to be studied, the different analytic methods applied to each single study, and the variety of methods used to measure or account for variables included in the analysis. These individual studies were also not able to account for the effects of gaseous air pollutants in a systematic manner.},

 abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine whether variations in concentrations of particulates in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, during the period 1984 to 1993, were associated with daily variations in cause-specific daily mortality. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfate was also measured daily (1986-1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec). We used coefficient of haze (COH), extinction coefficient, and sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine particles for days that were missing. We estimated associations between cause-specific mortality and PM(2.5), PM(10), predicted fine particles and fine sulfate particles, total suspended particles, coefficient of haze, extinction coefficient, and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station. We selected a set of underlying causes of death, as recorded on the death certificates, as the endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and gaseous pollutants. We found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from respiratory diseases and diabetes. The mean percentage change in daily mortality (MPC), evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day of death and the preceding 2 days, for deaths from respiratory diseases was MPC(COH)=6.90% (95% CI: 3.69-10.21%), MPC(Predicted PM2.5)= 9.03% (95% CI: 5.83- 12.33%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.64% (95% CI: 2.46-6.86%). For diabetes, the corresponding estimates were MPC(COH)=7.50% (95% CI: 1.96-13.34%), MPC(Predicted PM2.5)=7.59% (95% CI: 2.36-13.09%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.48% (95% CI: 1.08-7.99%). Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death, we found consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and coronary artery diseases. Associations with sulfate mass were also found among elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer. These associations were consistent with linear relationships. The associations found for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases, especially in the elderly, are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by which ambient particles may increase daily mortality. The positive associations found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis proposed by Frank and Tankersley, who suggested that persons in failing health may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating physiological set points. The association with diabetes may be interpreted in light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology. Further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted.},

In Germany 1.2 million evaluations per year are done by the experts of the medical review boards of the health insurance funds. As a part of those evaluations the experts also have to discuss the necessity of any kind of rehabilitation procedures. In 1999 according to the experts' opinion only about 12% of the patients need such special support. At first this number seems much too low. We discuss the problems in that social field: Does the demand of the social welfare legislation "prevention and rehabilitation instead of nursing care" not correspond to the real needs or are the circumstances of social policy and medical supply responsible for that low recommendation of rehabilitation programs. This discussion leads to the following consequences: The patients, the members of their family but also the treating physicians must be informed much better than today about diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for the special diseases of elderly people. All in the game have to prepare concepts, pilot projects and then common solutions for geriatric rehabilitation programs as soon as possible. Politicians, physicians, nursing staff, rehabilitation staff, patients, family members and any other caregivers all have to take responsibility, maybe the liability. Not only German people will be growing older than ever before, which everyone has to recognize as one of the most important facts of our welfare state. To handle this development will be the most serious duty of our community in the future. Therefore, geriatrics has to receive high public attention.},

In life and in death, health care costs are expensive, and while society often views older people as too expensive to take care of alive, their death can be even more costly. For patients of all ages, death under the influence of technology is more expensive than life, yet it is geriatric intensive care medicine that grabs society's economic attention.

 abstract = {We present the results of the Air Pollution and Health: A European Approach 2 (APHEA2) project on short-term effects of ambient particles on mortality with emphasis on effect modification. We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 microg/m3 increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 microg/m3 in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics.},

This goal has not yet been achieved worldwide; however in England and Wales tetanus in neonates and young women has been extremely rare for the last 50 years. We can attribute the success in eliminating tetanus in the UK to the adoption of highly effective preventative measures as we know that the causative organism is still ubiquitous in the environment. This article outlines how we have achieved the elimination of tetanus in the UK through the development and introduction of appropriately targeted immunisation, combined with an appreciation of the importance of adequate wound toilet measures. The discovery of tetanus toxoid and its applicability for vaccination has been of great benefit and the new challenges which we face relate to the introduction of new multi-component vaccines and how we might better protect the elderly. In other parts of the world, for the cost of a few pence, one dose of tetanus toxoid can still mean the difference between life and death.},

 abstract = {Well-documented air pollution episodes throughout recent history have led to deaths among individuals with cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Although the components of air pollution that cause the adverse health effects in these individuals are unknown, a small proportion by mass but a large proportion by number of the ambient air particles are ultrafine, i.e., less than 100 nm in diameter. This ultrafine component of particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microm (PM(10) may mediate some of the adverse health effects reported in epidemiologic studies and for which there is toxicologic evidence to support this contention. The exact mechanism by which ultrafine particles have adverse effects is unknown, but these particles have recently been shown to enhance calcium influx on contact with macrophages. Oxidative stress is also to be anticipated at the huge particle surface; this can be augmented by oxidants generated by recruited inflammatory leukocytes. Atheromatous plaques form in the coronary arteries and are major causes of morbidity and death associated epidemiologically with particulate air pollution. In populations exposed to air pollution episodes, blood viscosity, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were higher. More recently, increases in heart rate in response to rising air pollution have been described and are most marked in individuals who have high blood viscosity. In our study of elderly individuals, there were significant rises in CRP, an index of inflammation. In this present review, we consider the likely interactions between the ultrafine particles the acute phase response and cardiovascular disease.},

As the concept of clinical pathway for patient care is a relatively new concept in Singapore, several critical factors must be considered to ensure successful implementation of clinical pathway/case management programme. One key success factor lies in continued clinician support and acceptance. Other factors include top management leadership and support and a dedicated team of case managers, nurses and paramedical professionals.},

Aim of the study was to assess whether these instruments identify different subsets of subjects with alcohol problems. Of the 649 participants, 19.1% were at-risk drinkers (average intake > 40 g/day in men and > 20 g/day in women). Both the screening instruments were positive in only a minority of participants. Of the 377 drinkers, 53 gave > or =1 affirmative response to the CAGE questionnaire, whereas 24 had a positive MCV-gammaGT test. The concordance between positive CAGE questionnaire and MCV-gammaGT test was limited to seven subjects (kappa = 0.10), and these tests identified subjects who differed for several health and psychosocial characteristics. Participants aged > or =75 years drank less, but had similar prevalence of CAGE and MCV-gammaGT positive markers as compared to younger participants. In conclusion, excessive drinking is common in the elderly. Screening tests based on behavioral and biological markers identify two different sets of subjects with possible alcohol problems. This might indicate the opportunity to use these instruments in conjunction.},

Weekly readings were taken, and may have failed to give an accurate record in those observed for 4 weeks or less, though here 56% of the 154 fatalities had low nosetip temperatures. A longer-stay group consisted of 177 cases, of whom 155 had low nosetip temperatures at some time. 87 patients in this group died, 43 remained disabled and only 25 regained their previous state of health. It is concluded that low nosetip temperatures provide a useful indicator that adequate recovery is unlikely to occur.},

Data collected at outdoor sites at the homes of participants of a large exposure assessment study were used in this study. Harvard impactors (HIs) were used at 40 outdoor sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area. Up to six sites at a time were monitored for 10 consecutive 24-hr average periods. A fixed-effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included date and location effects was used to analyze the spatial variability of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Both date and location effects were shown to be highly significant, explaining 92% of the variability in outdoor PM2.5 measurements. The day-to-day variability was 10 times higher than the spatial variability between sites. The site mean square was more than twice the error mean square, showing that differences between sites, while modest, are potentially an important contribution to measurement error. Variances of the model residuals and site effects were examined against spatial characteristics of the monitoring sites. The spatial characteristics included elevation, distance from arterials, and distance from major PM2.5 point sources. Results showed that the most representative PM2.5 sites were located at elevations of 80-120 m above sea level, and at distances of 100-300 m from the nearest arterial road. Location relative to industrial PM2.5 sources is not a significant predictor of residential outdoor PM2.5 measurements. Additionally, for sites to be representative of the average population exposures to PM2.5 among those highly susceptible to the health effects of PM2.5, areas of high elderly population density were considered. These representative spatial characteristics were used as multiple, overlapping criteria in a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to determine where the most representative sites are located.},

 abstract = {Because microorganisms are easily dispersed, display physiological diversity, and tolerate extreme conditions, they are ubiquitous and may contaminate and grow in water. The presence of waterborne enteric pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) in domestic water supplies represents a potentially significant human health risk. Even though major outbreaks of waterborne disease are comparatively rare, there is substantial evidence that human enteric pathogens that are frequently present in domestic water supplies are responsible for low-level incidence of waterborne microbial disease. Although these diseases are rarely debilitating to healthy adults for more than a few hours to a few days, enteric pathogens can cause severe illness, even death, for young children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems. As the epidemiology of waterborne diseases is changing, there is a growing global public health concern about new and reemerging infectious diseases that are occurring through a complex interaction of social, economic, evolutionary, and ecological factors. New microbial pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. Alternative testing strategies for waterborne diseases should significantly improve the ability to detect and control the causative pathogenic agents. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of waterborne microbial pathogens, their detection, and the future of new methods in controlling these infectious agents.},

Discussed briefly are the implications of these duties for nursing programs when disabled students are treated less favourably than their peers such as through a failure to make reasonable adjustments within the curriculum. Part IV of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995), as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (2001), identifies such statutory duties and rights for nursing programs. For the purpose of this article, access to nursing education by disabled students and the subsequent service provision for these students in nursing programs is described as a game, using a conceptual framework by North. Different roles identified within the formal and informal legal rules, such as attitudes toward disabled students in nursing programs throughout the UK, are discussed briefly using this framework. It is noted that the rules of the game very much mirror the rules under Part II and Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) relating to disabled employees and disabled service users of public services, in force since December 1996. It is argued that lecturers and senior management teams in both nursing education and the health services occupy historical roles in the efficient design and playing of this game. The next step is to gradually align informal rules with formal rules, which can only be done through proper and correct education of key players.},

Targeting sadness and loneliness for an intervention addresses both primary risk reduction for depressive disorders and promotion of overall mental health in the elderly. Nevertheless, few studies document the efficacy of primary prevention efforts in preventing depressive disorders in the elderly. The author argues that the attainment of positive mental health depends in considerable part upon an individual's self-efficacy--the belief that one can organize and execute the courses of action required to develop and enhance a person's belief that he or she can act in ways that lead to a desired goal. Self-efficacy is strengthened, not by some general or abstract instruction, but rather by the experience of successfully dealing with and thus overcoming specific problems. The extant literature suggests that many potential approaches may be available to develop and enhance self-efficacy in the elderly--approaches that potentially could be broadly applicable in community settings.},

From November 1999 to February 2000, 70 pharmacies, uniformly located throughout the Campania region of southern Italy, distributed a questionnaire to purchasers of over-the-counter laxatives. The average age of the (mostly female) respondents was 45.9 years; 23.8% were elderly. Among the 7324 individuals who completed the survey, 77.6% selected an oral product; 22.4% preferred rectal administration. A physician influenced the choice of a laxative in 37.7% of the cases, a pharmacist in 20.5%; other suggestions came from relatives (14%), acquaintances (12.1%), advertisements (11.7%), and miscellaneous sources (4%). Only 59.8% of respondents used these drugs correctly, and 58.2% consulted a physician or pharmacist because of constipation. Adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, occurred in 6.1% of those surveyed. The long-term use or abuse of laxatives can cause serious medical consequences, as well as mask diseases, delaying diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Physicians, pharmacists, and other health-care personnel should counsel patients on the proper use of these easily available, ubiquitous drugs.},

 abstract = {Stereotypes of an asexual old age remain pervasive, shaping not only popular images of older people, but also research and policy agendas. However, older people's own attitudes towards the role and value of sex in later life remain relatively unexplored. This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative data to examine how sex is prioritised in middle age and later life. Data collection methods involved completion of two quality of life measures (WHOQOL-100 and WHOQOL Importance Scale), followed by semi-structured interviews. In total the sample comprised 69 individuals recruited from the age/sex register of a general practice in Sheffield in the UK. This paper will focus upon the accounts of 21 men and 23 women aged 50-92 years. Ratings of the importance of sex to participants were gathered from the WHOQOL Importance Scale; the in-depth interviews enabled the basis for this prioritisation to be explored. Analysis identified the following key themes. Participants who did not consider sex to be of any importance to them neither had a current sexual partner, nor felt that they would have another sexual partner in their lifetime. Indeed, all participants who had a current sexual partner attributed at least some importance to sex, with many rating sex as 'very' or 'extremely' important. However, experiencing barriers to being sexually active led them to place less importance on sex; this was particularly apparent when health problems and widowhood were experienced. Age was seen as facilitating coping when sex became less frequent, or stopped altogether. This was explained in terms of sexual desire decreasing with age (for some male participants), the cessation of sex being easier to cope with in a relationship of long duration and the expectation that sex will become less possible with 'normal ageing'. The discussion considers the implications of these findings for this developing field.},

At each study center, a panel of elderly subjects with coronary heart disease recorded cardiac and respiratory symptoms in a diary. Exposure to ambient air pollution was characterized by measuring daily mass concentrations of particles smaller than 10 micro m (PM(10)) and 2.5 micro m (PM(2.5)), number concentrations of ultrafine particles (NC(0.01-0.1)), and gases. Odds ratios for the relation of symptoms to air pollution, adjusted for time trend, respiratory infections, and meteorologic variables, were mostly homogeneous across the centers. No association was found between air pollution and chest pain. A 10- micro g/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) was positively associated with the incidence of shortness of breath (odds ratio (OR) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.24) and with avoidance of activities (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.22).

 abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are responsible for around 20% of all deaths worldwide (approximately 14 million) and are the principal cause of death in all developed countries, accounting for 50% of all deaths. Variations in the annual per capita death rates in different countries are well documented. Less well known are seasonal variations in death rates, with the highest levels occurring during the colder winter months, which have been described in many countries. This phenomenon is referred to as excess winter mortality. CVD-related deaths account for the majority of excess winter deaths (up to 70% in some countries), while about half of the remaining are due to increases in respiratory diseases. Paradoxically, CVD mortality increases to a greater extent with a given fall in temperature in regions with warm winters. While much of the indirect evidence points to the notion that cold is somehow involved in explaining excess winter deaths, the mechanism by which seemingly mild exposure to cold ambient conditions can increase the risk of death remains unclear. The strong indirect epidemiological evidence coupling cold climate to mortality may be related to indoor rather than outdoor climatic conditions (e.g., cold/damp houses versus warm/dry houses) coupled with a plethora of factors including health status, ageing-related deterioration in physiological and behavioral thermoregulation, toxicology, and socioeconomic factors.},

Daily measurements for particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM10) and black smoke (BS), as well as the daily number of deaths among persons > or = 65 yrs of age, from 29 European cities, have been collected. Data on other pollutants and meteorological variables, to adjust for confounding effects and data on city characteristics, to investigate potential effect modification, were also recorded. For individual city analysis, generalised additive models extending Poisson regression, using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) smoother to control for seasonal effects, were applied. To combine individual city results and explore effect modification, second stage regression models were applied. The per cent increase (95% confidence intervals), associated with a 10 microg x m(-3) increase in PM10, in the elderly daily number of deaths was 0.8%, (0.7-0.9%) and the corresponding number for BS was 0.6%, (0.5-0.8%). The effect size was modified by the long-term average levels of nitrogen dioxide (higher levels were associated with larger effects), temperature (larger effects were observed in warmer countries), and by the proportion of the elderly in each city (a larger proportion was associated with higher effects). These results indicate that ambient particles have effects on mortality among the elderly, with relative risks comparable or slightly higher than those observed for total mortality and similar effect modification patterns. The effects among the older persons are of particular importance, since the attributable number of events will be much larger, compared to the number of deaths among the younger population.},

 abstract = {During recent years an increasing focus has been directed towards the adverse health effects associated with ambient air pollution. Elderly people appear to be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects involving the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, resulting in symptoms, exacerbations of disease and even mortality. From an epidemiological point of view it is essential to obtain a more detailed description and identification of factors associated with these health effects. Novel study designs are needed with complementary exposure and biomedical characterisation. Long-term prospective studies are required. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms is considered important and requires an interaction between epidemiological and mechanistic studies in elderly individuals with or without complementary diseases that put in them especially at risk. Generally a synergy between complementary disciplines is warranted to move this important research area forward, also including in vitro models of cell responses in the elderly, animal models of diseases of the elderly, together with controlled air pollution exposure studies identifying health-related events and mechanisms. The generation of an understanding of air pollution effects in the elderly, at an elevated level, is a prerequisite to substantially reducing the adverse health effects of this population group. At local, national and European Union levels, some steps have been taken to support the research in this area. A major focus on the adverse air pollution effects in the elderly requires a long-term commitment that still remains to be established.},

This article suggests a potential hypothesis for these epidemiologic observations. Oxygen (O2) is transported, in reversible combination with hemoglobin, from the lungs to the tissues, where it diffuses into cardiac myocytes. Within the myocyte a portion of the O2 diffuses directly to the mitochondria, while the remaining O2 is transported by facilitated diffusion bound to myoglobin, a heme protein found in muscle. Within the mitochondria, O2 reacts to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high-energy phosphate compound that provides energy for all cell functions. Accordingly, the sustained production of ATP depends on the continuous delivery of O2 to the mitochondria, and failure at any point in the O2 transport system will compromise ATP production and myocardial function. Myoglobin, a fundamental constituent of cardiac muscle is essential for delivering O2 to the mitochondria. Myoglobin concentrations in cardiac tissue were 50% lower in patients with heart failure than in patients dying from noncardiac causes. Myoglobin concentrations are also severely depressed in animal models of congestive heart failure. Consequently, the role of myoglobin as a cellular transporter of O2 is seriously impaired by heart disease. Carbon monoxide reduces O2 transport to the tissues and, within the tissues, binds with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin (COMb). Thus, in cardiac patients CO further exacerbates the disease-related loss of myoglobin function. This further disrupts O2 transport and promotes adverse consequences for the compromised heart. Moreover, during hypoxia CO has the propensity of leaving the blood and binding with myoglobin in the intracellular compartment. Elderly persons with preexisting cardiopulmonary disorders appear to be at maximum risk of harmful health effects due to ambient air pollution exposure. Many of these disorders result in generalized or regional hypoxia. It is reasonable to hypothesize that CO also moves out of the blood of these patients and into the heart tissue whenever they are under hypoxic stress, such as exercise. Accordingly, CO binds with the marginal myoglobin concentrations present in the hearts of cardiac patients and further compromises cardiac function, resulting in poor tolerance of activity. Therefore, reduced cardiac myoglobin in people with heart disease, further exacerbated by CO moving into the cardiac tissue during episodes of hypoxia, may account for the positive association between ambient CO concentrations and hospitalization for heart disease.},

 abstract = {Daily measures of maximum temperature, particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micro m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and gaseous pollution (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide) were collected in Denver, Colorado, in July and August between 1993 and 1997. We then compared these exposures with concurrent data on the number of daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in men and women > 65 years of age. Generalized linear models, assuming a Poisson error structure for the selected cardiovascular disease hospital admissions, were constructed to evaluate the associations with air pollution and temperature. After adjusting the admission data for yearly trends, day-of-week effects, ambient maximum temperature, and dew point temperature, we studied the associations of the pollutants in single-pollutant models with lag times of 0-4 days. The results suggest that O3 is associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, and pulmonary heart disease. SO2 appears to be related to increased hospital stays for cardiac dysrhythmias, and CO is significantly associated with congestive heart failure. No association was found between particulate matter or NO2 and any of the health outcomes. Males tend to have higher numbers of hospital admissions than do females for all of the selected cardiovascular diseases, except for congestive heart failure. Higher temperatures appear to be an important factor in increasing the frequency of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and are associated with a decrease in the frequency of visits for coronary atherosclerosis and pulmonary heart disease.},

 abstract = {The objective of this project was to describe geriatric care provided under Medicare-risk contracts in HMOs with established Medicare programs. These findings provided the basis for an invitational workshop, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to formulate a research agenda for geriatric care in HMOs. The case study method involved site visits to seven HMOs by a physician with expertise in geriatrics, a managed care specialist, and a program development specialist. Representatives from the HMOs included senior executive officials, physicians recognized for providing and promoting geriatric care, research and program development staff, and various clinical staff including pharmacists, geriatric nurse practitioners, nurses, and social workers. The most frequently encountered geriatric care programs were categorized by the following six objectives: (1) identifying high risk patients, (2) assessing multi-problem patients, (3) treating multi-problem patients, (4) rehabilitating patients following acute events, (5) reducing medication problems, and (6) providing long-term care and home health care. Unique programs identified from these site visits included screening methods for new enrollees, approaches to comprehensive geriatric assessment, use of skilled nursing facilities for intensive rehabilitation and postacute care, and drug profiling and review. Utilization of geriatric nurse specialists and programs aimed at coordination with social services were pervasive in many of these HMOs. Workshop participants proposed several research and demonstration projects in all six areas. Overall consensus emerged that HMOs with Medicare-risk contracts provide a valuable setting for experimentation in geriatric care. Given the current health policy emphasis on managed care and capitated payment methodologies, geriatric care research in HMOs should be a high priority.},

 abstract = {In western countries, heart disease is the main cause of premature death. Most of cardiac deaths occur out of hospital. Because of a continuously growing elderly population, the number of heart attacks is steadily increasing. Symptoms are often interpreted incorrectly. Victims do not survive long enough to benefit from inhospital treatments. To reduce the time before treatment, the only useful diagnostic tool to assess the presence of a cardiac event is the electrocardiogram (ECG). Event and transtelephonic ECG recorders are used to improve decision-making but require setting up new infrastructures. The pervasive solution proposed by the European EPI-MEDICS project is an intelligent Personal ECG Monitor for the early detection of cardiac events. It includes part of the patient electronic health record (EHR), embeds a web server and decision-making techniques, generates different alarm levels and forwards alarm messages to the relevant care providers by means of new generation wireless communication. It is cost saving, involving care providers only if necessary, without requiring to set-up specific infrastructures. Healthcare becomes personalized, wearable and ubiquitous.},

Data for elderly patients from the health insurance system of Manitoba were used to construct an index that divided physicians into four groups based on their propensity to admit patients to the hospital. I then determined whether physicians who are more prone to admit patients use hospitals for more discretionary purposes and admit patients who are less ill. Although the differences between physicians with different practice styles were in the expected direction, the most compelling finding was the similarity in characteristics of patients admitted by physicians with markedly different practice styles. Such findings suggest a very wide latitude in physicians' decisions to admit patients; this latitude is not well captured by a model that posits a logical relationship between physician treatment patterns and patient need.},

 abstract = {We investigated whether the association of daily mortality and ambient ozone differs by age and area social conditions of the region of residence using a time-series analysis. The study setting was metropolitan Mexico City, a high altitude city situated in a valley, with an estimated 20 million inhabitants, large socioeconomic gradients, and ozone levels frequently exceeding international standards. We stratified daily deaths by six census-derived socioeconomic indicators, based on characteristics of the county where decedents lived. We used Poisson regression to model the association between daily mortality and ozone levels (on the day of death and the previous day) in separate models, stratified by area socioeconomic level and age, and controlling for time trends and temperature. Ozone was positively associated with total mortality [0.65% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02%, 1.28%] and for mortality among those over age 65 [1.39% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.51%, 2.28%]. Associations between ozone and all-age mortality did not show any consistent patterns according to socioeconomic gradients. We conclude that elderly people are at higher risk for ozone-associated mortality. Though county-level social indicators in Mexico City were not strong markers of vulnerability to ozone-associated acute mortality in this analysis, complex associations between individual and area-level factors may exist that would require additional data and further analyses to elucidate.},

The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Ageism is a pervasive problem throughout society. It is rooted in language, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and policies. Aging profoundly influences physiology, challenging the medical community to accommodate but not discriminate. The elderly are at an increased risk of disease and disability. Sixty percent of cancer occurs in people aged 65 and older, and the population is aging. The treatment of cancer in the elderly is complicated by comorbidities and other physiological factors, particularly renal, bone marrow, and metabolic reserve. Caregivers have to treat patients in a manner that optimizes treatment and avoids anticipated harm. However, the caregiver is often faced with situations where they must balance their personal beliefs, professional values, and knowledge of medicine with their patients' preferences and needs. Discussion in the Rounds focused on age bias, drug toxicity, life prolongation, and symptom relief, with the role of the caregiver, and the relationship to the patient, being pivotal.},

 abstract = {Ambient particulate pollution is associated with adverse health effects in epidemiological studies of the elderly with cardiopulmonary diseases. We hypothesize that ultrafine particles (UFP) contribute to these effects, especially when they are freshly generated and occur at high number concentrations. Studies to determine adverse effects have been performed using laboratory-generated surrogates, diluted exhaust from stationary engines, or concentrated ambient UFPs. Methodological difficulties exist with such experiments, and questions remain about how well these particles model those found in ambient air. Freshly generated UFPs are present at high concentrations on highways and vehicle passengers are directly exposed to them. We wished to expose rats to these UFPs to test their potential to cause effects. Since such exposures have not been done before, one objective of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of an on-road exposure study. Secondly, we wished to determine if there are significant exposure-related effects in aged, compromised rats. Old rats (21-mo F-344) were exposed directly on highways to either the aerosol (<1 microm)/gas phase, gas phase only, or filtered air using an on-road exposure system. Some rats were pretreated with a low dose of inhaled endotoxin or with instilled influenza virus to induce lung inflammation. The exposures in compartmentalized whole-body chambers consisted of 6-h driving periods on I-90 between Rochester and Buffalo once or 3 days in a row. Endpoints related to lung inflammation, inflammatory cell activation, and acute-phase responses were measured after exposure. The on-road exposure system did not affect measured endpoints in filtered air-exposed rats, indicating that it was well tolerated by them. We observed the expected increases in response (inflammation, inflammatory cell activation) to the priming agents. We also found a significant particle-associated increase in plasma endothelin-2, suggesting alterations in vascular endothelial cell activation. In addition, we observed main effects of particles related to the acute-phase response and inflammatory-cell activation. Interactions between on-road particles and the priming agents were also found. These results suggest that exposures to on-road particle mixtures have effects on the pulmonary and cardiovascular system in compromised, old rats. Furthermore, they demonstrate that on-road exposures are feasible and could be performed in future studies with more continuous particle exposures.},

 abstract = {The elderly and individuals who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be sensitive to particulate matter (PM) air pollution. We evaluated short-term health responses of 13 elderly volunteers with COPD and 6 age-matched healthy adults to controlled exposures of ambient PM pollution in suburban Los Angeles. Using a Harvard particle concentrator and a whole-body chamber, we exposed each person on separate occasions to approximately 200 microg/m(3) concentrated ambient particles (CAP) less than 2.5 mum in diameter and to filtered air (FA). Each exposure lasted 2 h with intermittent mild exercise. We found no significant effects of CAP on symptoms, spirometry, or induced sputum. A significant negative effect of CAP on arterial oxygenation (measured by pulse oximetry) immediately postexposure was more pronounced in healthy subjects. Peripheral blood basophils increased after CAP in healthy but not in COPD subjects. In both groups, red cell counts increased slightly 1 day after exposure to FA but not to CAP. Preexposure ectopic heartbeats were infrequent in healthy subjects, but increased modestly during/after CAP exposure relative to FA. Ectopic beats were more frequent in COPD subjects, but decreased modestly during/after CAP relative to FA. Heart-rate variability over multi-hour intervals was lower after CAP than after FA in healthy elderly subjects but not in COPD subjects. Thus, in this initial small-scale study of older volunteers experimentally exposed to ambient PM, some acute cardiopulmonary responses were consistent with effects reported from epidemiologic studies. Unexpectedly, individuals with COPD appeared less susceptible than healthy elderly individuals. Further investigation of older adults is warranted to understand the pathophysiology and public health significance of these findings.},

 abstract = {Seasonal changes in ambient temperature and day length are thought to modify habitual physical activity. However, relationships between such environmental factors and the daily physical activity of older populations remain unclear. The present study thus examined associations between meteorological variables and the number of steps taken per day by elderly Japanese. Continuous pedometer counts over a 450-day period were collected from 41 healthy subjects (age 71+/-4 years), none of whom engaged in any specific occupational activity or exercise programs. An electronic physical activity monitor was attached to a belt worn on the left side of the body throughout the day. Daily values for mean ambient temperature, duration of bright sunshine, mean wind speed, mean relative humidity, and precipitation were obtained from local meteorological stations. The day length was calculated from times of sunrise and sunset. Based on the entire group of 41 subjects (ensemble average), a subject's step count per day decreased exponentially with increasing precipitation (r2=0.19, P<0.05). On days when precipitation was <1 mm, the step count increased with the mean ambient temperature over the range of -2 to 17 degrees C, but decreased over the range 17-29 degrees C. The daily step count also tended to increase with day length, but the regression coefficient of determination attributable to step count and mean ambient temperature (r2=0.32, P<0.05) exceeded that linking the step count and day length (r2=0.13, P<0.05). The influence of other meteorological factors was small (r2<or=0.03) and of little practical significance. On days when precipitation is <1 mm, physical activity is associated more strongly with ambient temperature than with day length, duration of bright sunshine, wind speed, or relative humidity. Our findings have practical implications for health promotion efforts designed to increase the physical activity of elderly people consistently in the face of seasonal variations in environmental conditions.},

 abstract = {In this article we identify the magnitude of general and susceptible populations within the northeastern United States that would benefit from compliance with alternative U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annual and 24-hr mass-based standards for particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm (PM2.5). Understanding the scale of susceptibility in relation to the stringency or protectiveness of PM standards is important to achieving the public health protection required by the Clean Air Act of 1970. Evaluative tools are therefore necessary to place into regulatory context available health and monitoring data appropriate to the current review of the PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Within the New England, New Jersey, and New York study area, 38% of the total population are < 18 or > or =65 years of age, 4-18% of adults have cardiopulmonary or diabetes health conditions, 12-15% of children have respiratory allergies or lifetime asthma, and 72% of all persons (across child, adult, and elderly age groups) live in densely populated urban areas with elevated PM2.5 concentrations likely creating heightened exposure scenarios. The analysis combined a number of data sets to show that compliance with a range of alternative annual and 24-hr PM2.5 standard groupings would affect a large fraction of the total population in the Northeast. This work finds that current PM2.5 standards in the eight-state study area affect only 16% of the general population, who live in counties that do not meet the existing annual/24-hr standard of 15/65 microg/m3. More protective PM2.5 standards recommended or enacted by California and Canada would protect 84-100% of the Northeast population. Standards falling within current ranges recommended by the U.S. EPA would protect 29-100% of the Northeast population. These considerations suggest that the size of general and susceptible populations affected by the stringency of alternative PM standards has broad implications for risk management and direct bearing on the U.S. EPA's current NAAQS review and implementation.},

 abstract = {Particulate air pollution has been related with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that an increase in particulate matter (PM)(2.5) ambient concentrations was associated with a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) in the elderly with cardiovascular conditions, which could increase the risk of death. In order to assess if this association could also be observed in young adults, we studied 40 young healthy residents of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) who underwent 13 h Holter electrocardiographic and PM(2.5) personal monitoring. HRV was evaluated in time domain: the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals larger than 50 ms (pNN50). In multivariate analysis with mixed effects models, a significant negative association of pNN50 with PM(2.5) accumulative exposure was found. An increase in 30 microg/m(3) of the average PM(2.5) personal exposure in the previous 2 h decreased the pNN50 in 0.08% (P=0.01). This observation revealed an acute effect related to environmental exposure to PM(2.5) with regard to HRV in normal youngsters. The long-term health consequences of this association in young healthy adults remain to be clarified.},

 abstract = {The adverse health effects associated with ambient air pollution have triggered epidemiologists, toxicologists and chemists to combine their experience to investigate the toxicity of ambient PM (particulate matter) from European sites with differing traffic intensity, in order to increase the understanding of the role of fine and coarse PM, the role of chemical characteristics and relate that to health effects. Under the European Union 5th Framework Programme (FP5), the HEPMEAP, RAIAP and PAMCHAR projects have utilised high-volume samplers to collect PM in European locations with contrasting PM sources and performed a range of different laboratory investigations. The PM investigated generally induced significant biological responses, with both coarse (2.5-10 microm) and fine (0.1-2.5 microm) PM being able to induce toxic effects. The chemical composition of the PM (also reflecting the differences in the emission-source contribution) has been suggested to play an important role in these responses. Oxidative and immune effects have been demonstrated in several in vitro and animal models. Investigations have also given support for the assumption that asthmatic and elderly subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be more susceptible to PM exposure.},

 abstract = {There has been increasing awareness in recent years of the adverse cardiovascular effects of ambient air pollution. The recent publication of a statement from the Expert Panel on Population and Prevention Science of the American Heart Association has highlighted this issue. It has been appreciated for several decades that major pollution episodes, such as that associated with the London Fog of 1952, are responsible for increased numbers of deaths and most of these are due to cardiorespiratory causes. Realisation of this prompted government and environmental health initiatives to reduce emissions through establishing air quality standards. Previously, the major sources of air pollution were related to domestic coal burning and industry. However, the pattern of emissions in modern developed countries has changed, resulting in a pollution mixture of different composition to that on which early air quality standards were based. Even current 'lower' levels of air pollution have been shown consistently to be associated with adverse health effects. Over the past two decades, a wealth of epidemiological studies have considered both long- and short-term health effects of air pollution. Although the relative risk of respiratory disease in relation to air pollution exposure seems to be higher than that of cardiovascular disease, the latter are of greater absolute significance in population terms. A number of hypotheses have been proposed in order to explain the observed associations, and recent research efforts have focused on examining the mechanisms underlying the effects. It is suggested that certain subgroups of the population such as the elderly or those with pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease may be more susceptible to the effects of air pollution, and analysis of survival data from cohort studies supports this observation.},

 abstract = {Fine particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in long-term mortality in selected cohort studies, and this association has been influential in the establishment of air quality regulations for fine particles (PM(2.5)). However, this epidemiologic evidence has been questioned because of methodological issues, conflicting findings, and lack of an accepted causal mechanism. To further evaluate this association, the long-term relation between fine particulate air pollution and total mortality was examined in a cohort of 49, 975 elderly Californians, with a mean age of 65 yr as of 1973. These subjects, who resided in 25 California counties, were enrolled in 1959, recontacted in 1972, and followed from 1973 through 2002; 39, 846 deaths were identified. Proportional hazards regression models were used to determine their relative risk of death (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) during 1973-2002 by county of residence. The models adjusted for age, sex, cigarette smoking, race, education, marital status, body mass index, occupational exposure, exercise, and a dietary factor. For the 35, 789 subjects residing in 11 of these counties, county-wide exposure to fine particles was estimated from outdoor ambient concentrations measured during 1979-1983 and RRs were calculated as a function of these PM(2.5) levels (mean of 23.4 microg/m(3)). For the initial period, 1973-1982, a small positive risk was found: RR was 1.04 (1.01-1.07) for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5). For the subsequent period, 1983-2002, this risk was no longer present: RR was 1.00 (0.98-1.02). For the entire follow-up period, RR was 1.01 (0.99-1.03). The RRs varied somewhat among major subgroups defined by sex, age, education level, smoking status, and health status. None of the subgroups that had significantly elevated RRs during 1973-1982 had significantly elevated RRs during 1983-2002. The RRs showed no substantial variation by county of residence during any of the three follow-up periods. Subjects in the two counties with the highest PM(2.5) levels (mean of 36.1 microg/m(3)) had no greater risk of death than those in the two counties with the lowest PM(2.5) levels (mean of 13.1 microg/m(3)). These epidemiologic results do not support a current relationship between fine particulate pollution and total mortality in elderly Californians, but they do not rule out a small effect, particularly before 1983.},

Some scientists and regulators suggest that 2.5 microm might be an arbitrary cutoff and that the effects might be more pronounced for PM less than 0.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine PM). Our first aim was to determine the relation between size of respirable particles and particle toxicity, as well as the health effects of short-term increases (spikes) in particle concentration against backgrounds of relatively low or high baseline exposures. Our second aim was to determine the effect of spikes in concentration of fine particles (0.7 microm in mass median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD]) and ultrafine particles (35 nm in count median diameter [CMD]) of disparate composition: vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and carbon black. The relative toxicity of these particles was determined in aged rats with mild pulmonary inflammation induced by instilled endotoxin. Our third aim was to determine the influence of age (aged vs young adult) on particle-induced toxicity in these rats.},

 abstract = {Inhaled aerosol drugs commonly used by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators, as well as corticosteroids. These agents are available in a variety of inhaler devices, which include metered-dose inhalers (MDI), breath-actuated MDIs, nebulizers, and, currently, 5 different models of dry powder inhaler (DPI). There is evidence to suggest that multiple inhaler types cause confusion among patients and increase errors in patient use. Problems with MDIs include failure to coordinate inhalation with actuation of the MDI, inadequate breath-hold, and inappropriately fast inspiratory flow. Lack of a dose counter makes determining the number of remaining doses in an MDI problematic. Patient misuse of MDIs is compounded by lack of knowledge of correct use among health-care professionals. Several factors often seen with elderly patients have been identified as predictive of incorrect use of MDIs. These include mental-state scores, hand strength, and ideomotor dyspraxia. Holding chambers and spacers are partially intended to reduce the need for inhalation-actuation coordination with MDI use. However, such add-on devices can be subject to incorrect assembly. Possible delays between MDI actuation and inhalation, rapid inspiration, chamber electrostatic charge, and firing multiple puffs into the chamber can all reduce the availability of inhaled drug. Because they are breath-actuated, DPIs remove the need for inhalation-actuation synchrony, but there is evidence that patient errors in use of DPIs may be similar to those with MDIs. One of the biggest problems is loading and priming the DPI for use, and this may be due to the fact that every DPI model in current use is different. Medical personnel's knowledge of correct DPI use has also been shown to be lacking. The optimum inhalation profiles are different for the various DPIs, but, generally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients have been shown to achieve a minimum therapeutic dose, although the inhaled amount may be suboptimal. A limitation of DPIs that have multidose powder reservoirs (eg, the Turbuhaler) is ambient humidity, which can reduce the released dose. Small-volume nebulizers are limited by bulk, treatment time, and variable performance, but are easy for patients to use. Important features identified by patients for an ideal inhaler are ease of use during an attack, dose counter, and general ease of use and learning. A breath-actuated-pMDI, such as the Autohaler, ranked at the top of inhaler preference in a study of 100 patients with airflow obstruction, compared to DPIs and MDIs. Short of a universal simple inhaler, patient and caregiver education remains the best solution to correct patient errors in use.},

To represent the ambient urban air pollution, stations had to be sufficiently correlated (i.e., correlation >0.70) and to have sufficiently similar mean levels of pollution. Linear regression was used to model the association between concentrations of particles (PM10) and systolic blood pressure. We observed associations between the fifth lag hour and systolic blood pressure for an increase of 10 microg/m3 of PM10 (beta = -1.12, 95% confidence interval: [-1.90; -0.30]).

Effective mitigation of the health effects requires identification of the most harmful PM sources. The objective of our study was to evaluate relative effects of fine PM [aerodynamic diameter<or=2.5 microm (PM2.5)] from different sources on exercise-induced ischemia. We collected daily outdoor PM2.5 samples between autumn 1998 and spring 1999 in Helsinki, Finland. The mass of PM2.5 was apportioned between five sources. Forty-five elderly nonsmoking persons with stable coronary heart disease visited a clinic biweekly for submaximal exercise testing, during which the occurrence of ST segment depressions was recorded. Levels of PM2.5 originating from local traffic and long-range transport were associated with ST segment depressions>0.1 mV, with odds ratios at 2-day lag of 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.97] and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.20) per 1 microg/m3, respectively. In multipollutant models, where we used indicator elements for sources instead of source-specific PM2.5, only absorbance (elemental carbon), an indicator of local traffic and other combustion, was associated with ST segment depressions. Our results suggest that the PM fraction originating from combustion processes, notably traffic, exacerbates ischemic heart diseases associated with PM mass.},

Washington, DC has long been considered a non-healthy place to live according to the American Lung Association due to its poor air quality. This recognition clearly includes the negative PM-related human health effects within the region. Specifically, DC fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microm] poses notable health risks to subpopulations having an annual mean value of 16.70 microg/m(3) during the years 1999-2004, exceeding the EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 15 microg/m(3). Incessant exposure to significant levels of PM has previously been linked to deleterious health effects, such as heart and lung diseases. The environmental quality and public health statistics of Washington, DC indicate the need for higher-resolution measurements of emissions, both spatially and temporally, and increased analysis of PM-related health effects. Our findings show that there are significant risks of ward-specific pediatric asthma emergency room visits (ERV). Results also illustrate lifetime excess lung cancer risks, exceeding the 1 x 10(-6) threshold for the measured levels of particulate matter and heavy metals (chromium and arsenic) on behalf of numerous subpopulations in the DC selected wards.},

The problem is framed by providing an overview of the AL industry and reviewing AL resident demographics and health status characteristics. The discussion section examines the pervasive involvement of physicians with AL residents, reviews professional position statements on health care in AL, and reviews the emerging AL-focused clinical literature. In conclusion, the paper proposes key elements of a research agenda including establishing baseline physician-AL activity levels, physician collaboration with mid-level practitioners, and exploring physician involvement in chronic care and health promotion in AL.},

In working with self-neglect cases, ethical issues are often raised that challenge all professionals. Professional and family's wishes to remove obstacles to the wellbeing of an elderly may be directly in opposition to the individual's wishes. The core of many ethical dilemmas resides in the question of the individual decision-making capacity. Issues surrounding decision-making capacity are complex with many confounding factors. Through case-discussion, fundamental ethical issues of decision-making capacity relating to self-neglect will be explored and strategies will be offered to resolve these dilemmas.},

In this study, we conducted an analysis of data on repeated respiratory hospitalizations among the elderly in Vancouver, Canada, for the period of June 1, 1995, to March 31, 1999, using a new method proposed by (Dewanji and Moolgavkar 2000, 2002) for recurrent events, and compared it with some traditional methods. In particular, we assessed the impact of ambient gaseous (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) and particulate pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, and PM10-2.5) as well as the coefficient of haze (CoH) on recurrent respiratory hospital admissions. Using the new procedure, significant associations were found between admissions and 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day moving averages of the ambient SO2 concentrations, with the strongest association observed at the 7-day lag (RR = 1.044, 95% CI: 1.018-1.070). We also found PM10-2.5 for 3-day and 5-day lag to be significant, with the strongest association at 5-day lag (RR = 1.020, 95% CI: 1.001-1.039). No significant associations with admission were found with current day exposure.},

 abstract = {Three years ago, consultants Laurence Prusak and Thomas H. Davenport asked prominent management thinkers to name their gurus and reported the results in HBR. James G. March appeared on more lists than any other person except Peter Drucker. A professor emeritus in management, sociology, political science, and education at Stanford University, March has taught courses in subjects as diverse as organizational psychology, behavioral economics, leadership, rules for killing people, friendship, computer simulation, and statistics. He is perhaps best known for his pioneering contributions to organization and management theory. March's accomplishments in that field, and in many others, have conferred on him an almost unprecedented reputation as a rigorous scholar and a deep source of wisdom. As University of Chicago professor John Padgett wrote in the journal Contemporary Sociology, "March's influence, unlike that of any of his peers, is not limited to any possible subset of the social science disciplines; it is pervasive." March approaches thought aesthetically; he cares that ideas have "some form of elegance or grace or surprise." His poetic sensibility can be felt in the metaphors he has created over the years--the "garbage can theory" of organizational choice, for instance, and the "hot-stove effect" in learning. In this edited interview with HBR senior editor Diane Coutu, March shares his thinking on aesthetics, leadership, the role of folly, and the irrelevance of relevance when it comes to the pursuit of ideas. He also comments on the fundamental differences between academic and experiential knowledge, underscoring the need for both.},

 abstract = {HEARTFAID is a research and development project aimed at devising, developing and validating an innovative knowledge based platform of services, able to improve early diagnosis and to make more effective the medical-clinical management of heart diseases within elderly population. Chronic Heart Failure is one of the most remarkable health problems for prevalence and morbidity, especially in the developed western countries, with a strong impact in terms of social and economic effects. All these aspects are typically emphasized within the elderly population, with very frequent hospital admissions and a significant increase of medical costs. Recent studies and experiences have demonstrated that accurate heart failure management programs, based on a suitable integration of inpatient and outpatient clinical procedures, might prevent and reduce hospital admissions, improving clinical status and reducing costs. HEARTFAID aims at defining efficient and effective health care delivery organization and management models for the "optimal" management of the care in the field of cardiovascular diseases. The HEARTFAID innovative computerized system will improve the processes of diagnosis, prognosis and therapy provision, providing the following services: * electronic health record for easy and ubiquitous access to heterogeneous patients data;* integrated services for healthcare professionals, including patient telemonitoring, signal and image processing, alert and alarm system;* clinical decision support in the heart failure domain, based on pattern recognition in historical data, knowledge discovery analysis and inferences on patients' clinical data.The formalization of the pre-existing clinical knowledge and the discovery of new elicited knowledge represent the core of the HEARTFAID platform.},

The resulting imbalance between demand and skilled resources is beginning to force radical change towards a fully "joined up" cross-disciplinary, cross-agency service that spans the wide spectrum of medical and social care. This paper offers a basis for a radically revised model that combines end-to-end service processes optimization; the use of integrated assistive technology systems to help the elderly maintain an independent lifestyle; personal risk reduction through medical and status monitoring; extended care-watch and service co-ordination. It then develops an IPTV based approach to provide the necessary infrastructure to underpin provision of these facilities both at home and in the community. These substantial benefits are reviewed and weighed against the inherent loss of privacy that can result from the pervasive computing aspects of the care watch approach, together with the trust building and change management aspects that are inevitably involved in the rationalisation process.},

A survey of the current literature reveals that recent technological advances have been made in the fields of "telecare and home-monitoring", "smart homes and robotics" and "health information systems and knowledge management". Innovative technologies such as wearable devices, bio- and environmental sensors and mobile, humanoid robots do already exist and ambient assistant living environments are being created for an ageing society. However, those technologies have to be adapted to older people's self-care processes and coping strategies, and to support new ways of healthcare delivery. Medical informatics can support this process by providing the necessary information infrastructure, contribute to standardisation, interoperability and security issues and provide modelling and simulation techniques for educational purposes. Research fields of increasing importance with regard to an ageing society are, moreover, the fields of knowledge management, ubiquitous computing and human-computer interaction.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological studies associate ambient particulate pollution with adverse health outcomes in elderly individuals with cardiopulmonary diseases. We hypothesized that freshly generated ultrafine particles (UFP) contribute to these effects, as they are present in high number concentrations on highways and vehicle passengers are exposed directly to them. Aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (9-12 mo) with implanted radiotelemetry devices were exposed to highway aerosol or filtered, gas-denuded (clean) air using an on-road exposure system to examine effects on heart rate (HR) and heart-rate variability (HRV). On the day of exposure, rats were pretreated with low-dose inhaled or injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate respiratory tract or systemic inflammation, respectively. Exposures (6 h) in compartmentalized whole-body chambers were performed in an air conditioned compartment of a mobile laboratory on I-90 between Rochester and Buffalo, NY. HRV parameters were calculated from telemetric blood pressure signals and analyzed for the baseline period and for the first 32 h postexposure. The aerosol size (count median diameter = 15-20 nm; geometric standard deviation = 1.4-4.3) and number concentration (1.95-5.62 x 105/cm3) indicated the predominance of UFP. Intraperitoneal LPS significantly affected all of the parameters in a time-dependent manner; response patterns after inhaled or injected LPS pretreatment were similar, but more prolonged and greater in LPS-injected rats. A significant effect of highway aerosol was found, irrespective of pretreatment, which resulted in decreased HR in comparison to clean air-exposed rats. This effect was more persistent ( approximately 14 h) in those rats that received ip LPS as compared to saline. The highway aerosol also significantly affected short-term alterations in autonomic control of HR, as evidenced by elevations in normalized high frequency power and decreased vagosympathetic balance. These findings show that environmental exposure concentrations of mixed traffic-related UFP/gas-phase emissions can affect the autonomic nervous system.},

 abstract = {In light of future challenges, such as growing numbers of elderly, increase in chronic diseases, insufficient health care budgets and problems with staff recruitment for the health-care sector, information and communication technology (ICT) becomes a possible means to meet these challenges. Organizational changes such as the decentralization of the health-care system lead to a shift from in-hospital to both advanced and basic home health care. Advanced medical technologies provide solutions for distant home care in form of specialist consultations and home monitoring. Furthermore, the shift towards home health care will increase mobile work and the establishment of shared care teams which require ICT-based solutions that support ubiquitous information access and cooperative work. Clinical documentation and decision support systems are the main ICT-based solutions of interest in the context of ubiquitous computing for shared care environments. This paper therefore describes the prerequisites for clinical documentation and decision support at the point of care, the impact of mobility on the documentation process, and how the introduction of ICT-based solutions will influence organizations and people. Furthermore, the role of dentistry in shared-care environments is discussed and illustrated in the form of a future scenario.},

Interview data were examined to identify factors that might be considered as risk factors in psychosocial problems. Ten variables distinguished children with psychosocial problems. These variables were classified by the discriminant analysis technique, by order of importance as effort done, housing conditions, nature of the work, substance intake, educational status, degree of job satisfaction, income, nutrition, age and occupation. These variables correctly classified 100% of the affected group and misclassified 13.3% of the non affected group.

However, little is known about which sources of particulate matter contribute most to the adverse health effects. Identification of responsible sources would merit more efficient control. For a 6-year period (01 January 1999 to 31 December 2004), we examined associations between urban background PM(10) in the presence of gaseous pollutants (CO, NO(2)) and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease in the elderly (age>/=65), and asthma in children (age 5-18) in Copenhagen, Denmark. We further studied associations between fractions of PM(10) assigned to six sources (biomass, secondary, oil, crustal, sea salt, and vehicle) and admissions during a 1(1/2) -year campaign. We used Poisson generalized additive time-series model adjusted for season, day of the week, public holidays, influenza epidemics, grass pollen, school holidays, and meteorology, with up to 5 days lagged air pollution exposure. We found positive associations between PM(10) and the three health outcomes, with strongest associations for asthma. The PM(10) effect remained robust in the presence of CO and NO(2). We found different PM(10) sources to be variably associated with different outcomes: crustal and secondary sources showed strongest associations with cardiovascular, biomass with respiratory, and vehicle with asthma admissions. These novel results may merit future research of potential mechanism, whereas at present, no single PM(10) source can be attributed to all morbidity.},

People over the age of 75 are at risk for medically related cognitive decline and confusion, and the early detection of cognitive problems would allow for more effective clinical intervention. However, standard cognitive assessments are not diagnostically sensitive and are performed infrequently. To address these issues, we have developed a set of adaptive computer games to monitor cognitive performance in a home environment. Assessment algorithms for various aspects of cognition are embedded in the games. The monitoring of these metrics allows us to detect within subject trends over time, providing a method for the early detection of cognitive decline. In addition, the real-time information on cognitive state is used to adapt the user interface to the needs of the individual user. In this paper we describe the software architecture and methodology for monitoring cognitive performance using data from natural computer interactions in a home setting.},

 abstract = {A variety of ambient exposure indicators have been used to evaluate the impact of high temperature on mortality and in the identification of susceptible population sub-groups, but no study has evaluated how airport and city centre temperatures differ in their association with mortality during summer. This study considers the differences in temperatures measured at the airport and in the city centre of three Italian cities (Milan, Rome and Turin) and investigates the impact of these measures on daily mortality. The case-crossover design was applied to evaluate the association between daily mean apparent temperature (MAT) and daily total mortality. The analysis was conducted for the entire population and for subgroups defined by demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status and chronic comorbidity (based on hospitalisation during the preceding 2 years). The percentage risk of dying, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), on a day with MAT at the 95th percentile with respect to the 25th percentile of the June-September daily distribution was estimated. Airport and city-centre temperature distributions, which vary among cities and between stations, have a heterogeneous impact on mortality. Milan was the city with the greatest differences in mean MAT between airport and city stations, and the overall risk of dying was greater when airport MAT (+47% increase, 95%CI 38-57) was considered in comparison to city MAT (+37% increase, 95%CI 30-45). In Rome and Turin, the results were very similar for both apparent temperature measures.

 abstract = {This article provides (1) a synthesis of the literature on the linkages between air pollution and human health, (2) an overview of quality management approaches in Canada, the United States, and the European Union (EU), and (3) future directions for air quality research. Numerous studies examining short-term effects of air pollution show significant associations between ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) and other air pollutants and increases in premature mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Several well-designed epidemiological studies confirmed the adverse long-term effects of PM on both mortality and morbidity. Epidemiological studies also document significant associations between ozone (O3), sulfur (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) and adverse health outcomes; however, the effects of gaseous pollutants are less well documented. Subpopulations that are more susceptible to air pollution include children, the elderly, those with cardiorespiratory disease, and socioeconomically deprived individuals. Canada-wide standards for ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were set in 2000, providing air quality targets to be achieved by 2010. In the United States, the Clean Air Act provides the framework for the establishment and review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for criteria air pollutants and the establishment of emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants. The 1996 European Union's enactment of the Framework Directive for Air Quality established the process for setting Europe-wide limit values for a series of pollutants. The Clean Air for Europe program was established by the European Union to review existing limit values, emission ceilings, and abatement protocols, as set out in the current legislation. These initiatives serve as the legislative framework for air quality management in North America and Europe.},

 abstract = {An important and controversial health concern is whether low-dose exposures to hormonally active environmental oestrogens such as bisphenol A can promote human diseases including prostate cancer. Our studies in rats have shown that pharmacological doses of oestradiol administered during the critical window of prostate development result in marked prostate pathology in adulthood that progress to neoplastic lesions with ageing. Our recent studies have also demonstrated that transient developmental exposure of rats to low, environmentally relevant doses of bisphenol A or oestradiol increases prostate gland susceptibility to adult-onset precancerous lesions and hormonal carcinogenesis. These findings indicate that a wide range of oestrogenic exposures during development can predispose to prostatic neoplasia that suggests a potential developmental basis for this adult disease. To identify a molecular basis for oestrogen imprinting, we screened for DNA methylation changes over time in the exposed prostate glands. We found permanent alterations in DNA methylation patterns of multiple cell signalling genes suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of action. For phosphodiesterase type 4 variant 4 (PDE4D4), an enzyme responsible for intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate breakdown, a specific methylation cluster was identified in the 5'-flanking CpG island that was gradually hypermethylated with ageing in normal prostates resulting in loss of gene expression. However, in prostates exposed to neonatal oestradiol or bisphenol A, this region became hypomethylated with ageing resulting in persistent and elevated PDE4D4 expression. In total, these findings indicate that low-dose exposures to ubiquitous environmental oestrogens impact the prostate epigenome during development and in so doing, promote prostate disease with ageing.},

 abstract = {Inhaled airborne pollutants such as particulate matter increase the susceptibility to adverse health consequences and cardiovascular events. Diesel exhaust contributes significantly to the ambient particle pollution burden. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if exposure to a common component of diesel exhaust, phenanthraquinone (PQ), impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery and to determine whether age, gender, and/or hormonal status alter the putative effects of PQ on vasodilation. Vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) was assessed in vitro in intact control (age 6, 14, and 24 mo) and ovariectomized (age 6, 14, and 24 mo) female rats and intact (age 6 and 24 mo) male rats. Gender did not influence vasodilator capacity of the femoral principal nutrient artery, and there was an age-related decline in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in both female and male 24-mo-old rats. Exposure to PQ elicited a gender-specific affect in 6-mo-old rats; i.e., vasodilation was impaired 63% in male rats but had no effect in female rats. Exposure to PQ abolished vasodilation in 14- and 24-mo-old rats of both genders, and ovariectomy compromised vasodilator responsiveness to ACh in all age groups. The data demonstrate a vasoprotective mechanism in young female rats that may be related to endogenous ovarian hormones and provides evidence that suggests certain subsets of the population (e.g., elderly, males, and postmenopausal women) may be more susceptible to the adverse consequences of airborne pollutants.},

@article{pmid18314636,
 abstract = {As life expectancy in the West increases and companies can no longer promise lifelong security, many businesspeople will need to make major changes during middle age, embarking on a second life and a second career. They must start by getting beyond two pervasive and opposing myths. The first is that midlife marks the onset of decline. Problems do arise during middle age--concerns about health and finances, for instance--but one's life force does not expire at 65, nor do possibilities vanish. In fact, by middle age, most executives have gained a freedom that only self-knowledge can impart, and they relish unprecedented opportunities for personal growth. Midlife transitions, however, must be rooted in realism, not driven by the second myth, which paints middle age as a time of magical transformation. Contrary to what self-help books and inspirational speakers proclaim, such transformations do not happen. A 50-year-old with little musical training, for instance, will not suddenly become a concert pianist. People who buy into this myth find that their inevitable disappointment can be debilitating. Paradoxically, the doctrine that aims to encourage change actually stifles it. To make successful transitions, executives must stay open to the possibilities their experience qualifies them for but remain realistic about what they can achieve. For companies, employees' midlife transitions represent both a challenge (senior managers seemingly on track to become CEO may instead leave) and an opportunity (other midlife executives, with different perspectives and experiences, may knock on the door). Organizations must help middle-aged executives through this difficult period, not just by offering a workshop or two but by providing ongoing coaching and opportunities for personal and professional development.},

To describe the incidence of falls/injuries in a walking team ball game (Lifeball) designed for seniors, a prospective cohort study was undertaken amongst community dwelling Lifeball participants in Australia. Players completed a telephone survey soon after commencing Lifeball (2004) and 12 months later (2005). Attendance and incident records were audited for the period. Subjects joined a Lifeball group with opportunity to play at least once per week. Baseline was completed by 284 players aged between 40 and 96 years (mean 67 years), with most (83.8%, 238/284) female. Of 263 followed up, the average attendances was 25, with 19.3% attending on fewer than 4 occasions and 14.3% attending 52 or more times. Most (93.9%) reported no injuries requiring medical attention. However, 16 (6.1%) had injuries requiring medical attention and their 27 injuries represent an injury rate of 3.3 per 1000hours of participation. Twenty participants (7.6%) had a Lifeball fall equating to a fall rate of 2.8 per 1000hours of participation. Falls in Lifeball were not associated with measured predictors (age, gender, falls history, perceived falls risk or hours played). Incident records showed a trip/stumble involving rushing, walking backwards, or overextending (all against rules) as common falling causes. Lifeball is not 'risk free' however due to a lack of comparative data it is difficult to compare injury rate to relevant activities. Prevention of injury should concentrate on enforcing safety rules.},

By means of some typical case histories the practical problems arising in preclinical emergency medical intervention and the central role of context factors like social isolation, reduced mental capabilities and the resulting need for help are demonstrated. It is discussed how emergency medical services (EMS) can contribute to the problems of an ageing society beyond the scope of a system which is dedicated only to the individual. One possibility is the epidemiological analysis of geriatric emergencies, the accompanying context factors and the development of an adequate infrastructure which is adapted to the needs of the elderly. The EU project EMERGE is an example of how emergency medical expertise is utilized in an interdisciplinary cooperation. An automatically working system based on ambient sensor technology is developed for early detection and prevention of emergency situations in the home environment. Supportive technology ("assisted living") should enable the elderly to live a safe and self-determined life as long as possible. Integration of this additional information into the processes of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is the logistic prerequisite to establish a social medical assistance tailored to the needs of an ageing society.},

 abstract = {Over the past 30 years, there has been aplentitude of research into the health benefits of humor and laughter for healthy, sick, or depressed adults and children as well as for senior citizens. Medical research supports our human instinct that people who smile and laugh are happy, whereas those who are inexpressive are usually not happy. Research shows that humor stimulus results in mirth, which elicits a primarily emotional response with psychological efects, and laughter, which elicits a physical response with physiological effects. The many physiological benefits of laughter in older adults have been clearly demonstrated. Yet much of the medical research is based on experiments using funny videos and cartoons for humor sessions. I argue that "clowning around" with elderly people brings greater benefits than laughter alone. These benefits are clearly evident, though they may not be scientifically measurable: When the game is rooted in the patient's own imagination, thereby giving agency to a powerless individual it is many times more personal and transformative. In this article, I focus on my experiences with older adults while working with Clowns Without Borders and Risaterapia as well as on my own relationship with my grandfather.

In replying to these concerns, we describe the methods used to carry out time-series studies and discuss whether it is reasonable to believe that stress can confound the association. Our analysis suggests that these factors are unlikely to cause bias in time-series studies, although it may be important in panel and other longitudinal studies. Specifically, we argue that: (1) persons most likely to be susceptible to the effects of air pollution, notably the very young and the elderly, and those suffering from certain chronic diseases (e.g., congestive heart failure), are unlikely to be highly exposed to traffic and therefore to traffic-related stress and (2) over lengthy periods of time and sub-populations, levels of individual stress are unlikely to act coherently to create an association with ambient air pollution.},

In addition, in-training health professionals' exposure to home visits is limited for logistical reasons. A new method for medical students to learn how to perform an effective home visit was developed using an instructional video game. It was expected that students would learn the principles of a home visit using a video game while identifying the usefulness of video gaming (edutainment) in geriatrics education. A video game was created simulating a patient's house that the students were able to explore. Students played against time and distracters while being expected to click on those elements that they considered to be risk factors for falls or harmful for the patient. At the end of the game, the students received feedback on the chosen elements that were right or wrong. Finally, evaluation of the tool was obtained using pre- and posttests and pre- and postexposure feedback surveys. Fifty-six fourth-year medical students used the video game and completed the tests and the feedback surveys. This method showed a high level of engagement that is associated with improvement in knowledge. Additionally, users' feedback indicated that it was an innovative approach to the teaching of health sciences. In summary, this method provides medical students with a fun and structured experience that has an effect not only on their learning, but also on their understanding of the particular needs of the elderly population.},

 abstract = {The association between ambient temperature and mortality has been established worldwide, including the authors' prior study in California. Here, they examined cause-specific mortality, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and educational level to identify subgroups vulnerable to high ambient temperature. They obtained data on nine California counties from May through September of 1999-2003 from the National Climatic Data Center (countywide weather) and the California Department of Health Services (individual mortality). Using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, they obtained county-specific estimates of mortality, which were combined in meta-analyses. A total of 231,676 nonaccidental deaths were included. Each 10 degrees F (approximately 4.7 degrees C) increase in mean daily apparent temperature corresponded to a 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.9) increase for cardiovascular mortality, with the most significant risk found for ischemic heart disease. Elevated risks were also found for persons at least 65 years of age (2.2%, 95% CI: 0.04, 4.0), infants 1 year of age or less (4.9%, 95% CI: -1.8, 11.6), and the Black racial/ethnic group (4.9%, 95% CI: 2.0, 7.9). No differences were found by gender or educational level. To prevent the mortality associated with ambient temperature, persons with cardiovascular disease, the elderly, infants, and Blacks among others should be targeted.},

 abstract = {Over the past decade, miniaturization and cost reduction in semiconductors have led to computers smaller in size than a pinhead with powerful processing abilities that are affordable enough to be disposable. Similar advances in wireless communication, sensor design and energy storage have meant that the concept of a truly pervasive 'wireless sensor network', used to monitor environments and objects within them, has become a reality. The need for a wireless sensor network designed specifically for human body monitoring has led to the development of wireless 'body sensor network' (BSN) platforms composed of tiny integrated microsensors with on-board processing and wireless data transfer capability. The ubiquitous computing abilities of BSNs offer the prospect of continuous monitoring of human health in any environment, be it home, hospital, outdoors or the workplace. This pervasive technology comes at a time when Western world health care costs have sharply risen, reflected by increasing expenditure on health care as a proportion of gross domestic product over the last 20 years. Drivers of this rise include an ageing post 'baby boom' population, higher incidence of chronic disease and the need for earlier diagnosis. This paper outlines the role of pervasive health care technologies in providing more efficient health care.},

 abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that American society devalues its elderly. Young people incorporate pervasive attitudes at an early age. These attitudes are later reflected in the views of health professionals. An essential component of effective care for the elderly is the attitude of the caregivers. Staff attitudes are considered important because of their presumed influence on staff behavior and the quality of care delivered. Attitude change is very difficult to achieve unless the individual is exposed to an experience that places the learning situation on a very personal level. Experiential learning activities can be tailored to provide that personal experience. If attitudes can be changed at the same time that factual information is being presented, experiential activities offer the educator a potent tool for learning. This paper suggests several such activities aimed at enhancing positive attitudes toward the elderly.},

 abstract = {Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms with nearly 100 different species found in soil and water. The fatty-acid and wax-rich impermeable cell wall of the mycobacteria allow for adherence to solid substrates such as pipes and leaves, allowing the organism to persist despite treatment with common disinfectants. Mycobacteria can cause infection in both humans and animals. It is difficult to assess the incidence or prevalence of NTM disease due to multiple factors. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection may be difficult to differentiate from colonization, and when NTM infection is diagnosed, it is not a reportable disease. Furthermore, some species such as Mycobacterium gordonae may be a contaminant. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection is not a communicable disease, although health care-associated outbreaks have been reported, associated with a single facility or procedure. While the nontuberculous infection may affect other organs, the most common site is the lung, and the most common species is Mycobacterium avium complex, commonly referred to as MAC infection. An increasing occurrence of MAC has been reported, especially in certain populations such as middle-aged or elderly thin women, patients with chronic lung disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and cystic fibrosis. An association of NTM infection with gastroesophageal reflux disease has also been noted. The clinical presentation often includes chronic productive cough. Other less common symptoms include dyspnea and hemoptysis. With increased use of computed tomography and high-resolution computed tomography, patterns of MAC pulmonary infection have been described. Recently, the American Thoracic Society has outlined guidelines for the diagnosis and management of NTM infection. Treatment of NTM infection requires at least 3 effective drugs for a minimum of 12 months after sputum conversion to negative cultures. Surgical therapy may be considered for localized disease which has failed medical management. In this article, the clinical presentation, radiographic features, diagnostic evaluation, and management are discussed.},

Our recent work in detection of tripping gait patterns has demonstrated that minimum toe clearance (MTC) is a sensitive falls risk predictor. MTC measurement has previously been done in gait laboratories and on treadmills which potentially imposes controlled walking conditions. In this paper, we describe a prototype design of a wireless device for monitoring vertical toe clearance. The sensors consists of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope connected to Crossbow sensor motes for wireless data transmission. Sensor data are transmitted to a laptop and displayed on a Matlab graphic user interface (GUI). We have performed zero base and treadmill experiments to investigate sensor performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20m indoors and 50m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements were found to follow the Optotrak measurement trend but could be improved further by dealing with double integration errors and improving data transmission rates.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews some evidence of the toxic effects of lead (Pb) in the context of vulnerable subpopulations and emergency preparedness. Pb is ubiquitous in the environment and is used in many building materials. Environmental Pb concentrations and body burdens of Pb have been shown to increase following disasters. Pb is a systemic toxicant with no known beneficial biological function and, for several endpoints, no identified threshold of toxicity. The fetus, children, pregnant and elderly are particularly susceptible to some of the toxic effects of Pb. Pb exposures in infancy have been shown in vivo to produce an equal degree of neurobehavioural impairment as exposures of much longer duration at equivalent doses during adolescence. Evidence from animal bioassays indicates that the carcinogenic potency of perinatal Pb exposure may be about 3-fold higher than adult lifetime exposure at an equivalent dose. Animal assays show up to a 12-fold difference between fetal, neonatal and adult life stages in sensitivity to the immunological effects of Pb. Pb exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality--health endpoints for which the elderly are at increased risk. Finally, endogenous and exogenous variables, such as psychological and physiological stress, dietary deficiencies and concomitant exposure to other chemical, biological and radiological hazards, can also potentially modify or potentiate the toxic effects of Pb. Because of the potential for concurrent influence of these modifying variables in a post-disaster environment, emergency response planners are encouraged to consider disaster victims and responders, as a whole, as a potentially vulnerable subpopulation.},

@article{pmid19453204,
 abstract = {In older adults, as in younger individuals, habitual moderate-intensity physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of various chronic health conditions, including certain types of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease and certain forms of cancer. However, the pattern of physical activity associated with such benefits remains unclear. One problem is that most investigators have examined patterns of physical activity using either subjective questionnaires or accelerometer or pedometer measurements limited to a single week, despite clear evidence of both the unreliability/invalidity of questionnaires and seasonal changes in activity patterns. Since 2000, we have thus conducted an interdisciplinary study examining the habitual physical activity and health of elderly people living in a medium-sized Japanese town (the Nakanojo Study). In about one-tenth of some 5000 available subjects aged > or =65 years, physical activity has already been assessed continuously for 24 h/day for >8 years using a specially adapted pedometer/accelerometer. This device has a storage capacity of 36 days and can distinguish >10 intensities of physical activity (expressed in metabolic equivalents [METs]). Data have to date been summarized as daily step counts and daily durations of activity of <3 and >3 METs, averaged over a 1-year period. This article provides a detailed overview of both factors influencing habitual physical activity and relationships between such activity and health in an elderly population. To date, analyses have been cross-sectional in type. Substantial associations have been noted between the overall health of participants and both the daily duration of effort undertaken at an intensity of >3 METs and the daily step count. In men, the extent of health is associated more closely with the daily duration of activity of >3 METs than with the daily step count, whereas in women, the association is closer for the step count than for the duration of activity >3 METs. In both sexes, the threshold amount of physical activity associated with better health is greater for physical than for mental benefits: >8000 versus >4000 steps/day and/or >20 versus >5 min/day at an intensity >3 METs, respectively. In other words, better physical health is seen in those spending at least 20 min/day in moderate walking (at a pace of around 1.4 m/s [5 km/h]) and a further >60 min of light activity per day. In contrast, better mental health is associated with much smaller amounts of deliberate physical activity. The daily step count and the daily durations of activity of <3 and >3 METs are all influenced by meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature. Activity decreases exponentially to about 4000 steps/day as precipitation increases. Excluding the influence of rainfall, the daily step count peaks at a mean outdoor temperature of around 17 degrees C; above and especially below such readings, physical activity decreases as a quadratic function of temperature. Seasonal changes in microclimate should thus be considered when designing interventions intended to increase the habitual physical activity of elderly people. The observed associations between physical activity and health outcomes point to a need for longitudinal analyses; these should examine potential causal interpretations of the current findings and elucidate possible additional mediating variables.},

 abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have established an association between exposures to air pollution particles and human mortality and morbidity at concentrations of particles currently found in major metropolitan areas. The adverse effects of pollution particles are most prominent in susceptible subjects, including the elderly and patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. Controlled human exposure studies have been used to confirm the causal relationship between pollution particle exposure and adverse health effects. Earlier studies enrolled mostly young healthy subjects and have largely confirmed the capability of particles to cause adverse health effects shown in epidemiological studies. In the last few years, more studies involving susceptible populations have been published. These recent studies in susceptible populations, however, have shown that the adverse responses to particles appear diminished in these susceptible subjects compared to those in healthy subjects. The present paper reviewed and compared control human exposure studies to particles and sought to explain the "unexpected" response to particle exposure in these susceptible populations and make recommendations for future studies. We found that the causes for the discrepant results are likely multifactorial. Factors such as medications, the disease itself, genetic susceptibility, subject selection bias that is intrinsic to many controlled exposure studies and nonspecificity of study endpoints may explain part of the results. Future controlled exposure studies should select endpoints that are more closely related to the pathogenesis of the disease and reflect the severity of particle-induced health effects in the specific populations under investigation. Future studies should also attempt to control for medications and genetic susceptibility. Using a different study design, such as exposing subjects to filtered air and ambient levels of particles, and assessing the improvement in biological endpoints during filtered air exposure, may allow the inclusion of higher risk patients who are likely the main contributors to the increased particle-induced health effects in epidemiological studies.},

The aim of this work is to highlight the interactions that may take place among siblings when deciding whether or not to become a caregiver. We look at families with two children using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; our sample contains 314 dependent elderly and their 628 adult children. In order to identify the interactions between siblings, we have specified a two-person discrete game model. To estimate this model, without invoking the 'coherency' condition, we have added an endogenous selection rule to solve the incompleteness problem arising from multiplicity or absence of equilibrium. Our empirical results suggest that the three classical effects identified by Manski could potentially explain the observed correlation between the siblings' caregiving behaviour. Correlated effects alone appear to be weak. Contextual interactions and endogenous interactions reveal cross-effects. The asymmetric character of the endogenous interactions is our most striking result. The younger child's involvement appears to increase the net benefit of caregiving for the elder one, whereas the elder child's involvement decreases the net benefit of caregiving for the younger child.},

The following data, mostly from Norway, will be reviewed: Variation of ambient solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) and vitamin D status with season and latitude, variation of incidence rates and prognosis of skin cancer and variation of prognosis of internal cancer with latitude and season. In short, the following issues are discussed: 1) Vitamin D level varies with season, but probably not with latitude in Norway, because of an increased intake of vitamin D in the north; 2) Skin cancer incidence rates increase from north to south, as do annual fluence rates of UV radiation, while there seems to be a slight improvement in prognosis from north to south; 3) Prognosis of internal cancer is best for cases diagnosed in the seasons with the best vitamin D status, i.e. in summer and autumn; 4) Incidence rates of cutaneous melanomas have increased from 1960 to 1990, but have decreased slightly thereafter for young people; 5) Changes in sun exposure habits have taken place; 6) An increase in body mass index (BMI) of the population has occurred, which may have led to a worsening of the vitamin D status.},

@article{pmid19852560,
 abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a ubiquitous atmospheric pollutant due to the widespread prevalence of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and it can be a respiratory irritant when inhaled at elevated concentrations. Evidence for health effects of ambient NO2 derives from three types of studies: observational epidemiology, human clinical exposures, and animal toxicology. Our review focuses on the human clinical studies of adverse health effects of short-term NO2 exposures, given the substantial uncertainties and limitations in interpretation of the other lines of evidence. We examined more than 50 experimental studies of humans inhaling NO2, finding notably that the reporting of statistically significant changes in lung function and bronchial sensitivity did not show a consistent trend with increasing NO2 concentrations. Functional changes were generally mild and transient, the reported effects were not uniformly adverse, and they were not usually accompanied by NO2-dependent increases in symptoms. The available human clinical results do not establish a mechanistic pathway leading to adverse health impacts for short-term NO2 exposures at levels typical of maximum 1-h concentrations in the present-day ambient environment (i.e., below 0.2 ppm). Our review of these data indicates that a health-protective, short-term NO2 guideline level for susceptible (and healthy) populations would reflect a policy choice between 0.2 and 0.6 ppm. EXTENDED ABSTRACT: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a ubiquitous atmospheric pollutant due to the widespread prevalence of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and it can be a respiratory irritant when inhaled at elevated concentrations. Natural NO2 sources include volcanic action, forest fires, lightning, and the stratosphere; man-made NO2 emissions derive from fossil fuel combustion and incineration. The current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for NO2, initially established in 1971, is 0.053 ppm (annual average). Ambient concentrations monitored in urban areas in the United States are approximately 0.015 ppm, as an annual mean, i.e., below the current NAAQS. Short-term (1-h peak) NO2 concentrations outdoors are not likely to exceed 0.2 ppm, and even 1-h periods exceeding 0.1 ppm are infrequent. Inside homes, 1-h NO2 peaks, typically arising from gas cooking, can range between 0.4 and 1.5 ppm. The health effects evidence of relevance to ambient NO2 derives from three lines of investigation: epidemiology studies, human clinical studies, and animal toxicology studies. The NO2 epidemiology remains inconsistent and uncertain due to the potential for exposure misclassification, residual confounding, and co-pollutant effects, whereas animal toxicology findings using high levels of NO2 exposure require extrapolation to humans exposed at low ambient NO2 levels. Given the limitations and uncertainties in the other lines of health effects evidence, our review thus focused on clinical studies where human volunteers (including asthmatics, children, and elderly) inhaled NO2 at levels from 0.1 to 3.5 ppm during short-term ((1/2)-6-h) exposures, often combined with exercise, and occasionally combined with co-pollutants. We examined the reported biological effects and classified them into (a) lung immune responses and inflammation, (b) lung function changes and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and (c) health effects outside the lungs (extrapulmonary). We examined more than 50 experimental studies of humans inhaling NO2, finding that such clinical data on short-term exposure allowed discrimination of NO2 no-effect levels versus lowest-adverse-effects levels. Our conclusions are summarized by these six points: For lung immune responses and inflammation: (1) healthy subjects exposed to NO2 below 1 ppm do not show pulmonary inflammation; (2) at 2 ppm for 4 h, neutrophils and cytokines in lung-lavage fluid can increase, but these changes do not necessarily correlate with significant or sustained changes in lung function; (3) there is no consistent evidence that NO2 concentrations below 2 ppm increase susceptibility to viral infection; (4) for asthmatics and individuals having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), NO2-induced lung inflammation is not expected below 0.6 ppm, although one research group reported enhancement of proinflammatory processes at 0.26 ppm. With regard to NO2-induced AHR: (5) studies of responses to specific or nonspecific airway challenges (e.g., ragweed, methacholine) suggest that asthmatic individuals were not affected by NO2 up to about 0.6 ppm, although some sensitive subsets may respond to levels as low as 0.2 ppm. And finally, for extra-pulmonary effects: (6) such effects (e.g., changes in blood chemistry) generally required NO2 concentrations above 1-2 ppm. Overall, our review of data from experiments with humans indicates that a health-protective, short-term-average NO2 guideline level for susceptible populations (and healthy populations) would reflect a policy choice between 0.2 and 0.6 ppm. The available human clinical results do not establish a mechanistic pathway leading to adverse health impacts for short-term NO2 exposures at levels typical of maximum 1-h concentrations in the present-day ambient environment (i.e., below 0.2 ppm).},

The objective of the study presented here was to determine the relationship between air pollution from particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10; mostly PM2.5, or particulate matter <2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) and health effects measured as the daily number of deaths, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits for cardiovascular, respiratory, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) diseases. The Air Pollution Health Effects European Approach (APHEA2) protocol was followed, and a multivariate Poisson regression model was fitted, controlling for trend, seasonality, and confounders for Temuco during 1998-2006. The results show that PM10 had a significant association with daily mortality and morbidity, with the elderly (population >65 yr of age) being the group that presented the greatest risk. The relative risk for respiratory causes, with an increase of 100 microg/m3 of PM10, was 1.163 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.057-1.279 for mortality, 1.137 (CI 1.096-1.178) for hospital admissions, and 1.162 for ARI (CI 1.144-1.181). There is evidence in Temuco of positive relationships between ambient particulate levels and mortality, hospital admissions, and ARI for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These results are consistent with those of comparable studies in other similar cities where wood smoke is the most important air pollution problem.},

 abstract = {Predicting chronic exposure to air pollution at the intra-urban scale has been recognized as a priority area of research for environmental epidemiology. Exposure assessment models attempt to predict and proxy for individuals' personal exposure to ambient air pollution, and there are no studies to date that explicitly attempt to compare and cross-validate personal exposure concentrations with pollutants modeled at the intra-urban level using methods such as interpolated surfaces and land-use regression (LUR) models. This study aimed to identify how well personal exposure to NO(2) (nitrogen dioxide) can be predicted from ambient exposure measurements and intra-urban exposure estimates using LUR and what other factors contribute to predicting variations in personal exposure beyond measured pollutant levels within home. Personal, indoor and outdoor NO(2) were measured in a population of older adults (>65 yr old) living in Hamilton, Canada. Our results show that personal NO(2) was most strongly associated with contemporaneously collected indoor and outdoor concentrations of NO(2). Predicted NO(2) exposures from intra-urban LUR models were not associated with personal NO(2), whereas interpolated surfaces of particulates and ozone were modestly associated. Combinations of variables that best predicted personal NO(2) variability were derived from time-activity diaries, interpolated surfaces of ambient particulate pollutants, and a city wide temporally matched average of NO(2). The nonsignificant associations between personal NO(2) and the modeled ambient NO(2) concentrations suggest that observed associations between NO(2) generated by LUR models and health effects are probably not produced by NO(2), but by other pollutants that follow a similar spatial pattern.},

 abstract = {Due to the socio-demographic change in most developed western countries, elderly populations have been continuously increasing. Therefore, preventive and assistive systems that allow elderly people to independently live in their own homes as long as possible will become an economical if not ethical necessity. These respective technologies are being developed under the term "Ambient Assistive Technologies" (AAT). The EU-funded AAT-project Ambient Lighting Assistance for an Ageing Population (ALADIN) has established the long-term goal to create an adaptive system capable of improving the residential lighting conditions of single living elderly persons also aiming at supporting the preservation of their independence.Results of an earlier survey revealed that the elderly perceived their current lighting situation as satisfactory, whereas interviewers assessed in-house lighting as too dark and risk-laden. The overall results of ALADIN showed a significant increase in well-being from the baseline final testing with the new adaptive lighting system.Positive results for wellbeing and life quality suggest that the outcome effects may be attributed to the introduction of technology as well as to social contacts arising from participating in the study. The technological guidance of the study supervisors, in particular, may have produced a strong social reactivity effect that was first observed in the famous Hawthorne experiments in the 1930s. As older adults seem to benefit both from meaningful social contacts as well as assistive technologies, the question arises how assistive technology can be socially embedded to be able to maximize positive health effects. Therefore ethical guidelines for development and use of new assistive technologies for handicapped/older persons have to be developed and should be discussed with regard to their applicability in the context of AAT.},

 abstract = {This article provides a detailed overview of both factors influencing habitual physical activity, and relationships between such activity and health in the elderly. Current cross-sectional data from the Nakanojo Study, which we have been carrying out since 2000, indicate substantial associations between the overall health of participants, and both the year-averaged daily step count and the year-averaged daily duration of effort undertaken at an intensity >3 metabolic equivalents (MET). In men, the extent of health is associated more closely with the daily duration of activity >3 MET than with the daily step count, whereas in women the association is closer for the step count than for the duration of activity >3 MET. In both sexes, the threshold amount of physical activity associated with better health is greater for physical than for mental benefits: >8000 vs >4000 steps/day and/or >20 vs >5 min/day at >3 MET, respectively. In other words, physical health is better in those spending at least 20 min/day in moderate walking (at a pace of around 1.4 m/s [5 km/h]) and a further >60 min of light activity per day. In contrast, better mental health is associated with much smaller amounts of deliberate physical activity. Both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature. Activity decreases exponentially to about 4000 steps/day as precipitation increases. Excluding the influence of rainfall, the daily step count peaks at a mean outdoor temperature of around 17 degrees C; above and especially below such readings, physical activity decreases as a quadratic function of temperature. Seasonal changes in the microclimate should thus be considered when designing interventions intended to increase the habitual physical activity of older adults. Based on these findings, we are now developing preventive tactics that should contribute to health promotion, disease prevention and thus a reduction in medical expenses for elderly people.},

 abstract = {The short-term effects of high temperatures are a serious concern in the context of climate change. In areas that today have mild climates the research activity has been rather limited, despite the fact that differences in temperature susceptibility will play a fundamental role in understanding the exposure, acclimatization, adaptation and health risks of a changing climate. In addition, many studies employ biometeorological indexes without careful investigation of the regional heterogeneity in the impact of relative humidity. We aimed to investigate the effects of summer temperature and relative humidity and regional differences in three regions of Sweden allowing for heterogeneity of the effect over the scale of summer temperature. To do so, we collected mortality data for ages 65+ from Stockholm, Göteborg and Skåne from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for the years 1998 through 2005. In Stockholm and Skåne on average 22 deaths per day occurred, while in Göteborg the mean frequency of daily deaths was 10. We fitted time-series regression models to estimate relative risks of high ambient temperatures on daily mortality using smooth functions to control for confounders, and estimated non-linear effects of exposure while allowing for auto-regressive correlation of observations within summers. The effect of temperature on mortality was found distributed over the same or following day, with statistically significant cumulative combined relative risk of about 5.1% (CI = 0.3, 10.1) per degrees C above the 90th percentile of summer temperature. The effect of high relative humidity was statistically significant in only one of the regions, as was the effect of relative humidity (above 80th percentile) and temperature (above 90th percentile). In the southernmost region studied there appeared to be a significant increase in mortality with decreasing low summer temperatures that was not apparent in the two more northerly situated regions. The effects of warm temperatures on the elderly population in Sweden are rather strong and consistent across different regions after adjustment for mortality displacement. The impact of relative humidity appears to be different in regions, and may be a more important predictor of mortality in some areas.},

The diagnosis of COPD is primarily based on the physiological documentation of airflow limitation using spirometry. However, several controversies exist as to the range of predicted normal values for these measurements in the elderly population, and the clinical presentation of COPD in the elderly may be complicated by the presence of several comorbidities. Many non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available for managing COPD. However, management of COPD in the elderly population may be challenged by the "polypharmacy" of medications that these patients often take, which can interfere with compliance with therapy. Additionally, the elderly often suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities that can prevent compliance with prescribed medications. Lastly, adverse effects from medications prescribed for treatment of COPD may be more pervasive in elderly patients.},

Results showed that 73% of participants reported having a home air conditioner. The average number of hours spent per 24-hour period in air-conditioned spaces during heat waves was 14.5 hours (SD = 9.4). Exploratory structural equation modeling showed that specific beliefs about the benefits of and drawbacks to AC as well as internal cues to action were predictive of its level of use, whereas the perceived severity of the effects of heat on health was not. The findings are discussed in light of the need to adequately support effective response to extreme heat in this vulnerable population.},

This ecological study examined data from participants of the 2004 Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study postal survey and compared the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in Launceston (n=601) with that in Hobart (n=1071), a larger Tasmanian city with much less wood smoke. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations of interest while adjusting for gender, atopy, history of allergic disease and current smoking status. There were no significant differences in symptom prevalence between Launceston and Hobart. Two subgroup analyses, which examined participants with pre-existing chronic respiratory disease, and those who reported actively using a wood burner in their home, also did not find significant differences. Any impact of wood smoke on non-specific respiratory symptoms might have been overshadowed by other important determinants of respiratory health, such as vehicle exhaust and tobacco smoking, or were too small to have been detected. However, the lack of detectable differences in symptom prevalence might also reflect the success of regulatory action by local governments to reduce wood smoke emissions in Launceston. The results of other epidemiological studies support an association between ambient wood smoke exposure and adverse respiratory health. Further investigations of wood smoke exposure in Australian settings are needed to investigate the lack of significant associations found in this study, especially studies of indoor air quality and health impacts in children and elderly populations.},

The 17 European project partners are strictly working together since February 2008 to realize and open platform to manage and monitor elderly patients with chronic diseases and many difficulties to reach hospital centers for routine controls. The testing activities will be done in Italy and Spain involving COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) patients, these being widespread and highly expensive in terms of social and economic costs. Patients, equipped by wearable technologies and sensors and interacting with lifestyle interfaces, will be assisted by healthcare personnel able to check the health record and critical conditions through the Chronious platform data analysis and decision support system. Additionally, the new ontology based literature search engine will help the clinicians in the standardization of care delivery process.

Falls are the most common causes of serious injuries and a major health threats in the stratum of older population. Early detection of a fall is a key factor when trying to provide adequate care to the elderly person who has suffered an accident at home. In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by a static wireless nonintrusive sensorial infrastructure based on heterogenous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure, named AID (Alarm Intelligent Device), is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. We have developed, different to other contributions, a specific low-power multi-hop network consists of nodes (Motes) that wirelessly communicate to each other and are capable of hopping radio messages to a base station where they are passed to a PC (or other possible client). The goal of this project is 1) to provide alerts to caregivers in the event of an accident, acute illness or strange (possibly dangerous) activities, and 2) to enable that authorized and authenticated caregivers by means of a itinerant wearable mote can be inserted into mesh and interact with it. In this paper, we describe an ubiquitous assistential monitoring system at home.},

Aiming at assistance seamlessly integrated into a person's household, we carried out an initial user study to investigate the technology and the kind of desired assistance of such a personal household assistant system should offer. We designed a reminder system for appointments and activities that uses different sounds, light colours or vibration patterns to represent different categories of calendar events such as upcoming tasks and appointments. The evaluation results show a preference for solely acoustic presentations or an acoustic presentation in combination with visual and tactile output.

However, this goal can only be achieved through a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms by which neurons die in these degenerative disorders. We review here the question of nitric oxide (NO), a small and ubiquitous molecule believed to be a pivotal element in the cascade of deleterious events underlying neurodegeneration in PD. Since NO synthases (NOS) are the only known enzymes that produce NO, in this chapter particular attention is paid to the anatomic distribution and catalytic activity of these enzymes in the brain. We also provide several experimental protocols commonly used for quantitative and qualitative studies of NOS.},

 abstract = {Urban heat island effect refers to the phenomenon that ambient air and surface temperatures in urban areas are several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Higher temperatures not only impact the comfort of urban dwellers, but also increase energy use, ozone production, and the risk of death for humans in a heat wave. Our research focuses on the variation in land surface temperature in the Gywnns Fall Watershed, Maryland. We found that land surface temperature is highly variable spatially, resulting in "hotspots" within the heat island. We further explore how this temperature variation relates to social factors on the scale of the census-based block group. We show that land surface temperature is statistically higher in block groups that are characterized by low income, high poverty, less education, more ethnic minorities, more elderly people and greater risk of crime. These variables were mapped to evaluate the spatial relationship of land surface temperatures to social factors. This spatially explicit approach facilitates identification of specific areas to prioritize for heat prevention and intervention efforts. We demonstrate, through an exercise, how incorporating data on land surface temperature and social factors into heat intervention strategies could contribute to efficient allocation of limited resources and services. The exercise also indicates where heat prevention efforts, such as tree-planting programs, are most needed to help reduce heat exposure and moderate the urban heat island effect.},

 abstract = {In recent years several world-wide ambient assisted living (AAL) programs have been activated in order to improve the quality of life of older people, and to strengthen the industrial base through the use of information and communication technologies. An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily living (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.},

 abstract = {With health care expenditures skyrocketing, coupled with pervasive quality deficits, pressures to provide better and more proficient care continue to shape the landscape of the U.S. health care system. Payers, both federal and private, have laid out several initiatives designed to curtail costs, including value-based reimbursement programs, cost-shifting expenses to the consumer, reducing reimbursements for physicians, steering health care to more efficient settings, and finally affordable health care reform. Consequently, one of the major aspects in the expansion of health care for improving quality and reducing the costs is surgical services. Nearly 57 million outpatient procedures are performed annually in the United States, 14 million of which occur in elderly patients. Increasing use of these minor, yet common, procedures contributes to rising health care expenditures. Once exclusive within hospitals, more and more outpatient procedures are being performed in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), physician offices, visits to which have increased over 300% during the past decade. Concurrent with this growing demand, the number of ASCs has more than doubled since the 1990s, with more than 5,000 facilities currently in operation nationwide. Further, total surgical center ASC payments have increased from $1.2 billion in 1999 to $3.2 billion in 2009, a 167% increase. On the same lines, growth and expenditures for hospital outpatient department (HOPD) services and office procedures also have been evident at similar levels. Recent surveys have illustrated on overall annual growth per capita in Medicare allowed ASC services of pain management of 23%, with 27% growth seen in ASCs and 16% of the growth seen in HOPD. Further, the proportion of interventional pain management which was 4% of Medicare ASC spending in 2000 has increase to 10% in 2007. Thus, interventional pain management as an evolving specialty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in ASC settings apart from HOPDs and well-equipped offices. In June 1998, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), proposed an ASC rule in which at least 60% of interventional procedures were eliminated from ASCs and the remaining 40% faced substantial cuts in payments. Following the publication of this rule, based on public comments and demand, Congress intervened and delayed implementation of the rule for several years. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published its proposed outpatient prospective system for ASCs in 2006, setting ASC payments at 62% of HOPD payments. Following multiple changes, the rule was incorporated with a 4-year transition formula which ended in 2010, with full effect taking effect in 2011 with ASCs reimbursed at 57% of HOPD payments. Thus, the landscape of interventional pain management in ambulatory surgery centers has been constantly changing with declining reimbursements, issues of fraud and abuse, and ever-increasing regulations.},

 abstract = {Parasitism and other stressors are ubiquitous in nature but their effects on animal behaviour can be difficult to identify. We investigated the effects of nematode parasitism and other indicators of physiological impairment on the sequential complexity of foraging and locomotion behaviour among wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). We observed all sexually mature individuals (n = 28) in one macaque study group between October 2007 and August 2008, and collected two faecal samples/month/individual (n = 362) for parasitological examination. We used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to investigate long-range autocorrelation in separate, binary sequences of foraging (n = 459) and locomotion (n = 446) behaviour collected via focal sampling. All behavioural sequences exhibited long-range autocorrelation, and linear mixed-effects models suggest that increasing infection with the nodular worm Oesophagostomum aculeatum, clinically impaired health, reproductive activity, ageing and low dominance status were associated with reductions in the complexity of locomotion, and to a lesser extent foraging, behaviour. Furthermore, the sequential complexity of behaviour increased with environmental complexity. We argue that a reduction in complexity in animal behaviour characterizes individuals in impaired or 'stressed' states, and may have consequences if animals cannot cope with heterogeneity in their natural habitats.},

 abstract = {Although the relation between outdoor air pollution and daily mortality has been examined in several Chinese cities, there are still a number of key scientific issues to be addressed concerning the health effects of air pollution in China. Given the changes over the past decade in concentrations and sources of air pollution (e.g., the change from one predominant source [coal combustion], which was typical of the twentieth century, to a mix of sources [coal combustion and motor-vehicle emissions]) and transition in China, it is worthwhile to investigate the acute effects of outdoor air pollution on mortality outcomes in the country. We conducted a time-series study to investigate the relation between outdoor air pollution and daily mortality in Shanghai using four years of daily data (2001-2004). This study is a part of the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) program supported by the Health Effects Institute (HEI). We collected data on daily mortality, air pollution, and weather from the Shanghai Municipal Center of Disease Control and Prevention (SMCDCP), Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, and Shanghai Meteorologic Bureau. An independent auditing team assigned by HEI validated all the data. Our statistical analysis followed the Common Protocol of the PAPA program (found at the end of this volume). Briefly, a natural-spline model was used to analyze the mortality, air pollution, and covariate data. We first constructed the basic models for various mortality outcomes excluding variables for air pollution, and used the partial autocorrelation function of the residuals to guide the selection of degrees of freedom for time trend and lag days for the autoregression terms. Thereafter, we introduced the pollutant variables and analyzed their effects on mortality outcomes, including both mortality due to all natural (nonaccidental) causes and cause-specific mortality. We fitted single- and multipollutant models to assess the stability of the effects of the pollutants. For mortality due to all natural causes, we also examined the associations stratified by sex and age. Stratified analyses by education level, used as a measure of socioeconomic status, were conducted as well. In addition to an analysis of the entire study period, the effects of air pollution in just the warm season (from April to September) and cool season (from October to March) were analyzed. We also examined the effects of alternative model specifications--such as lag effects of pollutants and temperature, degrees of freedom for time trend and weather conditions, statistical approaches, and averaging methods for pollutant concentrations-on the estimated effects of air pollution. We found significant associations between the air pollutants--particulate matter 10 pm or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) -and daily mortality from all natural causes and from cardiopulmonary diseases. The increased mortality risks found in the data from Shanghai were generally similar in magnitude, per concentration of pollutant, to the risks found in research from other parts of the world. An increase of 10 microg/m3 in 2-day moving average concentrations of PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 corresponded to 0.26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.37), 0.95% (95% CI, 0.62-1.28), 0.97% (95% CI, 0.66-1.27), and 0.31% (95% CI, 0.04-0.58) increases, respectively, in mortality due to all natural causes. Sensitivity analyses suggested that our findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. We found significant effects of the gaseous pollutants SO2 and NO2 on daily mortality after adjustment for PM10. Our analysis also provided preliminary, but not conclusive, evidence that women, older people, and people with a low level of education might be more vulnerable to air pollution than men, younger people, and people with a high level of education. In addition, the associations between air pollution and daily mortality appeared to be more pronounced in the cool season than in the warm. We concluded that short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution (PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3) was associated with daily mortality in Shanghai and that gaseous pollutants might have independent health effects in the city. Overall, the results of the study appeared largely consistent with those reported in other locations worldwide. Further research will be needed to disentangle the effects of the various pollutants and to gain more conclusive insights into the influence of various sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and socioeconomic status) and of season on the associations between air pollution and daily mortality.},

This paper provides a brief state-of-the-art overview of health and healthcare smartphone apps (applications) on the market today, including emerging trends and market uptake. Platforms available today include Android, Apple iOS, RIM BlackBerry, Symbian, and Windows (Windows Mobile 6.x and the emerging Windows Phone 7 platform). The paper covers apps targeting both laypersons/patients and healthcare professionals in various scenarios, e.g., health, fitness and lifestyle education and management apps; ambient assisted living apps; continuing professional education tools; and apps for public health surveillance. Among the surveyed apps are those assisting in chronic disease management, whether as standalone apps or part of a BAN (Body Area Network) and remote server configuration. We describe in detail the development of a smartphone app within eCAALYX (Enhanced Complete Ambient Assisted Living Experiment, 2009-2012), an EU-funded project for older people with multiple chronic conditions. The eCAALYX Android smartphone app receives input from a BAN (a patient-wearable smart garment with wireless health sensors) and the GPS (Global Positioning System) location sensor in the smartphone, and communicates over the Internet with a remote server accessible by healthcare professionals who are in charge of the remote monitoring and management of the older patient with multiple chronic conditions. Finally, we briefly discuss barriers to adoption of health and healthcare smartphone apps (e.g., cost, network bandwidth and battery power efficiency, usability, privacy issues, etc.), as well as some workarounds to mitigate those barriers.},

 abstract = {Acute ambient ozone (O(3)) exposure is associated with the increased mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular diseases. The dysfunction of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), indicated by the disturbed heart rate variability (HRV), may be the most important underlying mechanism. Previous studies reported the heterogeneous associations between O(3) within several hours' exposure and HRV on general elderly subjects, in which poor surrogate of exposure evaluation and different health status of the subjects may be responsible for the heterogeneous associations. No studies were found focusing on the O(3)-mediated HRV effects within several minutes' exposure on healthy older subjects until recently. We measured the real-time 5-min ambient O(3) concentration and HRV frequency indices in 20 healthy elderly subjects in two surveys, with the 1st and 2nd survey in summer and winter, respectively. Mixed-linear model was used to evaluate the associations between the ambient 5-min average O(3) and concurrent 5-min HRV frequency indices measured during the outdoor period. After adjusting the co-pollutants (ambient PM(2.5) and nitrogen oxides concentrations) and subject characteristics, high frequency (HF) changed -4.87% (95% CI -8.62 to -0.97%) per 10 ppb increment of O(3), whereas decreased low frequency (LF) and increased LFHFR were found to be marginally associated with the elevated O(3) (P values were 0.092 and 0.069). We concluded that the ambient O(3) exert transient decrease effects on HRV, which may induce acute cardiac events.},

 abstract = {Through an integration of wireless communication and sensing technologies, the concept of a body sensor network (BSN) was initially proposed in the early decade with the aim to provide an essential technology for wearable, ambulatory, and pervasive health monitoring for elderly people and chronic patients. It has become a hot research area due to big opportunities as well as great challenges it presents. Though the idea of an implantable BSN was proposed in parallel with the on-body sensor network, the development in this area is relatively slow due to the complexity of human body, safety concerns, and some technological bottlenecks such as the design of ultralow-power implantable RF transceiver. This paper describes a new wireless implantable BSN that operates in medical implant communication service (MICS) frequency band. This system innovatively incorporates both sensing and actuation nodes to form a closed-control loop for physiological monitoring and drug delivery for critically ill patients. The sensing node, which is designed using system-on-chip technologies, takes advantage of the newly available ultralow-power Zarlink MICS transceiver for wireless data transmission. Finally, the specific absorption rate distribution of the proposed system was simulated to determine the in vivo electromagnetic field absorption and the power safety limits.},

Vitamin D deficiency is a poorly recognized pandemic with evidence to indicate inadequate testing and monitoring of response to treatment in high-risk populations. Vitamin D receptors are ubiquitous in the human body and while the endocrine effects of vitamin D are well recognized, the autocrine and paracrine effects of this steroid hormone are less well appreciated. These functions include antimicrobial and immunomodulation effects as well benefits on cardiovascular health, autoimmune disease, cancer and metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency increases mortality and even a modest amount of vitamin D may enhance longevity. Emerging evidence suggests that a vitamin D replete state carries significant health benefits in acute illness. In this review, we discuss the role of vitamin D deficiency and potential benefits in treating this deficiency focusing on the implications for managing acute illness in elderly patients and those with an underlying chronic illness.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological evidence related to increased death from hyperthermia suggests higher frailty in the elderly when exposed to high ambient temperatures. Despite the recent awareness of such public health problems, integrative studies investigating the effects of age on the physiological responses to heat wave thermal conditions remain scarce. Daily rhythmicity of core temperature (T(c)) and locomotor activity (LA), as well as parameters representative of energy balance and IGF-1 levels which are involved in the aging process and stress resistance, were monitored in a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Adult and aged animals, acclimated to long days (LD) or short days (SD), were monitored during 8-day periods of exposure to 25 ° C and 34 ° C. Adult animals displayed efficient coping with heat exposure, regardless of the photoperiod. Hence, efficient responses resulted in decrease of energy intake, energy expenditure, IGF-1 levels and LA levels, promoting hyperthermia avoidance. Positive energy balance was maintained and water turnover did not change significantly after heat exposure. In contrast, while aged animals acclimated to LD responded similarly to adults, aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD showed great difficulties coping with heat exposure. Indeed, in this group, normothermia impairment was associated with increased T(c) levels, alterations in daily rhythmicity, negative energy balance and increased IGF-1 levels. Impaired responses to heat exposure were seen in aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD only. The main effects were observed during diurnal resting periods, suggesting decreased capacities with age to dissipate excess body heat. Taken together, these data highlight daily rhythmicity and IGF-1 pathway as main targets in the impaired response to heat exposure in the elderly.},

Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to cause the increase in atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including the activation by particulate matter of inflammatory pathways and hemostasis factors, production of reactive oxygen species through the oxidative stress pathway, alterations in vascular tone, and decreased heart rate variability (a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and a predictor of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias). Current knowledge on the biologic mechanisms and the clinical effect of short- and long-term exposure to particulate air pollutants is discussed, emphasizing that life expectancy improved significantly in sites where air pollutants were controlled.},

In order to facilitate an effective outcome when teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene, educational interventions should first target school children. As computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools and ∼ 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many children had the required knowledge already before playing the game, this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first comprehensive evaluation of its kind. Future work includes a re-examination of the quiz-style questionnaires utilized in this study and an exploration of the potential knowledge change acquired strictly through engagement.},

 abstract = {Ozone is associated with health impacts including respiratory outcomes; however, results differ across studies. Meta-analysis is an increasingly important approach to synthesizing evidence across studies. We conducted meta-analysis of short-term ozone exposure and respiratory hospitalizations to evaluate variation across studies and explore some of the challenges in meta-analysis. We identified 136 estimates from 96 studies and investigated how estimates differed by age, ozone metric, season, lag, region, disease category, and hospitalization type. Overall results indicate associations between ozone and various types of respiratory hospitalizations; however, study characteristics affected risk estimates. Estimates were similar, but higher, for the elderly compared to all ages and for previous day exposure compared to same day exposure. Comparison across studies was hindered by variation in definitions of disease categories, as some (e.g., asthma) were identified through ≥3 different sets of ICD codes. Although not all analyses exhibited evidence of publication bias, adjustment for publication bias generally lowered overall estimates. Emergency hospitalizations for total respiratory disease increased 4.47% (95% interval 2.48, 6.50%) per 10ppb 24-hr ozone among the elderly without adjustment for publication bias and 2.97% (1.05, 4.94%) with adjustment. Comparison of multi-city study results and meta-analysis based on single-city studies further suggested publication bias.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological studies have consistently shown associations of exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) with severe health effects, including mortality and hospitalization, in adults. From the standpoints of both relative risk and attributable risk, the public health burden of ambient PM exposure is potentially greatest in elderly adults with underlying cardiopulmonary illness. Recent experimental data suggest that PM-borne transition metals have toxicity that could be mechanistically relevant to PM-related epidemiological findings. These data may prove to be especially relevant in elderly adults with cardiopulmonary illness. At the same time, important uncertainties remain in the epidemiological and experimental databases, such that the true degree of correspondence between the two is not yet known. In our opinion, this combination of emerging experimental-epidemiological coherence and remaining uncertainty imparts high priority to further research into the health effects of PM-borne transition metals. This research should not be confined to the respiratory system. Rather, it should examine the entire heart-lung axis and should probably consider other body systems (e.g. the vascular system) as well. In this research, close interdisciplinary communication should be sustained and experimental and epidemiological approaches should be coordinated to the maximum feasible extent.},

 abstract = {High ambient temperatures have been associated with increased mortality across the world. Several studies suggest that timely preventive measures may reduce heat-related excess mortality. The main aim of this study was to detect the temporal modification of heat-related mortality, in older adults (aged 65-74) and in elderly ≥75 years old, in the Florentine area by comparing previous (1999-2002) and subsequent (2004-2007) periods to the summer of 2003, when a regional Heat-Health Warning System (HHWS) was set up. Mortality data from 1999 to 2007 (May-September) were provided by the Mortality Registry of the Tuscany Region (n = 21,092). Weather data were used to assess daily apparent temperatures (AT). Case-crossover time-stratified designs and constrained segmented distributed lag models were applied. No significant heat-related mortality odds ratio (OR) variations were observed among the sub-periods. Nevertheless, a general OR decrease dating from 1999-2002 (OR 1.23; lack of HHWS) to 2004-2005 (OR 1.21; experimental HHWS running only for Florence) and to 2006-2007 (OR 1.12; official HHWS extended to the whole Florentine area) was observed when the maximum AT was considered. This modification was only evident in subjects ≥75 years old. The heat effect was higher and sustained for more days (until lag 9) during the period 1999-2002 than 2004-2007. The decrease of the excessive heat effect on mortality between periods with the absence and existence of a HHWS is also probably due to the mitigation of preventive measures and the implementation of a HHWS with specific interventions for safeguarding the health of the "frail elderly".},

In order to achieve optimal functioning people with a SD need to manage their illness and its impact; therefore, this study set out to determine the factors associated with self-management in this population. The illness management of people over 50 years of age and living with schizophrenia (n= 84) was compared with their peers who were diagnosed with a chronic physical illness (n= 216). Participants completed a survey that included an illness management inventory, self-rated health and sense of coherence. The results demonstrated that participants with a SD had lower illness management levels, particularly for understanding their symptoms and taking appropriate actions in relation to health care. Poor self-rated health and the presence of comorbid conditions had a pervasive negative effect on self-management factors in the SD group, whereas being married, having a greater sense of coherence and being voluntary to treatment had a positive effect. Nurses need to develop strategies to address general health and self-management in older adults living with a SD.},

 abstract = {The vitamin folate functions within the cell as a carrier of one-carbon units. The requirement for one-carbon transfers is ubiquitous and all mammalian cells carry out folate dependent reactions. In recent years, low folate status has been linked to risk of numerous adverse health conditions throughout life from birth defects and complications of pregnancy to cardiovascular disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. In many instances inadequate intake of folate seems to be the primary contributor but there is also evidence that an underlying genetic susceptibility can play a modest role by causing subtle alterations in the availability, metabolism or distribution of intermediates in folate related pathways. Folate linked one-carbon units are essential for DNA synthesis and repair and as a source of methyl groups for biological methylation reactions. The notion of common genetic variants being linked to risk of disease was relatively novel in 1995 when the first functional folate-related polymorphism was discovered. Numerous polymorphisms have now been identified in folate related genes and have been tested for functionality either as a modifier of folate status or as being associated with risk of disease. Moreover, there is increasing research into the importance of folate-derived one-carbon units for DNA and histone methylation reactions, which exert crucial epigenetic control over cellular protein synthesis. It is thus becoming clear that genetic aspects of folate metabolism are wide-ranging and may touch on events as disparate as prenatal imprinting to cancer susceptibility. This chapter will review the current knowledge in this area.},

 abstract = {Falling is one of the leading causes of serious health decline or injury-related deaths in the elderly. For survivors of a fall, the resulting health expenses can be a devastating burden, largely because of the long recovery time and potential comorbidities that ensue. The detection of a fall is, therefore, important in care of the elderly for decreasing the reaction time by the care-givers especially for those in care who are particularly frail or living alone. Recent advances in motion-sensor technology have enabled wearable sensors to be used efficiently for pervasive care of the elderly. In addition to fall detection, it is also important to determine the direction of a fall, which could help in the location of joint weakness or post-fall fracture. This work uses a waist-worn sensor, encompassing a 3D accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, for reliable fall detection and the determination of the direction of a fall. Also assessed is an efficient analysis framework suitable for on-node implementation using a low-power micro-controller that involves both feature extraction and fall detection. A detailed laboratory analysis is presented validating the practical application of the system.},

 abstract = {Short-term elevations in ambient fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) may increase resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, but whether PM(2.5) alters hemodynamic responses to orthostatic challenge has not been studied in detail. We repeatedly measured SBP and DBP during supine rest and 1 and 3 minutes after standing among 747 elderly (aged 78.3±5.3 years, mean±SD) participants from a prospective cohort study. We used linear mixed models to assess the association between change in SBP (ΔSBP=standing SBP-supine SBP) and DBP (ΔDBP) on standing and mean PM(2.5) levels over the preceding 1 to 28 days, adjusting for meteorologic covariates, temporal trends, and medical history. We observed a 1.4-mm Hg (95% CI: 0.0-2.8 mm Hg; P=0.046) higher ΔSBP and a 0.7-mm Hg (95% CI: 0.0-1.4 mm Hg; P=0.053) higher ΔDBP at 1 minute of standing per interquartile range increase (3.8 μg/m(3)) in mean PM(2.5) levels in the past 7 days. ΔSBP and ΔDBP measured 3 minutes after standing were not associated with PM(2.5). Resting DBP (but not SBP or pulse pressure) was positively associated with PM(2.5) at longer averaging periods. Responses were more strongly associated with black carbon than sulfate levels. These associations did not differ significantly according to hypertension status, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or sex. These results suggest that ambient particles can increase resting DBP and exaggerate blood pressure responses to postural changes in elderly people. Increased vasoreactivity during posture change may be responsible, in part, for the adverse effect of ambient particles on cardiovascular health.},

 abstract = {The effects of air pollution on health have been studied worldwide. Given that air pollution triggers oxidative stress and inflammation, it is plausible that high levels of air pollutants cause higher number of hospitalisations. This study aimed to assess the impact of air pollution on the emergency hospitalisation for respiratory disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study was divided in two parts: Part I specifically addressing the air pollution assessment and Part II addressing the health assessment. Accordingly, this Part II aimed to estimate the association between the concentrations of PM₁₀, SO₂ and CO observed in Rio de Janeiro and the number of emergency hospitalisations at a central hospital due to respiratory diseases. The pollutant concentrations were measured at two different sites in Rio de Janeiro, but the excess relative risks were calculated based on the concentrations observed at one of the sites, where limits were generally exceeded more frequently, between September 2000 and December 2005. A time series analysis was performed using the number of hospitalisations, divided in three categories (children until 1 year old, children aged between 1 and 5 years old and elderly with 65 years old or more) as independent variable, the concentrations of pollutants as dependent variables and temperature, relative humidity, long term trend, and seasonality as confounders. Data were analysed using generalised additive models with smoothing for some of the dependent variables. Results showed an excess risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disease higher than 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in PM₁₀ concentrations for children under 5 years old, of 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in SO₂ for elderly above 65 years old and around 0.1% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in CO for children under 1 year and elderly. Other studies have found associations that are in agreement with the results achieved in this study. The study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants experienced in Rio de Janeiro between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the number of hospitalisations for respiratory diseases among children and elderly.},

 abstract = {Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This adverse health effect is suggested to be mediated by inflammatory processes. The purpose of this study was to determine if low levels of particulate matter, typical for smaller cities, are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Fifty-two elderly individuals with ischemic heart disease were followed for six months with biweekly clinical visits in the city of Kotka, Finland. Blood samples were collected for the determination of inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon (IFN)γ, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase and white blood cell count. Particle number concentration and fine particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 μm (PM(2.5))) as well as thoracic particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters <10 μm (PM(10))) mass concentration were measured daily at a fixed outdoor measurement site. Light-absorbance of PM(2.5) filter samples, an indicator of combustion derived particles, was measured with a smoke-stain reflectometer. In addition, personal exposure to PM(2.5) was measured with portable photometers. During the study period, wildfires in Eastern Europe led to a 12-day air pollution episode, which was excluded from the main analyses. Average ambient PM(2.5) concentration was 8.7 μg/m(3). Of the studied pollutants, PM(2.5) and absorbance were most strongly associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers; most notably with C-reactive protein and IL-12 within a few days of exposure. There was also some evidence of an effect of particulate air pollution on fibrinogen and myeloperoxidase. The concentration of IL-12 was considerably (227%) higher during than before the forest fire episode. These findings show that even low levels of particulate air pollution from urban sources are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Also particles from wildfires may exhibit pro-inflammatory effects.},

 abstract = {Recent improvements in health and an increased standard of living in Oman have led to a reduction in environment-related and infectious diseases. Now the country is experiencing an epidemiological transition characterised by a baby boom, youth bulge and increasing longevity. Common wisdom would therefore suggest that Omanis will suffer less ill health. However, a survey of literature suggests that chronic non-communicable diseases are unexpectedly becoming common. This is possibly fuelled by some socio-cultural patterns specific to Oman, as well as the shortcomings of the 'miracle' of health and rapid modernisation. Unfortunately, such new diseases do not spare younger people; a proportion of them will need the type of care usually reserved for the elderly. In addition, due to their pervasive and refractory nature, these chronic non-communicable diseases seem impervious to the prevailing 'cure-oriented' health care system. This situation therefore calls for a paradigm shift: a health care system that goes beyond a traditional cure-orientation to provide care services for the chronically sick of all ages.},

 abstract = {Few multi-city studies in Asian developing countries have examined the acute health effects of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). In the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), we investigated the short-term association between NO(2) and mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for NO(2). In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. We combined the individual-city estimates of the concentration-response curves to get an overall NO(2)-mortality association in China. The averaged daily concentrations of NO(2) in the 17 Chinese cities ranged from 26 μg/m(3) to 67 μg/m(3). In the combined analysis, a 10-μg/m(3) increase in two-day moving averaged NO(2) was associated with a 1.63% [95% posterior interval (PI), 1.09 to 2.17], 1.80% (95% PI, 1.00 to 2.59) and 2.52% (95% PI, 1.44 to 3.59) increase of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for ambient particles or sulfur dioxide (SO(2)). Older people appeared to be more vulnerable to NO(2) exposure. The combined concentration-response curves indicated a linear association. Conclusively, this largest epidemiologic study of NO(2) in Asian developing countries to date suggests that short-term exposure to NO(2) is associated with increased mortality risk.},

 abstract = {The number of alpine accidents involving older trekkers has increased markedly in developed countries in recent years. More than 76.8% of the trekkers involved in alpine accidents in Japan were older than 40 years, with some experiencing a stroke or myocardial infarction while trekking at altitude. In the present study, we surveyed social trends in trekkers by interview at a popular mountain site, Mt Tanigawa (1963 m in altitude). The total number of trekkers interviewed was 511, and more than 60% of these were older than 40 years. Of trekkers older than 60 years, 42% complained of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. In 2 volunteer groups (10 younger subjects and 10 older subjects), physical condition was assessed before and after trekking. Significant body weight loss induced by dehydration was observed more often in older subjects than in younger subjects (P < .05). Balance, as measured using the Nintendo WiiFit (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan), worsened in the older group (P < .05). Local police records for 2009 showed that the total number of alpine accidents was 65. Injuries provoked by stumbling, slipping, and falling accounted for 51% of these, and 82% of casualties were older than 40 years, with 35% being older than 60 years. In conclusion, many older people involved in nonchallenging middle-altitude trekking have problems with regard to overall health and balance. Alpine accidents caused by myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypoglycemia tend to be more common in this population. Alpine rescue teams should be well prepared for this, and older trekkers should be made aware of their increased risk of injury in alpine settings.},

 abstract = {The growing number of elderly population at home and abroad necessitates improved approaches to elderly care provision. Elders, often with cognitive and physical impairment, need assistance in their activities of daily living (ADLs), which is usually provided by human caregivers. As the demand for caregivers assistance increases, the shortage of traditional care resources becomes obvious. In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a human caregiver to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt human caregiver depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the human caregiver but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregivers acceptance and their engagement.},

The potential consequences were illustrated in Europe in August 2003 when there were an estimated 30,000 excess deaths due to a heatwave. Electric fans might be used with the intention of reducing the adverse health effects of a heatwave. Fans do not cool the ambient air but can be used to draw in cooler air from outside when placed at an open window. The aim of the fans would be to increase heat loss by increasing the efficiency of all normal methods of heat loss, but particularly by evaporation and convection methods. However, it should be noted that increased sweating can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if these fluids and electrolytes are not replaced quickly enough. Research has also identified important gaps in knowledge about the use of fans, which might lead to their inappropriate use.},

For example, epidemiological studies of influenza indicate that elderly individuals, who face the highest mortality risk, are best protected by vaccination of young individuals, who contribute most to disease transmission. To examine the conditions under which young people would get vaccinated to protect elderly people, we conducted a game-theory experiment that mirrored real-world influenza transmission, with "young" players contributing more than "elderly" players to herd immunity. Participants could spend points to get vaccinated and reduce the risk of influenza. When players were paid according to individual point totals, more elderly than young players got vaccinated, a finding consistent with the Nash equilibrium predicting self-interested behavior. When players were paid according to group point totals, however, more young than elderly players got vaccinated-a finding consistent with the utilitarian equilibrium predicting group-optimal behavior-which resulted in higher point totals than when players were paid for their individual totals. Thus, payout structure affected whether individuals got vaccinated for self-interest or group benefit.},

 abstract = {Altitudes at which athletes compete or train do usually not exceed 2000-2500 m. At these moderate altitudes acute mountain sickness (AMS) is mild, transient and affects at the most 25% of a tourist population at risk. Unpublished data included in this review paper demonstrate that more intense physical activity associated with high-altitude training or mountaineering does not increase prevalence or severity of AMS at these altitudes. These conclusions can also be extended to the use of normobaric hypoxia, as data in this paper suggest that the severity of AMS is not significantly different between hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia at the same ambient pO(2). Furthermore, high-altitude cerebral or pulmonary oedema do not occur at these altitudes and intermittent exposure to considerably higher altitudes (4000-6000 m) used by athletes for hypoxic training are too short to cause acute high-altitude illnesses. Even moderate altitude between 2000 and 3000 m can, however, exacerbate cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or lead to a first manifestation of undiagnosed illness in older people that may belong to the accompanying staff of athletes. Moderate altitudes may also lead to splenic infarctions in healthy athletes with sickle cell trait.},

 abstract = {Enteric infections and diarrheal diseases constitute pervasive health burdens throughout the world, with rates being highest at the two ends of life. During the first 2-3 years of life, much of the disease burden may be attributed to infection with enteric pathogens including Salmonella, rotavirus, and many other bacterial, viral, and protozoan organisms; however, infections due to Clostridium difficile exhibit steady increases with age. Still others, like Campylobacter infections in industrialized settings are high in early life (<2 years old) and increase again in early adulthood (called the "second weaning" by some). The reasons for these differences undoubtedly reside in part in pathogen differences; however, host factors including the commensal intestinal microbial communities, immune responses (innate and acquired), and age-dependant shifts likely play important roles. Interplay of these factors is illustrated by studies examining changes in human gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Recent gut microbial surveys have indicated dramatic shifts in gut microbial population structure from infants to young adults to the elders. An understanding of the evolution of these factors and their interactions (e.g., how does gut microbiota modulate the "inflamm-aging" process or vice versa) through the human life "cycle" will be important in better addressing and controlling these enteric infections and their consequences for both quality and quantity of life (often assessed as disability adjusted life-years or "DALYs").},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to study how aged people experience mobile controlled game as a method of rehabilitation and recreation. The target group contained persons 70+ years of age living in assisted living conditions (N=34). The average age of the participants was 85.9 years. Women (n=17) and men (n=17) were equally presented in the sample group. Only 12 % (n=4) of participants were involved in an active weekly-based rehabilitation, light physical sitting exercises 38% (n=13). Three (n=3) of the participants (9%) used computers (net banking), and 20 (59%) used mobile phones on daily basis. Social activities and physical activation seem to be rather inadequate and traditional in assisted living organizations. The overall experiences of mobile controlled game described in this paper appeared to be a successful experiment also proving that the elderly are not as reluctant to use technical devices or playing virtual games as often thought. The game was reckoned very motivating, interesting, and entertaining both by the aged and the staff. Activation, rehabilitation and recreation in the elderly homes or assisted living organizations could benefit from utilization of new technology providing new ways and solutions that motivate the users and offer also possibilities for measuring and follow-up of the physical impacts. The future goals to improve the game were set according to the feedback given in this survey: a) wider variety of controlling modes for the game, b) developing various difficulty levels, c) developing the game to support different kinds of body movements, d) easily modified according to the individual user's exercising or rehabilitation needs as well as e) emphasizing the social aspects of the game by producing multiplayer versions.},

 abstract = {Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in office environments are generally too low to cause sensory irritation in the eyes and airways on the basis of estimated thresholds for sensory irritation. Furthermore, effects in the lungs, e.g. inflammatory effects, have not been substantiated at indoor relevant concentrations. Some VOCs, including formaldehyde, in combination may under certain environmental and occupational conditions result in reported sensory irritation. The odour thresholds of several VOCs are low enough to influence the perceived air quality that result in a number of acute effects from reported sensory irritation in eyes and airways and deterioration of performance. The odour perception (air quality) depends on a number of factors that may influence the odour impact. There is neither clear indication that office dust particles may cause sensory effects, even not particles spiked with glucans, aldehydes or phthalates, nor lung effects; some inflammatory effects may be observed among asthmatics. Ozone-initiated terpene reaction products may be of concern in ozone-enriched environments (≥0.1mg/m(3)) and elevated limonene concentrations, partly due to the production of formaldehyde. Ambient particles may cause cardio-pulmonary effects, especially in susceptible people (e.g. elderly and sick people); even, short-term effects, e.g. from traffic emission and candle smoke may possibly have modulating and delayed effects on the heart, but otherwise adverse effects in the airways and lung functions have not been observed. Secondary organic aerosols generated in indoor ozone-initiated terpene reactions appear not to cause adverse effects in the airways; rather the gaseous products are relevant. Combined exposure to particles and ozone may evoke effects in subgroups of asthmatics. Based on an analysis of thresholds for odour and sensory irritation selected compounds are recommended for measurements to assess the indoor air quality and to minimize reports of irritation symptoms, deteriorated performance, and cardiovascular and pulmonary effects.},

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of PM(10) on the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative stress biomarker, and the effect modification by genetic polymorphisms of eNOS, oxidative stress-related gene, in the 560 Korean elderly. We obtained urine samples repeatedly from participants during five medical examinations between 2008 and 2010 and all ambient air pollutant concentration data from the Korea National Institute of Environmental Research air quality monitoring system. We measured urinary levels of MDA to assess oxidative stress and genotyped eNOS (rs1799983, rs2853796, and rs7830). Mixed-effect model was used to estimate the effect of PM(10) on the level of oxidative stress biomarker and their modification by genotypes. PM(10) showed apparent positive effect on MDA level after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, cotinine level, temperature, dew point, levels of SO(2), O(3), NO(2), and CO, and season (p=0.0133). Moreover, the association of PM(10) with MDA was found only in participants with eNOS GG genotype for rs1799983 (p=0.0107), TT genotype for rs2853796 (p=0.0289), or GT genotype for rs7830 (p=0.0158) and in participants with a set of risky haplotypes (GTT, GTG, GGT, and TGT) (p=0.0093).

 abstract = {One quarter of Americans will be older than 80 by 2030, and hypertension in this group will be ubiquitous. Most studies of hypertension exclude octogenarians and are not able to be generalized because of differences in physiologic and social phenomena. This review evaluates the existing literature in an effort to identify unresolved issues and guide future areas of investigation. Hypertension has been well characterized in adults and the young elderly, and the focus is on optimizing treatment regimens. However, research specifically involving this rapidly growing minority is sparse. Most studies are still trying to characterize blood pressure goals, and only one major series has begun to evaluate treatment options. Based on available evidence, it appears that an appropriate blood pressure goal may be somewhat higher in octogenarians and that thiazide diuretics may be the initial treatment of choice.},

 abstract = {Social and decision-making deficits are often the first symptoms of a striking number of neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging. These includes not only disorders that directly impact dopamine and basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disorder, but also degeneration in which multiple neural pathways are affected over the course of normal aging. The impact of such deficits can be dramatic, as in cases of financial fraud, which disproportionately affect the elderly. Unlike memory and motor impairments, however, which are readily recognized as symptoms of more serious underlying neurological conditions, social and decision-making deficits often do not elicit comparable concern in the elderly. Furthermore, few behavioral measures exist to quantify these deficits, due in part to our limited knowledge of the core cognitive components or their neurobiological substrates. Here we probe age-related differences in decision-making using a game theory paradigm previously shown to dissociate contributions of basal ganglia and prefrontal regions to behavior. Combined with computational modeling, we provide evidence that age-related changes in elderly participants are driven primarily by an over-reliance in trial-and-error reinforcement learning that does not take into account the strategic context, which may underlie cognitive deficits that contribute to social vulnerability in elderly individuals.},

Evidence suggests that one in 10 older adults experiences some form of elder abuse, but only one in 25 cases is reported to social services agencies. At the same time, elder abuse is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Despite these findings, there is a great paucity in research, practice, and policy addressing the pervasive issues of elder abuse. Through my experiences as a American Political Sciences Association Congressional Policy Fellow and Health and Aging Policy Fellow working with the Administration on Community Living (ACL) (previously known as the Administration on Aging) for the last 2 years, I will describe the major functions of the ACL and highlight two major pieces of federal legislation: The Older Americans Act and the Elder Justice Act.

Under Art 12 of the Convention, moves to supported decision-making will result in significant changes in ensuring the rights of people with dementia. There are challenges ahead in implementing supported decision-making schemes, not only due to tension with existing practices and legislation, but also the difficulty of developing and resourcing workable schemes.

A retrospective case-control study of ED presentations at an Australian metropolitan hospital from September 2005 to May 2010 was undertaken. Cases comprised 1297 ED presentations surrounding heat threshold days. These were compared with randomly selected presentations on nonthreshold days (3 controls: 1 case), analyzing patient morbidity and ED function variables: triage category, presenting complaint, demographics, arrival mode, time to doctor, ED length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and discharge diagnoses. A greater proportion of cases presented with "weakness," and were diagnosed with "dehydration." There was little effect on ED function, with ED LOS 24 minutes longer for cases and time to doctor 3 minutes shorter. This study found limited evidence of increased morbidity in the elderly during heat wave conditions.},

 abstract = {In Viet Nam, household direct out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure as a share of the total health expenditure has been always high, ranging from 50% to 70%. The high share of OOP expenditure has been linked to different inequity problems such as catastrophic health expenditure (households must reduce their expenditure on other necessities) and impoverishment. This paper aims to examine catastrophic and poverty impacts of household out-of-pocket health expenditure in Viet Nam over time and identify socio-economic indicators associated with them. Data used in this research were obtained from a nationally representative household survey, Viet Nam Living Standard Survey 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The findings revealed that there were problems in health care financing in Viet Nam - many households encountered catastrophic health expenditure and/or were pushed into poverty due to health care payments. The issues were pervasive over time. Catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment problems were more common among the households who had more elderly people and those located in rural areas. Importantly, the financial protection aspect of the national health insurance schemes was still modest. Given these findings, more attention is needed on developing methods of financial protection in Viet Nam.},

 abstract = {We review sex differences in the relationship between habitual physical activity and health in the elderly, with particular reference to pedometer/accelerometer data from the Nakanojo Study. Maximal aerobic power, walking speed and habitual physical activity are 10-30% greater in men than in women. This reflects not only biological but also socio-cultural and environmental factors, with the latter becoming dominant as age advances. It implies a need for sex-specific thresholds of moderate activity. Overall health is associated with both the year-averaged daily step count (the best indicator in women) and the year-averaged daily duration of physical activity >3 metabolic equivalents (METs) (the best indicator in men). In both sexes, the threshold ranges of step count and/or duration of activity >3 METs associated with a reduced prevalence of health problems are: 4000-5000 steps/day and/or 5-7.5 min/day for impaired mental and psychosocial health, such as a depressed mood state and a poor health-related quality of life; 7000-8000 steps/day and/or 15-20 min/day for markers of aortic arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia and poor physical fitness; and 8000-10,000 steps/day and/or 20-30 min/day for components of the metabolic syndrome, especially hypertension and hyperglycemia. Irrespective of sex, both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by stressful life events, such as a partner's death, and immediate meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature, underlining the need for long-term measurement of activity patterns. These findings have practical implications for those who engage in epidemiological studies and/or design health promotional programs for the elderly.},

Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

In this study, we specifically evaluated the users' intention of using the iFit using a technology acceptance model (TAM). A total of 101 elderly subjects (27 males and 74 females) were recruited. A survey was conducted to measure technology acceptance, to verify that the platform could be used as intended to promote fitness among the elderly. Results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and usage attitude positively impact behavioral intention to use the platform. The iFit platform can offer user-friendly solutions for a community-based fitness care and monitoring of elderly subjects. In summary, iFit was determined by three key drivers and discussed as follows: risk factors among the frail elderly, mechanism for slowing the advance frailty, and technology acceptance and support for promoting physical fitness.},

Patients who used cooling systems ("users") were compared with those who did not ("non-users") regarding mortality, clinical outcome of primary illness (improvement or deterioration), and emergency hospitalization. Prospectively collected data were available for 339 individual elderly febrile patients. "Users" had lower mortality (10 % vs. 19 %, p < 0.05) than "non-users"; no difference was noted on clinical improvement (85 % vs. 76 %, p = 0.11) and emergency hospitalization rates (21 % vs. 30 %, p = 0.16). No difference was noted between users of air-conditioning and fan regarding mortality or clinical improvement, but fan use was associated with more hospitalizations (37 % vs. 19 %, p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis (assessing daily ambient temperature, use of cooling systems, patient age, and living conditions), the sole variable significantly associated with mortality was the non-use of cooling systems [odds ratio (OR): 2.18, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.06-4.50]. The use of air-conditioning or fan during hot summer periods appeared to be beneficial for elderly febrile patients living in a large city. Large prospective studies are warranted in order to provide further insight into potential individual and public health initiatives aiming to alleviate the impact of excess summer heat on the health of elderly patients.},

 abstract = {With an ever-growing ageing population, dementia is fast becoming the chronic disease of the 21st century. Elderly people affected with dementia progressively lose their autonomy as they encounter problems in their Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Hence, they need supervision and assistance from their family members or professional caregivers, which can often lead to underestimated psychological and financial stress for all parties. The use of Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies aims to empower people with dementia and relieve the burden of their caregivers.The aim of this paper is to present the approach we have adopted to develop and deploy a system for ambient assistive living in an operating nursing home, and evaluate its performance and usability in real conditions. Based on this approach, we emphasise on the importance of deployments in real world settings as opposed to prototype testing in laboratories.},

 abstract = {With the increase of an ageing population and chronic diseases, society becomes more health conscious and patients become "health consumers" looking for better health management. People's perception is shifting towards patient-centered, rather than the classical, hospital-centered health services which has been propelling the evolution of telemedicine research from the classic e-Health to m-Health and now is to ubiquitous healthcare (u-Health). It is expected that mobile & ubiquitous Telemedicine, integrated with Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), have a great potential in fostering the provision of next-generation u-Health. Despite the recent efforts and achievements, current u-Health proposed solutions still suffer from shortcomings hampering their adoption today. This paper presents a comprehensive review of up-to-date requirements in hardware, communication, and computing for next-generation u-Health systems. It compares new technological and technical trends and discusses how they address expected u-Health requirements. A thorough survey on various worldwide recent system implementations is presented in an attempt to identify shortcomings in state-of-the art solutions. In particular, challenges in WBAN and ubiquitous computing were emphasized. The purpose of this survey is not only to help beginners with a holistic approach toward understanding u-Health systems but also present to researchers new technological trends and design challenges they have to cope with, while designing such systems.},

Local food production as a substitute to imports would be an adaptive response, but enhancement of food security via food localization requires reflection on previous failings of conventional agricultural strategies so that informed decisions can be made. In light of potential reintroduction of local food production in remote First Nations communities, we investigated the cultural, social and ecological effects of a 20th century, Euro-Canadian agrarian settlement on the food system of a subarctic First Nation; this will act as the first step in developing a more sustainable local food program and enhancing food security in this community.},

 abstract = {Japan is still "intermediate burden" country as medium-incidence of tuberculosis (TB). But the incidence of TB varies by public health units. The priority for TB control would be lowering in the areas where the incidence of TB is relatively low. In addition, younger age groups get low prevalence of TB infection than elderly persons. As a result, fewer experiences for TB diagnosis and treatment in the hospital and the medical facility would cause the delay in the detection of TB patients which eventually cause outbreaks. Although there are differences in population density and population mobility between urban and rural areas, the socially economic vulnerable patients and foreign patients are the common risks. Any public health units' policies of TB should correspond to the individual situation. At the era of low tuberculosis incidence, the infection risk is to be "From ubiquitous to the uneven distribution". This makes TB detection much more difficult. At this symposium, each speaker presented the case for actually experienced with QFT test and/or VNTR analysis. They mainly focused on the paradigm shift in TB control which is indispensable for resolving the gaps in regional differences and the differences in diagnostic capability. Although the cases in this symposium were not for the low incidence situation, the pioneering approaches presented here would boost the future application of QFT and VNTR analysis nationwide. The discussions also partially covered the technical infrastructure for molecular epidemiology which covers the whole country. By making full use of QFT test and VNTR analysis as a contact screening tool, we can appropriately understand the risk of TB infection in the region from a buildup of bacteria and patient information. Now is the time to prepare for. Active surveillance of TB by this way would clarify the risk of the disease and lead to the advocacy essential for the resolution. 1. Current situation and challenge of contact survey by using QFT test in Tokyo: Hideo MAEDA (Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Government). 2. Contact investigation of a tuberculosis outbreak: Kenichi MIYAMOTO (Takaido Community Health Center). We have experienced a TB outbreak in integrated junior and senior high school in Tokyo. Index patient was a student with persistent respiratory symptoms for six months before diagnosis of sputum smear-positive TB. Public health center started contact investigation immediately. QFT-positive rates were high in close contacts, especially in classmates. Additionally, a student outside of contact investigation was diagnosed as TB and considered to be infected from the first patient by VNTR analysis. Therefore, public health center expanded QFT-tests to all students and teachers in this school. Finally, 9 students and 2 teachers in this school were diagnosed as sputum smear-negative TB by contact investigation. 3. Utilization of molecular epidemiological procedure in contact investigation in Kyoto City: Masahiro ITO (Public Health Center of Kyoto City) Molecular epidemiological procedure using VNTR analysis has been used for contact investigation of tuberculosis since January 2011 in Kyoto City. One hundred forty four strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients with tuberculosis were investigated and 130 strains were fully analyzed. Fourteen clusters were found and the number of strains included in the cluster was ranged from two to 11. Epidemiological relationship between patients in one cluster was found, however, significant relationship in another clusters was not demonstrated. It was suggested that VNTR analysis is useful for molecular epidemiological analysis of tuberculosis. 4. The population based molecular epidemiological studies and QFT test in a contact examination: Riyo FUJIYAMA, Keisuke MATSUBAYASHI, Setsuko MIZUSHIRI, Junko HIGUCHIL Chika SHIRAI, Yuko KATAGAMI, Mieko CHIHARA, Akihiro IJICHI (Kobe City Public Health Center), Kentaro ARIKAWA, Noriko NAKANISHI, Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health). The population based molecular epidemiological studies should be made good use of contacts examination. In future, we expect the tuberculosis molecular epdimiological study improve search for the process of tuberculosis infection. The QFT positive rates correlated well with closeness of contact. QFT test is considered useful for diagnosing tuberculosis infection. However, in the judgment of tuberculosis infection, we should consider the total result of contact investigation not only QFT test but also the contact situation. 5. Insights into the TB epidemiology through population based molecular epidemiological studies: Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health) The population based molecular epidemiological studies unveiled the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis at bacterial clone level. This provides scientific evidences for achieving better TB control programs. In the advanced stage of the tuberculosis molecular epidemiological study, we expect to change the current geno-typing based molecular epidemiology to whole genome-typing based molecular epidemiology on the basis of the rapid innovation of next-generation sequencing technology.},

To achieve these goals, we started by performing a study of the specific characteristics of the senior user as well as what makes a game appealing to the player. Furthermore we investigated why the tablet proves to be an advantageous device to our target audience. Based on the results of our research, we developed a solution that incorporates cognitive and social mechanisms into its games, while performing iterative evaluations together with the final user by adopting a user-centered design methodology. In each design phase, a pre-selected group of senior participants experimented with the game platform and provided feedback to improve its features and usability. Through a series of short-term and a long-term evaluation, the game platform proved to be appealing to its intended users, providing an enjoyable gaming experience.},

Change score analyses indicated the intervention group had significantly greater increases in bicep curl muscular endurance, physical activity levels, and psychological quality of life than the control group (p < .05). Analysis of the quotes underlying the 3 themes (feeling silly, feeling good; having fun; and something to look forward to) suggested that intervention group participants developed a sense of empowerment and achievement after some initial reluctance and anxiousness. They felt that the games were fun and provided an avenue for greater socialization. These results add some further support to the utilization of NWS exergames in the RAC context.},

 abstract = {Adolescence is a sensitive period of time for developing social abilities such as cognitive empathy. Thus, social experiences in this time period are more influential in forming the social abilities than during other periods in life. Video games are agent-based media in which game players carry out their own action in a mediated world whose rules are predefined by algorithms. This means that game players do not have to engage their cognitive empathy when playing games. Thus, prolonged use of video games during adolescence can result in the underdevelopment of cognitive empathy. This survey from three age groups (adolescents aged 16-19, adults aged 37-41, elders aged 58-62) demonstrated that only among adolescents was the amount of time spent in game play negatively associated with cognitive empathy. The findings of this study can contribute to understanding the nature of video game play and its negative effects by focusing on the manner of media use rather than the messages in media, and focusing on cognitive empathy, which has rarely been examined.},

 abstract = {Digital technologies are becoming more pervasive in all areas of society. Enabling everyone to have access and capability to use the Internet and associated digital technologies, summed up in the term 'digital inclusion', is seen to have wide-ranging benefits to the individual, to the economy and to society. For older people, being digitally included can help them to maintain their independence, social connectedness and sense of worth in the face of declining health or limited capabilities, as well as also offering new opportunities to improve their quality of life. At present however, access to the technology and to the benefits is not equally distributed either between or within nations, and older people tend to be on the 'wrong' side of what is termed the 'digital divide'. Governments globally are developing strategies to promote digital inclusion and indeed Internet uptake is increasing steadily, including amongst older people. However, such strategies have focussed on getting people online, and there appears to be an assumption that once someone is online they will remain 'digitally engaged'. In fact statistics show that some users give up using the Internet, and there is emerging evidence that older people are more vulnerable to the factors which can lead to this outcome. The authors see this phenomenon as a potential but largely unrecognised 'fourth digital divide' which has serious implications for social inclusion. The objectives of this article are (a) to raise awareness of the phenomenon of digital disengagement by considering some of the emerging evidence, (b) to explore some of the potential implications of not recognising and therefore not addressing the needs of the digitally disengaged older population, and (c) to reveal the prevailing gap in knowledge which future research should address.},

The Domeo-project of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme of the European Union aims to develop a new companion robotic system that would allow assistance to the elderly. The requirements and attitude of the potential users and caregivers have been assessed in Austria, France and Hungary. The robot functions were demonstrated to the participants. Three focus groups were formed: potential end users, older caregivers and younger caregivers. The discussions were recorded and processed according to six aspects: (i) acceptability and privacy, (ii) pertinence of services, (iii) possible obstacles, (iv) motivation level to use the proposed services, (v) organizational issues and (vi) recommendations. Minor differences were observed between the countries, but there were considerable differences regarding the age of the participants. The younger caregivers want to be assured of the safety of their client and to receive immediate notification in case of an emergency. As for the elderly, the most important aspect is to gain a companion and a physical helper. Many of the recommendations can be taken into consideration during robot development, but some of them are not realistic at present.},

We sought to identify literacy-related challenges that older adults experience while managing their health. We interviewed 8 nurses who provided direct care to older adult populations. Thematic analysis was conducted exploring barriers, strategies and resources as they relate to health literacy in older adults. Three main themes were identified: literacy barriers, aging process and social resources. Problems associated with health literacy in this population were pervasive. Numeracy, a component of health literacy, was a central factor for a range of medication management problems. However, nurses reported that they were able to fashion solutions that enabled patients to comprehend quantitative information and act on it accordingly, resulting in better health management.},

 abstract = {As the elderly population has been rapidly expanding and the core tax-paying population has been shrinking, the need for adequate elderly health and housing services continues to grow while the resources to provide such services are becoming increasingly scarce. Thus, increasing the efficiency of the delivery of healthcare services through the use of modern technology is a pressing issue. The seamless integration of such enabling technologies as ontology, intelligent agents, web services, and cloud computing is transforming healthcare from hospital-based treatments to home-based self-care and preventive care. A ubiquitous healthcare platform based on this technological integration, which synergizes service providers with patients' needs to be developed to provide personalized healthcare services at the right time, in the right place, and the right manner. This paper presents the development and overall architecture of IAServ (the Intelligent Aging-in-place Home care Web Services Platform) to provide personalized healthcare service ubiquitously in a cloud computing setting to support the most desirable and cost-efficient method of care for the aged-aging in place. The IAServ is expected to offer intelligent, pervasive, accurate and contextually-aware personal care services. Architecturally the implemented IAServ leverages web services and cloud computing to provide economic, scalable, and robust healthcare services over the Internet.},

 abstract = {The purposes of this present research were, in the first study, to determine whether age impacts a measure of postural control (the braking force in walking) and, in a second study, to determine whether exergame training in physically-simulated sport activity would show transfer, increasing the braking force in walking and also improving balance assessed by clinical measures, functional fitness, and health-related quality of life in older adults. For the second study, the authors developed an active video game training program (using the Wii system) with a pretest-training-posttest design comparing an experimental group (24 1-hr sessions of training) with a control group. Participants completed a battery comprising balance (braking force in short and normal step conditions), functional fitness (Senior Fitness Test), and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Results show that 12 weeks of video game-based exercise program training improved the braking force in the normal step condition, along with the functional fitness of lower limb strength, cardiovascular endurance, and motor agility, as measured by the Senior Fitness Test. Only the global mental dimension of the SF-36 was sensitive to exergame practice. Exergames appear to be an effective way to train postural control in older adults. Because of the multimodal nature of the activity, exergames provide an effective tool for remediation of age-related problems.},

 abstract = {Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted.},

 abstract = {Elder abuse, also called elder mistreatment or elder maltreatment, includes psychological, physical, and sexual abuse, neglect (caregiver neglect and self-neglect), and financial exploitation. Evidence suggests that 1 out of 10 older adults experiences some form of elder abuse, and only a fraction of cases are actually reported to social services agencies. At the same time, elder abuse is independently associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Despite these findings, there is a great paucity in research, practice, and policy dealing with this pervasive issue. In this paper, I review the epidemiology of elder abuse as well as key practical issues in dealing with the cases of elder abuse. Through my experiences as a Congressional Policy Fellow/National Health and Aging Policy Fellow, I highlight key previsions on 2 major federal legislations dealing with the issues of elder abuse: Older Americans Act (OAA) and Elder Justice Act (EJA). Lastly, I highlight major research gaps and future policy relevant research directions to advance the field of elder abuse. Interdisciplinary and community-based efforts are needed to devise effective strategies to detect, treat, and prevent elder abuse in our increasingly diverse aging populations. Collective advocacy and policy advances are needed to create a national infrastructure to protect the vulnerable older adults.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a malaria knowledge test (MKT) developed to evaluate a web-based game for students who increasingly travel to malaria-risk regions of the world. The 18-item MKT was structured according to the dimensions of the self-regulation model (SRM) to measure the accuracy of students' beliefs about malaria. An experimental design was used to compare three game versions. Students (N=482) participated in 2010 by completing a pre-test, playing a Web-based game simulating student travel to malaria-endemic destinations, and completing a post-test. Study data support the validity and reliability of the MKT for the evaluation of malaria education interventions and for student self-assessment. Use of the MKT to evaluate an educational game about malaria revealed a strong overall learning effect and discrimination by game version, travel experience, and SRM dimension. This 5-min test may also be adapted for educational outreach purposes among health care providers globally, residents of malaria-endemic regions, and other high risk travel groups (e.g., elderly, chronic health conditions, pregnant, or returning to malaria-endemic regions to visit friends/relatives).},

 abstract = {Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous opportunities for the implementation of ubiquitous health care systems in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against abnormal conditions. This helps with the automatic and remote monitoring/tracking of patients in hospitals and facilitates and with the supervision of fragile, elderly people in their own domestic environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug delivery. This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for the multipatient positioning in a wireless body area network (WBAN) which exploits the spatial sparsity of patients and a sparse fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based feature extraction mechanism for monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a central database server containing patient vital information. The main goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and resolution in the patient localization with less computational complexity in the implementation using the compressive sensing theory. We represent the patients' positions as a sparse vector obtained by the discrete segmentation of the patient movement space in a circular grid. To estimate this vector, a compressive-sampling-based two-level FFT (CS-2FFT) feature vector is synthesized for each received signal from the biosensors embedded on the patient's body at each grid point. This feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both short-time and long-time properties of the received signals. The robustness of the proposed CS-2FFT-based algorithm in terms of the average positioning error is numerically evaluated using the realistic parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6-WBAN standard in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the circular grid pattern and the CS-2FFT feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a significant reduction in the computational complexity, while improving the level of the resolution and the localization accuracy when compared to some classical CS-based positioning algorithms.},

 abstract = {Health game research has flourished over the last decade. The number of peer-reviewed scientific publications has surged as the clinical application of health games has diversified. In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer-reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user-game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user-game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

 abstract = {Golf has been recommended as a relatively risk-free form of exercise for an ageing population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of playing a round of golf on mood states in recreational players. Ageing male golfers (N = 34; Age: M = 68.7, SD = 5.4 years) completed a mood measure immediately before and after an 18-hole round of golf. Distance walked per game was measured using a pedometer. Results indicate reported scores on Anger, Depression, and Fatigue increased and Vigor reduced following the game. However, it should be noted that although there was an increase in unpleasant mood states, this should be seen in the context of the overall mood profile, which was positive. Pedometer results indicated golfers walked a mean distance of 10.21 km (± 1.11). Results show participants of this age-group engaged in a meaningful exercise session and that mood scores deteriorated following play. Findings from the present study show that elderly golfers experienced mood profiles following golf similar to younger athletes following competition. For golf to be recommended as an activity for promoting physical activity among an aging population, the player's ability to regulate unpleasant mood states should be considered. Future research should investigate the effects of experiencing negative mood states following golf on motivation to participate. Key PointsFindings show ageing male golfers engaged in a meaningful exercise session and that mood scores deteriorated following play.Mood profiles before and after playing golf for elderly golfers were similar to younger athletes following competition.For golf to be recommended as an activity for promoting physical activity among an aging population, the player's ability to regulate unpleasant mood states should be considered.},

 abstract = {This brief review is based on a President's Lecture presented at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in 2013. The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of climate change and consequent increases in environmental heat stress on the aging cardiovascular system. The earth's average global temperature is slowly but consistently increasing, and along with mean temperature changes come increases in heat wave frequency and severity. Extreme passive thermal stress resulting from prolonged elevations in ambient temperature and prolonged physical activity in hot environments creates a high demand on the left ventricle to pump blood to the skin to dissipate heat. Even healthy aging is accompanied by altered cardiovascular function, which limits the extent to which older individuals can maintain stroke volume, increase cardiac output, and increase skin blood flow when exposed to environmental extremes. In the elderly, the increased cardiovascular demand during heat waves is often fatal because of increased strain on an already compromised left ventricle. Not surprisingly, excess deaths during heat waves 1) occur predominantly in older individuals and 2) are overwhelmingly cardiovascular in origin. Increasing frequency and severity of heat waves coupled with a rapidly growing at-risk population dramatically increase the extent of future untoward health outcomes.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the AAL field with a focus on healthcare frameworks, platforms, standards, and quality attributes. To achieve this, we conducted a literature survey of state-of-the-art AAL frameworks, systems and platforms to identify the essential aspects of AAL systems and investigate the critical issues from the design, technology, quality-of-service, and user experience perspectives. In addition, we conducted an email-based survey for collecting usage data and current status of contemporary AAL systems. We found that most AAL systems are confined to a limited set of features ignoring many of the essential AAL system aspects. Standards and technologies are used in a limited and isolated manner, while quality attributes are often addressed insufficiently. In conclusion, we found that more inter-organizational collaboration, user-centered studies, increased standardization efforts, and a focus on open systems is needed to achieve more interoperable and synergetic AAL solutions.},

The mitochondrial life cycle, comprising biogenesis, fusion/fission events and mitophagic elimination, is carefully orchestrated, and age-related decay of the lifecycle contributes to chronic degenerative diseases. Mitochondria make contacts with other cellular organelles in the endomembrane system (endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes and lysosomes) whose dynamics are co-regulated and interactions finely tuned to meet the cell requirements and maintain the health of the organism. This review will consider the evidence that mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control, as well as the complex interplay among cellular organelles, may be affected by the aging process(es), with negative consequences for the well being of elderly individuals. Moreover, we propose that nutrients or drugs able to maintain organelle homeostasis may represent novel preventive and/or therapeutic approaches for chronic age-related diseases.},

 abstract = {Identifying and characterizing urban vulnerability to heat is a key step in designing intervention strategies to combat negative consequences of extreme heat on human health. This study combines excess non-accidental mortality counts, numerical weather simulations, US Census and parcel data into an assessment of vulnerability to heat in Houston, Texas. Specifically, a hierarchical model with spatially varying coefficients is used to account for differences in vulnerability among census block groups. Socio-economic and demographic variables from census and parcel data are selected via a forward selection algorithm where at each step the remaining variables are orthogonalized with respect to the chosen variables to account for collinearity. Daily minimum temperatures and composite heat indices (e.g. discomfort index) provide a better model fit than other ambient temperature measurements (e.g. maximum temperature, relative humidity). Positive interactions between elderly populations and heat exposure were found suggesting these populations are more responsive to increases in heat.},

 abstract = {The percentage of elderly people in European countries is increasing. Such conjuncture affects socio-economic structures and creates demands for resourceful solutions, such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which is a possible methodology to foster health care for elderly people. In this context, sensor-based devices play a leading role in surveying, e.g., health conditions of elderly people, to alert care personnel in case of an incident. However, the adoption of such devices strongly depends on the comfort of wearing the devices. In most cases, the bottleneck is the battery lifetime, which impacts the effectiveness of the system. In this paper we propose an approach to reduce the energy consumption of sensors' by use of local sensors' intelligence. By increasing the intelligence of the sensor node, a substantial decrease in the necessary communication payload can be achieved. The results show a significant potential to preserve energy and decrease the actual size of the sensor device units.},

 abstract = {A probiotic dairy product was developed on the basis of a traditional dish called mutandabota to enable resource-poor populations in southern Africa to benefit from a functional food. Mutandabota is widely consumed in rural southern Africa, making it an ideal food matrix to carry probiotics. First, a process to produce probiotic mutandabota was designed. Raw cow milk was boiled and subsequently cooled to ambient temperature (25°C). Next, dry pulp from the fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) was added to the milk at a concentration of 4% (wt/vol). This mixture was inoculated with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba and left to ferment for 24h, while the growth of the bacterial culture was monitored. Final ingredients were then added to produce probiotic mutandabota that had 14% (wt/vol) baobab fruit pulp and 7% (wt/vol) sugar in cow milk. The pH of probiotic mutandabota was pH 3.5, which ensures that the product is microbiologically safe. The viable plate count of L. rhamnosus yoba increased from 5.8 ± 0.3 log cfu/mL at the point of inoculation to 8.8 ± 0.4 log cfu/mL at the moment of consumption, thereby meeting the criterion to have a viable count of the probiotic bacterium in excess of 6 log cfu/mL of a product. Baobab fruit pulp at 4% promoted growth of L. rhamnosus yoba with a maximal specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.6 ± 0.2/h at 30°C. The developed technology, though specific for this particular product, has potential to be applied for the delivery of probiotics through a variety of indigenous foods in different regions of the world. Upon consumption, probiotic mutandabota is expected to improve the population's intestinal health, which is especially relevant for vulnerable target groups such as children and elderly people.},

 abstract = {Ageing is a natural phenomenon and an inevitable process. Population ageing is pervasive since it is creating humanitarian, social and economic problems in many countries of the world including Nepal. Nepalese society is in a phase of modernization. There is modification in the cultural norms and traditional family support systems for elderly in Nepal which have placed substantial strain in caring elderly people. In Nepal, there were 1.5 million in 2001 and 2.1 million in 2011, elderly inhabitants, which constitute 6.5 percent and 8.1% of the total population in the country. During the years 1991-2001, the annual elderly population growth rate was 3.39 percent, higher than the annual population growth rate of 2.3 percent. Growing numbers of elderly people are suffering problems in different aspect, but there are limited studies in relation to general morbidities as well as specific in this group of people. The government of Nepal has formulated a National policy, act and regulations on ageing and the problems of elderly; however, this has not been operationalised because of limited resources. In this background of problems that elderly people are facing and government slow initiatives, this paper is illustrated with the objective to explore the different dimensions of ageing and health and health related services for aging people in Nepal using different information for the purpose of further concrete steps in the benefits for elders.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Background: Previous studies have identified a number of psychosocial risk factors of dysregulated cortisol (frequently referred to as the "stress hormone") among older adults with depression. However, these studies have typically only examined a handful of risk factors at a time and have sometimes yielded inconsistent results. Method: This study aims to address this gap in the literature by simultaneously examining a range of relevant psychosocial predictors of diurnal cortisol among 54 older adults with a depressive disorder. Salivary cortisol was assessed upon awakening, at 5 PM, and at 9 PM across two consecutive days. Participants also completed measures of global psychosocial stress, current psychiatric symptomatology, pervasive distress (e.g. history of past depression), and protective factors (e.g. social support, resiliency, extent to which one has "made sense" of a significant stressor). Results: High levels of current depressive symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, past depressive episodes, trait anxiety, and poorer ability to make sense of one's stress were found to be associated with flatter (more abnormal) cortisol slopes. However, when all of these variables were entered simultaneously in a multiple regression analysis, only history of past depression and the degree of sense made of stress emerged as unique predictors of cortisol in the model. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for identifying depressed elderly individuals with dysregulated cortisol patterns who may be most at risk for health complications. Treatments that aim to limit the chronicity of depression and help to increase the sense made of stress could potentially have a positive impact on health.},

Nevertheless, the extant literature on mobile information technology diffusion and adoption has predominantly focused on organizations and individuals as the unit of analysis, with little emphasis on the environment in which healthcare organizations are embedded. We propose the social worlds approach as a promising theoretical lens for dealing with this limitation together with reports from a case study of a mobile information technology innovation in elderly home care in Denmark including both the sociopolitical and organizational levels in the analysis. Using the notions of social worlds, trajectories, and boundary objects enables us to show how mobile information technology innovation in Danish home care can facilitate negotiation and collaboration across different social worlds in one setting while becoming a source of tension and conflicts in others. The trajectory of mobile information technology adoption was shaped by influential stakeholders in the Danish home care sector. Boundary objects across multiple social worlds legitimized the adoption, but the use arrangement afforded by the new technology interfered with important aspects of home care practices, creating resistance among the healthcare personnel.},

The current study examines the question of whether a learning situation that emphasises collaborative social interaction might help older persons overcome age-related learning and memory changes and thus perform similarly to younger persons. Younger and Older participants (n = 34 in each group) completed the Barrier Task (BT), a game-like social interaction where partners work together to develop labels for a set of abstract tangrams. Participants were also administered standard clinical neuropsychological measures of memory, on which the Older group showed expected inferiority to the Younger group. On the BT, the Older group performed less well than the Younger group early on, but as the task progressed, the performance of the Older group caught up and became statistically indistinguishable from that of the Younger group. These results can be taken to suggest that a learning milieu characterised by collaborative social interaction can attenuate some of the typical memory disadvantages associated with being older.},

 abstract = {Many studies probing the link between air quality and health have pointed towards associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and decreased lung function, aggravation of respiratory diseases like asthma, premature death and increased hospitalisation admissions for the elderly and individuals with cardiopulmonary diseases. Of recent, it is believed that the chemical composition and physical properties of PM may contribute significantly to these adverse health effects. As part of a Belgian Science Policy project ("Health effects of particulate matter in relation to physical-chemical characteristics and meteorology"), the chemical composition (elemental and ionic compositions) and physical properties (PM mass concentrations) of PM were investigated, indoors and outdoors of old age homes in Antwerp. The case reported here specifically relates to high versus normal/low pollution event periods. PM mass concentrations for PM1 and PM2.5 fractions were determined gravimetrically after collection via impaction. These same samples were hence analysed by EDXRF spectrometry and IC for their elemental and ionic compositions, respectively. During high pollution event days, PM mass concentrations inside the old age home reached 53 μg m(-3) and 32 μg m(-3) whilst outside concentrations were 101 μg m(-3) and 46 μg m(-3) for PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. The sum of nss-sulphate, nitrate and ammonium, dominate the composition of PM, and contribute the most towards an increase in the PM during the episode days constituting 64% of ambient PM2.5 (52 μg m(-3)) compared to 39% on non-episode days (10 μg m(-3)). Other PM components, such as mineral dust, sea salt or heavy metals were found to be considerably higher during PM episodes but relatively less important. Amongst heavy metals Zn and Pb were found at the highest concentrations in both PM2.5 and PM1. Acid-base ionic balance equations were calculated and point to acidic aerosols during event days and acidic to alkaline aerosols during non-event days. No significant sources of indoor pollutants could be identified inside the old-age home as high correlations were found between outdoor and indoor PM, confirming mainly the outdoor origin of indoor air.},

 abstract = {Elderly people constitute a major portion of world's population. Many of them are physically and mentally vulnerable and need continuous support for their health and well-being. There is a growing trend that these elderly people are placed in an ambient assisted living environment (AAL) with an aim to receive better care and support. In such settings, a lot of attention has been given to continuous health monitoring for maintaining physical health status. However, much less attention has been given toward understanding the entertainment needs of the elderly people, which is an important factor relevant to their mental health and joyful living. This paper thus addresses the entertainment needs of the elderly and proposes a framework of an elderly entertainment support system. The proposed framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people and caregivers) to access various media services in both implicit and explicit manner in order to enhance the quality of their living experience in different contexts. Our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework. We believe that the proposed approach will establish the need to develop entertainment systems and services for the elderly people and allow us to sensibly address the problems associated with their independent, happy and active living.},

 abstract = {Depression is more common in old age than dementia yet is underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is important to recognise that patients may not always present in a typical way, features that may indicate depression include anxiety, a preoccupation with somatic symptoms, and a change in function. The presence of understandable triggers and causes should not deter GPs from offering treatment, as long as symptoms are pervasive and continuously persist beyond two weeks. Age-related disabilities and changes to physical health are major risk factors for depression in older people. Vascular diseases, including stroke, MI and diabetes increase the risk of depression, both through direct effects on the brain and the psychological effects. Likewise, dementia is a risk factor for depression. Psychological factors such as loneliness and loss of a valued role, as well as social factors related to retirement, bereavement and reduced independence may also increase the risk. Patients with a previous history of depression and anxiety disorders are at increased risk of depression in later life. Assessment and diagnosis are largely based on a careful history. This should focus on eliciting current features of depression, which have been present for at least two weeks, and are associated with a significant change in function. It is important to exclude organic disorders including anaemia, B12 and folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism that may mimic symptoms of depressive disorder. Referral to specialist mental health services is indicated in the following cases: diagnostic difficulty, poor response to treatment, psychotic symptoms, significant psychiatric comorbidity or a risk of self-neglect or suicide.},

 abstract = {Ambient air pollution (AAP) and particulate matters (PM) have been closely associated with adverse health effects such as respiratory disease and cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have examined the adverse health effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to AAP and outdoor PM on respiratory disease. However, the effect of PM size (PM2.5 and PM10) on cardiovascular disease has not been well studied. Thus, it remains unclear how the size of the inhalable particles (coarse, fine, or ultrafine) affects mortality and morbidity. Airborne PM concentrations are commonly used for ambient air quality management worldwide, owing to the known effects on cardiorespiratory health. In this article, we assess the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and PM, with a particular focus on PM size. We discuss the association of PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and elemental carbon with mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and altered blood pressure, based on epidemiological studies. In addition, we provide evidence that the adverse health effects of AAP and PM are more pronounced among the elderly, children, and people with preexisting cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Finally, we critically summarize the literature pertaining to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and stroke, and introduce potential studies to better understand the health significance of AAP and PM on cardiovascular disease.},

 abstract = {Due to their detrimental effects on human health, the scientific interest in ultrafine particles (UFP) has been increasing, but available information is far from comprehensive. Compared to the remaining population, the elderly are potentially highly susceptible to the effects of outdoor air pollution. Thus, this study aimed to (1) determine the levels of outdoor pollutants in an urban area with emphasis on UFP concentrations and (2) estimate the respective dose rates of exposure for elderly populations. UFP were continuously measured over 3 weeks at 3 sites in north Portugal: 2 urban (U1 and U2) and 1 rural used as reference (R1). Meteorological parameters and outdoor pollutants including particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were also measured. The dose rates of inhalation exposure to UFP were estimated for three different elderly age categories: 64-70, 71-80, and >81 years. Over the sampling period levels of PM10, O3 and NO2 were in compliance with European legislation. Mean UFP were 1.7 × 10(4) and 1.2 × 10(4) particles/cm(3) at U1 and U2, respectively, whereas at rural site levels were 20-70% lower (mean of 1 ×10(4) particles/cm(3)). Vehicular traffic and local emissions were the predominant identified sources of UFP at urban sites. In addition, results of correlation analysis showed that UFP were meteorologically dependent. Exposure dose rates were 1.2- to 1.4-fold higher at urban than reference sites with the highest levels noted for adults at 71-80 yr, attributed mainly to higher inhalation rates.},

Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

A total of 109 patients with M. morganii bacteremia at a medical center in Taiwan from 2003 to 2012 were studied. Among them, 30.3 % had polymicrobial bacteremia and 75.2 % had community-acquired infection. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (62.4 %) and diabetes mellitus (38.5 %). The urinary tract (41.3 %) was the major portal of entry, followed by the hepatobiliary tract (27.5 %), skin and soft tissue (21.1 %), and primary bacteremia (10.1 %). Susceptibility testing of M. morganii isolates showed ubiquitous resistance to first-generation cephalosporins and ampicillin-clavulanate; resistance rates to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin were 30.3 %, 1.8 %, and 10.1 %, respectively. Overall, the 14-day mortality was 14.7 %. Univariate analysis revealed that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values [p = 0.0137, odds ratio (OR) 5.26], intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p = 0.011, OR 4.4), and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (p < 0.001, OR 1.62) were significantly associated with mortality. The APACHE II score remained the only significant risk factor for mortality in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0012, OR 1.55). In conclusion, M. morganii bacteremia patients were mostly elderly, with one or more comorbidities. Most of the patients had community-acquired infection via the urinary and hepatobiliary tracts. Furthermore, prognosis can be predicted according to disease severity measured by the APACHE II score.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop a basis for the hypothesis that digital action games may produce cognitive benefits for older adults. First, a discussion of the relationship between cognitive and physical health shows the increasing weight given to the role of declines in cognition in the development of dependency in older adult population studies. Second, evidence that cognitive training produces 'far transfer' in elders is presented. The key issue is that one approach, known as extended practice training, has been successful in producing far transfer to memory and other processes. Its principles, which are consistent with those associated with positive brain plasticity effects, are identified. Those principles are then related to the mechanics of digital action games, which also have the important added feature of producing the experiences of presence, engagement, and flow, the subjective elements of game play that are likely to sustain interest and emotional investment in the skills practiced so that the play produces cognitive benefits. The specific cognitive abilities proposed to be improved by different types of game genres are outlined, and recent developments in game and interface design that may affect the willingness of older adults to play are described.},

 abstract = {Many societies across the world are confronted with demographic changes, usually related to increased life expectancy and, often, relatively low birth rates. Information and communication technologies (ICT) may contribute to adequately support senior citizens in aging societies with respect to quality of life and quality and efficiency of health care processes. For investigating and for providing answers on whether new information and communication technologies can contribute to keeping, or even improving quality of life, health and self-sufficiency in ageing societies through new ways of living and new forms of care, the Lower Saxony Research Network Design of Environments for Ageing (GAL) had been established as a five years research project, running from 2008 to 2013. Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies in personal and home environments were especially important. In this article we report on the GAL project, and present some of its major outcomes after five years of research. We report on major challenges and lessons learned in running and organizing such a large, inter- and multidisciplinary project and discuss GAL in the context of related research projects. With respect to research outcomes, we have, for example, learned new knowledge about multimodal and speech-based human-machine-interaction mechanisms for persons with functional restrictions, and identified new methods and developed new algorithms for identifying activities of daily life and detecting acute events, particularly falls. A total of 79 apartments of senior citizens had been equipped with specific "GAL technology", providing new insights into the use of sensor data for smart homes. Major challenges we had to face were to deal constructively with GAL's highly inter- and multidisciplinary aspects, with respect to research into GAL's application scenarios, shifting from theory and lab experimentation to field tests, and the complexity of organizing and, in our view, successfully managing such a large project. Overall it can be stated that, from our point of view, the GAL research network has been run successfully and has achieved its major research objectives. Since we now know much more on how and where to use AAL technologies for new environments of living and new forms of care, a future focus for research can now be outlined for systematically planned studies, scientifically exploring the benefits of AAL technologies for senior citizens, in particular with respect to quality of life and the quality and efficiency of health care.},

 abstract = {Automatic recognition of human activity is useful as a means of estimating energy expenditure and has potential for use in fall detection and prediction. The emergence of the smartphone as a ubiquitous device presents an opportunity to utilize its embedded sensors, computational power and data connectivity as a platform for continuous health monitoring. In the study described herein, 37 older people (83.9  ±  3.4 years) performed a series of activities of daily living (ADLs) while a smartphone (containing a triaxial accelerometer, triaxial gyroscope and barometric pressure sensor) was placed in the front pocket of their trousers. These results are compared to a similar trial conducted previously in which 20 young people (21.9  ±  1.65 years) were asked to perform the same ADLs using the same smartphone (again in the front pocket of their trousers).In each trial, the participants were asked to perform several activities (standing, sitting, lying, walking on level ground, up and down staircases, and riding an elevator up and down) in a free-living environment. During each acquisition session, the internal sensor signals were recorded and subsequently used to develop activity classifiers based on a decision tree algorithm that classified ADL in epochs of ~1.25 s. When training and testing with the younger cohort, using a leave-one-out cross validation procedure, a total classification sensitivity of 80.9% ± 9.57% ([Formula: see text] = 0.75  ±  0.12) was obtained. Retraining and testing on the older cohort, again using cross validation, gives a comparable total class sensitivity of 82.0% ± 8.88% ([Formula: see text] =0.74  ±  0.12).When trained with the younger group and tested on the older group, a total class sensitivity of 69.2% ± 24.8% (95% confidence interval [69.6%, 70.6%]) and [Formula: see text] = 0.60  ±  0.27 (95% confidence interval [0.58, 0.59]) was obtained. When trained on the older group and tested on the younger group, a total class sensitivity of 80.5% ± 6.80% (95% confidence interval [79.0%, 80.6%]) and [Formula: see text] = 0.74  ±  0.08 (95% confidence interval [0.73, 0.75]) was obtained.An instance of the decision tree classifier developed was implemented on the smartphone as a software application. It was capable of performing real-time activity classification for a period of 17 h on a single battery charge, illustrating that smartphone technology provides a viable platform on which to perform long-term activity monitoring.},

 abstract = {It is widely taken for granted that the interest in technology decreases with increasing age. Many studies and especially large scale surveys seem to confirm declining technology acceptance; however, it is argued that composition effects (e.g. increasing proportions of women among the older age groups), cohort effects (e.g. experience with different technologies during the lifetime) and various living and health conditions (e.g. living alone, having children in the neighborhood and experience of falls) have to be taken into account and that these factors will have different impacts on the acceptance of different scenarios of assistive technologies. The analyses are based on data from a self-administered questionnaire (n = 2032, a representative random sample of individuals aged 50 years and above in Lower Saxony, Germany). The survey briefly introduced four scenarios of ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies. Multinominal logistic regression was used to explore the correlations of acceptance and the independent variables mentioned. The results show that the simple assumption of an age effect, i.e. technology acceptance generally declines with increasing age, is misleading. An answer to the question whether older people will make use of assistive technologies in the future should consider specific scenarios and also various socioeconomic variables.},

High ambient temperatures decrease blood pressure (BP) in young and middle aged adults and may lead to orthostatic hypotension, increasing the risk of falls in older adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a test protocol to investigate BP response and aerobic capacity of older adults in a hot indoor environment. BP response and aerobic capacity were assessed in 26 community-dwelling older women (median age 75.5 years) at a room temperature of either 20 °C or 30 °C. The protocol was well tolerated by all participants. In the 30 °C condition systolic and diastolic BP (median difference 10 and 8 mmHg, respectively) and distance walked in 6 min (median difference 29.3 m) were lower than in the 20 °C condition (all p < 0.01). Systolic BP decreased after standing up from a lying position in the 30 °C (17.4 mmHg) and 20 °C (14.2 mmHg) condition (both p < 0.001). In conclusion, the protocol is feasible in this cohort and should be repeated in older adults with poor physical performance and impaired cardio-vascular response mechanisms. Furthermore, aerobic capacity was reduced after exposure to hot environmental temperatures, which should be considered when recommending exercise to older people during the summer months.},

The majority of the studies examined the effect of immersive technologies on elder peoples' age-related declines, including sensory and motor changes (vision, hearing, motor skills), cognitive changes and social changes. Various immersive technologies have been described and tested to address these age-related changes, and have been categorized as 'games and simulations', 'robotics' and 'social technologies'. In most cases, promising results were found for immersive technologies to challenge age-related declines, especially through the increase of morale.},

Most of the elderly people in these facilities are suffering from different chronic diseases such as dementia. Existing technologies are mainly focusing on non-medication interventions and monitoring of ADL for addressing loss of autonomy or well-being. Monitoring and managing ADL related to cognitive behaviors for non-medication intervention are very effective in improving dementia patients' conditions. However, cognitive functions of patients can be improved if appropriate recommendations of medications are delivered at a particular time. Previously we developed the Secured Wireless Sensor Network Integrated Cloud Computing for Ubiquitous-Life Care (SC(3)). SC(3) services were limited to monitoring ADL of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease and providing non-medication recommendations to the patient. In this article, we propose a system called the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an integral part of the SC(3) platform. Using the Smart CDSS, patients are provided with access to medication recommendations of expert physicians. Physicians are provided with an interface to create clinical knowledge for medication recommendations and to observe the patient's condition. The clinical knowledge created by physicians as the knowledge base of the Smart CDSS produces recommendations to the caregiver for medications based on each patient's symptoms.},

One main theme: Going around in a circle and two themes: being alone without meaning in life and struggling to achieve reconciliation emerged from the analysis. An important implication for mental healthcare practice is the need to develop a person's ability to shape and take control of her/his life. The healthcare organisation must be committed to a plan that sets out strategies enabling suicidal individuals to avoid the negative experience of meaninglessness. It was concluded that suicidal depressed elderly persons need help to escape from their desperate situation. More research is urgently required in order to prevent suicide in depressed elderly persons whose emotional pain is unbearable.},

 abstract = {With fewer newborns and people living longer, older people are making up an increasing fraction of the total population. Epidemiological evidence shows that older-age-related health problems affect a wide and expanding proportion of the world population. One of the major epidemiological trends of this century is the rise of chronic diseases that affect more elderly than younger people. A total of 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 are attributable to outdoor air pollution; the susceptibility to adverse effects of air pollution is expected to differ widely between people and within the same person, and also over time. Frailty history, a measure of multi-system decline, modifies cumulative associations between air pollution and lung function. Moreover, pre-existing diseases may determine susceptibility. In the elderly, due to comorbidity, exposure to air pollutants may even be fatal. Rapid and not-well-planned urbanization is associated with high level of ambient air pollution, mainly caused by vehicular exhausts. In general, there is sufficient evidence of the adverse effects related to short-term exposure, while fewer studies have addressed the longer-term health effects. Increased pollution exposures have been associated with increased mortality, hospital admissions/emergency-room visits, mainly due to exacerbations of chronic diseases or to respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia). These effects may also be modulated by ambient temperature and many studies show that the elderly are mostly vulnerable to heat waves. The association between heat and mortality in the elderly is well-documented, while less is known regarding the associations with hospital admissions. Chronic exposure to elevated levels of air pollution has been related to the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma, and emphysema. There is also growing evidence suggesting adverse effects on lung function related to long-term exposure to ambient air pollution. Few studies have assessed long-term mortality in the elderly. It is still unclear what are the pollutants most damaging to the health of the elderly. It seems that elderly subjects are more vulnerable to particulate matter (PM) than to other pollutants, with particular effect on daily cardio-respiratory mortality and acute hospital admissions. Not many studies have targeted elderly people specifically, as well as specific respiratory morbidity. Most data have shown higher risks in the elderly compared to the rest of the population. Future epidemiological cohort studies need to keep investigating the health effects of air pollutants (mainly cardiopulmonary diseases) on the elderly.},

 abstract = {In many areas of the world, concentrations of ambient air pollutants exceed levels associated with increased risk of acute and chronic health problems. While effective policies to reduce emissions at their sources are clearly preferable, some evidence supports the effectiveness of individual actions to reduce exposure and health risks. Personal exposure to ambient air pollution can be reduced on high air pollution days by staying indoors, reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air with air filters, and limiting physical exertion, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources. Limited evidence suggests that the use of respirators may be effective in some circumstances. Awareness of air pollution levels is facilitated by a growing number of public air quality alert systems. Avoiding exposure to air pollutants is especially important for susceptible individuals with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, children, and the elderly. Research on mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects of air pollution have suggested potential pharmaceutical or chemopreventive interventions, such as antioxidant or antithrombotic agents, but in the absence of data on health outcomes, no sound recommendations can be made for primary prevention. Health care providers and their patients should carefully consider individual circumstances related to outdoor and indoor air pollutant exposure levels and susceptibility to those air pollutants when deciding on a course of action to reduce personal exposure and health risks from ambient air pollutants. Careful consideration is especially warranted when interventions may have unintended negative consequences, such as when efforts to avoid exposure to air pollutants lead to reduced physical activity or when there is evidence that dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, have potential adverse health effects. These potential complications of partially effective personal interventions to reduce exposure or risk highlight the primary importance of reducing emissions of air pollutants at their sources.},

 abstract = {Ethylene (ET) is ubiquitous in the environment and is produced both naturally and due to anthropogenic sources. Interestingly, the majority of ambient ET contribution is from natural sources and anthropogenic sources contribute only a minor portion. While microbes and plants naturally produce a large amount of ET, mammals are reported to produce only a small amount of ET endogenously. Anthropogenic sources of ET include the combustion of gas, fuel, coal and biomass. ET is also widely used as an intermediate to make other chemicals and products and is also used for controlled ripening of fruits and vegetables. Although, a review of human and laboratory animal studies indicate ET to be relatively non-toxic, there is concern about the potential toxicity of ET because ET is metabolically converted to ethylene oxide (EtO). EtO has been classified to be carcinogenic to human by the inhalation route by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cancer. ET, however, has been classified as a Group 3 chemical which indicates it is not classified as a human carcinogen by IARC. Several studies have reported ET to cause adverse effects to plant species (vegetation effects) at concentrations that are not adverse to humans. Therefore, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conducted detailed health and welfare (odor and vegetation) based assessments of ET to develop both health and vegetative based toxicity factors in 2008 in accordance with TCEQ guidelines. The health assessment based on well-conducted animal toxicity studies resulted in identification of higher points of departures and subsequently higher effect screening levels (ESLs) that were more than a magnitude higher than the threshold adverse effect level for vegetative effects for ET. Further, based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic mode-of-actions for ET it appears the metabolic conversion of ET to EtO is of insufficient magnitude to cause concern of potential cancer risk. Therefore, the short-term ESL for air permit reviews and air monitoring evaluations is the vegetation-based ESL of 1200 ppb as it is more than a magnitude lower than the health-based acute ESL of 150,000 ppb. Similar to the acute derivation, the chronic evaluation resulted in the derivation of a chronic vegetation based ESL of 30 ppb that was much lower than the chronic ESL of 1600 ppb. In summary, the TCEQ's acute and chronic ESLs for vegetation will protect the general public from short-term and long-term adverse health and welfare effects. The general public includes children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health conditions.},

The Beirut Air Pollution and Health Effects study aimed to determine the relationship between short-term variations in ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and emergency hospital admissions in the city of Beirut, and whether susceptible groups are more greatly affected. An autoregressive Poisson model was used to evaluate the association between daily concentrations of particulate matter and respiratory and cardiovascular emergency hospital admissions after controlling for confounders. All variables were measured during 1 year from January 2012 to December 2012. Relative risks of admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases were calculated for an increase in 10 μg.m(-3) of pollutant concentrations. Total respiratory admissions were significantly associated with the levels of PM10 (1.012 [95% CI 1.004-1.02]) per 10 μg.m(-3) rise in daily mean pollutant concentration for PM10 and 1.016 [95% CI 1.000-1.032] for PM2.5 on the same day. With regard to susceptible groups, total respiratory admissions were associated with PM2.5 and PM10 within the same day in children (relative risk (RR), 1.013 and 1.014; 95% confidence interval, 0.985-1.042 and 1.000-1.029 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively). Moreover, a nearly significant association was found between particles and total circulatory admissions for adults and elderly groups in the same day. These results are similar to other international studies. Therefore, air pollution control is expected to reduce the number of admissions of these diseases in Lebanon.},

 abstract = {Falls are a major public health problem for older people. Recent research suggests that fear of falling may be a more pervasive and serious problem than falls among the elderly. The present study was conducted to determine whether frail elderly persons with fear of falling have lower physical function. A total of 47 subjects (aged 73 to 95) were recruited from a geriatric health services facility in Osaka. Physical function including balance, mobility, and muscular strength were measured using the following tests: Timed up & go test (TUG), functional reach test, single limb stance with eyes open, ten-meter walk, and knee extensor strength. Twenty-nine subjects (62%) had fear of falling and 18 (38%) had no fear of falling. There was no significant difference in age, sex, or the proportion using assistive devices. Results from the statistical tests showed that there were no differences in physical function, except in the functional reach test. The ratio of TUG to 10 m walk was used to determine the association between balance and mobility. In frail elderly persons with fear of falling and in those without fear of falling, the means of the ratios were 1.20 (SD=0.27) and 1.03 (SD=0.16), respectively. The ratios for frail elderly persons with fear of falling were higher (p=0.024) than the frail elderly without fear of falling. Our study suggests that even if frail elderly individuals walk slowly, they are not afraid of falling if there is a feasible balance function. We conclude that, in low-functioning frail elderly, fear of falling is associated with a combination of balance function and gait speed.},

Alterations in sleep architecture that occur as a part of normal aging will contribute to sleep problems as we grow older. Other contributing factors-including comorbid medical conditions, changes in lifestyle and schedule, altered circadian rhythm, among a host of others-can have detrimental effects on the health of the elderly. Coupled with a number of sleep disorders that either emerge or exacerbate with age, the effects of poor sleep often result in an overall worsening of quality of life. Treatment options can be unique in this population and often more difficult due to the effects of normal aging, as well as polypharmacy and possible medication interactions. The following article will focus on the common sleep disorders that can besiege this population, symptoms to aid in diagnosis, and specific treatment options to help improve quality of life in the elderly.},

 abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogen transmitted through food that can cause severe infections in high-risk groups such as pregnant women, elderly, young children and immunocompromised individuals. It is a ubiquitous bacterium that can survive in harsh conditions, such as dry environments, at low temperatures, in brine conditions and at low pH values. It also has the capacity to form biofilms, which makes it particularly successful even in colonizing surfaces within food processing plants. This study analyzed the presence of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat food (RTE) such as sausage, cheese, fresh salads, and other types of raw food. 850 samples of refrigerated and packaged food collected in 2008 and 2009 were analyzed. It was found that 25% of these samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes strains. Serotyping and virulence genes detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified that strains belonging to serotype 4b, and containing one or more genes encoded by pathogenicity island (LIPI-1), were significantly associated with specific food types. Furthermore, using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), it was possible to associate isolates from cheese with strains from clinical cases of listeriosis outbreaks that occurred during the same time period within the same geographic regions. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between isolates from frozen seafood and from clinical strains obtained from sporadic cases of listeriosis. In agreement with reports described in other countries, our results shown that Chilean strains of L. monocytogenes from food products include the most virulent serotypes, encoding for the main virulence genes of the LIPI-1, and were clonally related to clinical isolates from sporadic cases and outbreaks of listeriosis. In conclusion, we show that Chilean isolates of L. monocytogenes from RTE and raw food products can cause disease in humans, representing a public health risk that justifies permanent surveillance.},

 abstract = {Human activity detection within smart homes is one of the basis of unobtrusive wellness monitoring of a rapidly aging population in developed countries. Most works in this area use the concept of "activity" as the building block with which to construct applications such as healthcare monitoring or ambient assisted living. The process of identifying a specific activity encompasses the selection of the appropriate set of sensors, the correct preprocessing of their provided raw data and the learning/reasoning using this information. If the selection of the sensors and the data processing methods are wrongly performed, the whole activity detection process may fail, leading to the consequent failure of the whole application. Related to this, the main contributions of this review are the following: first, we propose a classification of the main activities considered in smart home scenarios which are targeted to older people's independent living, as well as their characterization and formalized context representation; second, we perform a classification of sensors and data processing methods that are suitable for the detection of the aforementioned activities. Our aim is to help researchers and developers in these lower-level technical aspects that are nevertheless fundamental for the success of the complete application.},

 abstract = {Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The "health state" of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.},

 abstract = {Short-term associations between both hot and cold ambient temperatures and higher mortality have been found worldwide. Few studies have examined these associations on longer time scales. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated for 1976-2012 for Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China, defining "annual" time periods in 2 ways: from May through April of the following year and from November through October. Annual frequency and severity of extreme temperatures were summarized by using a degree-days approach with extreme heat expressed as annual degree-days >29.3°C and cold as annual degree-days <27.5°C. For example, a day with a mean temperature of 25.0°C contributes 2.5 cold degree-days to the annual total. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the association between annual hot and cold degree-days and the ASMR, with adjustment for long-term trends. Increases of 10 hot or 200 cold degree-days in an annual period, the approximate interquartile ranges for these variables, were significantly (all P's ≤ 0.011) associated with 1.9% or 3.1% increases, respectively, in the annual ASMR for the May-April analyses and with 2.2% or 2.8% increases, respectively, in the November-October analyses. Associations were stronger for noncancer and elderly mortality. Mortality increases associated with extreme temperature are not simply due to short-term forward displacement of deaths that would have occurred anyway within a few weeks.},

This population is particularly susceptible to multiple morbidities that can be exacerbated by confounding factors like age-related safety risks, polypharmacy, poor nutrition, and social isolation. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to health conditions (heart disease, stroke, and diabetes) that put them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. When an older adult presents to the emergency department with 1 or more of these life-altering diagnoses, an admission to the intensive care unit is often inevitable. Pain is one of the most pervasive manifestations exhibited by intensive care unit patients. There are myriad challenges for critical care nurses in caring for patients experiencing pain-inadequate communication (cognitively impaired or intubated patients), addressing the concerns of family members, or gaps in patients' knowledge. The purpose of this article was to discuss the multidimensional nature of pain and identify concepts innate to pain homeostenosis for elderly patients in the critical care setting. Evidence-based strategies, including an interprofessional team approach and best practice recommendations regarding pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management, are presented.},

The monitoring is based on the recording of environmental parameters like temperature and light intensity as well as micro-level incidents which allows one to infer daily activities like moving, sitting, sleeping, usage of electrical appliances and plumbing components. The prototype is built upon inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware (e.g., various sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, ZigBee-compatible wireless communication modules) and license-free software, thereby ensuring low system deployment costs. The network comprises nodes placed in a house's main rooms or mounted on furniture, one wearable node, one actuator node and a centralized processing element (coordinator). Upon detecting significant deviations from the ordinary activity patterns of individuals and/or sudden falls, the system issues automated alarms which may be forwarded to authorized caregivers via a variety of communication channels. Furthermore, measured environmental parameters and activity incidents may be monitored through standard web interfaces.},

Human rights and environmental norms are powerful tools to combat air pollution and its impact on health. The dependence of human rights on environmental quality has been recognised in international texts and by human rights treaty bodies. The growing awareness of the environment has already yielded considerable legislative and regulatory output. However, the implementation of standards remains a pervasive problem.

This review presents an overview of how videogame technologies can be used to address health issues contributing to reduced independence in older adults. Four themes were identified: (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) health issues addressed using videogames, and (4) clinicians' perspectives. Several recommendations have been proposed to build upon the use and integration of videogame technology into rehabilitation and training for older adults. In particular, the use of videogames for health requires an appropriate game classification system for development of games that are appropriate for the physical, cognitive, and social requirements of older adults or those living with a disability.},

@article{pmid26197060,
 abstract = {Multi-pollutant air pollution (i.e., several pollutants reaching very high concentrations simultaneously) frequently occurs in many regions across China. Air quality index (AQI) is used worldwide to inform the public about levels of air pollution and associated health risks. The current AQI approach used in China is based on the maximum value of individual pollutants, and does not consider the combined health effects of exposure to multiple pollutants. In this study, two novel alternative indices--aggregate air quality index (AAQI) and health-risk based air quality index (HAQI)--were calculated based on data collected in six megacities of China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shjiazhuang, Xi'an, and Wuhan) during 2013 to 2014. Both AAQI and HAQI take into account the combined health effects of various pollutants, and the HAQI considers the exposure (or concentration)-response relationships of pollutants. AAQI and HAQI were compared to AQI to examine the effectiveness of the current AQI in characterizing multi-pollutant air pollution in China. The AAQI and HAQI values are higher than the AQI on days when two or more pollutants simultaneously exceed the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 24-hour Grade II standards. The results of the comparison of the classification of risk categories based on the three indices indicate that the current AQI approach underestimates the severity of health risk associated with exposure to multi-pollutant air pollution. For the AQI-based risk category of 'unhealthy', 96% and 80% of the days would be 'very unhealthy' or 'hazardous' if based on AAQI and HAQI, respectively; and for the AQI-based risk category of 'very unhealthy', 67% and 75% of the days would be 'hazardous' if based on AAQI and HAQI, respectively. The results suggest that the general public, especially sensitive population groups such as children and the elderly, should take more stringent actions than those currently suggested based on the AQI approach during high air pollution events. Sensitivity studies were conducted to examine the assumptions used in the AAQI and HAQI approaches. Results show that AAQI is sensitive to the choice of pollutant irrelevant constant. HAQI is sensitive to the choice of both threshold values and pollutants included in total risk calculation.},

 abstract = {Air pollution is a widespread environmental concern. Considerable epidemiological evidence indicates air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM), as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the developed countries. The main objective of our review is to assess the levels and sources of PM across the Middle East area and to search evidence for the relationship between PM exposure and CVD. An extensive review of the published literature pertaining to the subject (2000-2013) was conducted using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar databases. We reveal that low utilization of public transport, ageing vehicle fleet and the increasing number of personal cars in the developing countries all contribute to the traffic congestion and aggravate the pollution problem. The annual average values of PM pollutants in the Middle East region are much higher than the World Health Organization 2006 guidelines (PM2.5 = 10 μg/m(3), PM10 = 20 μg/m(3)). We uncover evidence on the association between PM and CVD in 4 Middle East countries: Iran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The findings are in light of the international figures. Ambient PM pollution is considered a potential risk factor for platelet activation and atherosclerosis and has been found to be linked with an increased risk for mortality and hospital admissions due to CVD. This review highlights the importance of developing a strategy to improve air quality and reduce outdoor air pollution in the developing countries, particularly in the Middle East. Future studies should weigh the potential impact of PM on the overall burden of cardiac diseases.},

However, the National Academies of Science concluded that a multipollutant regulatory approach that takes into account the joint effects of multiple constituents is likely to be more protective of human health. Unfortunately, the large majority of existing research had focused on health effects of air pollution for one pollutant or for one pollutant with control for the independent effects of a small number of copollutants. Limitations in existing statistical methods are at least partially responsible for this lack of information on joint effects. The goal of this project was to fill this gap by developing flexible statistical methods to estimate the joint effects of multiple pollutants, while allowing for potential nonlinear or nonadditive associations between a given pollutant and the health outcome of interest.},

 abstract = {Creating android and humanoid robots to furnish companionship in the nursing care of older people continues to attract substantial development capital and research. Some people object, though, that machines of this kind furnish human-robot interaction characterized by inauthentic relationships. In particular, robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been charged with substituting mindless mimicry of human behaviour for the real presence of conscious caring offered by human nurses. When thus viewed as deceptive, the robots also have prompted corresponding concerns regarding their potential psychological, moral, and spiritual implications for people who will be interacting socially with these machines. The foregoing objections and concerns can be assessed quite differently, depending upon ambient religious beliefs or metaphysical presuppositions. The complaints may be set aside as unnecessary, for example, within religious traditions for which even current robots can be viewed as presenting spiritual aspects. Elsewhere, technological cultures may reject the complaints as expression of outdated superstition, holding that the machines eventually will enjoy a consciousness described entirely in materialist and behaviourist terms. While recognizing such assessments, the authors of this essay propose that the heart of the foregoing objections and concerns may be evaluated, in part, scientifically - albeit with a conclusion recommending fundamental revisions in AI modelling of human mental life. Specifically, considerations now favour introduction of AI models using interactive classical and quantum computation. Without this change, the answer to the essay's title question arguably is 'no' - with it, the answer plausibly becomes 'maybe'. Either outcome holds very interesting implications for nurses.},

The findings supported the importance of social presence and perceived behavioral control in older adults' exercise prediction, and highlighted the effect of collaborative play in older adults' exercise promotion. Compared with traditional exercise, the effect of exergames on motivating older adults to exercise was significantly lower. The findings of this study revealed rich directions for future elderly exercise research, and provided strategies that could be applicable for policy making and game design to promote elderly exercise participation.},

 abstract = {The rapid growth in the number of older adults has many implications for public health, including the need to better understand the risks posed by environmental exposures. Aging leads to a decline and deterioration of functional properties at the cellular, tissue and organ level. This loss of functional properties yields to a loss of homeostasis and decreased adaptability to internal and external stress. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, weight loss, and low activity that is associated with adverse health outcomes. Frailty manifests as an age-related, biological vulnerability to stressors and decreased physiological reserves. Ambient air pollution exposure affects human health, and elderly people appear to be particularly susceptible to its adverse effects. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of air pollution in the modulation of several biological mechanisms involved in aging. Evidence is presented on how air pollution can modify the bidirectional association between successful and pathological aging throughout the frailty conditions.},

However, pervasive age stereotypes still exist that limit the agency and self-perception of older people, and part of the experience of new aging is to actively combat such negative stereotypes. The purpose of this study is to explore how lifelong learning and a degree attainment in midlife become embedded into new aging practices. The study will focus on a specific group of aging workers who attained a Master's degree from Finnish universities in their fifties. In order to better understand the aging experiences of these older graduates, this study seeks to address how they construct the meaning of aging in relation to their own educational and professional status. The data consist of 14 life-history interviews, which were analyzed as narrative identity performances. Differentiating oneself from the stereotype of physical and mental decline and positioning oneself in a favorable way in inter-generational relations were common ways of approaching aging. Age-negotiation and ambivalence about aging were expressed by structuring narratives around clear oppositions and contradictions. University studies at age 50+ became a talking point in countering cultural age-stereotypes, because it showed that aging workers could still accomplish significant goals and "renew" oneself intellectually. University studies also enabled collaboration with the younger generation and the breaking of narrow age boundaries.},

 abstract = {Few multi-city studies have been conducted to investigate the acute health effects of low and high temperatures on diabetes mortality worldwide. We aimed to examine effects of ambient temperatures on city-/gender-/age-/education-specific diabetes mortality in nine Chinese cities using a two-stage analysis. Distributed lag non-linear model was first applied to estimate the city-specific non-linear and delayed effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality. Pooled effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality were then obtained using meta-analysis, based on restricted maximum likelihood. We found that heat effects were generally acute and followed by a period of mortality displacement, while cold effects could last for over two weeks. The pooled relative risks of extreme high (99th percentile of temperature) and high temperature (90th percentile of temperature) were 1.29 (95%CI: 1.11-1.47) and 1.11 (1.03-1.19) over lag 0-21 days, compared with the 75th percentile of temperature. In contrast, the pooled relative risks over lag 0-21 days were 1.44 (1.25-1.66) for extreme low (1st percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (1.12-1.30) for low temperature (10th percentile of temperature), compared to 25th percentile of temperature. The estimate of heat effects was relatively higher among females than that among males, with opposite trend for cold effects, and the estimates of heat and cold effects were particularly higher among the elderly and those with low education, although the differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). These findings have important public health implications for protecting diabetes patients from adverse ambient temperatures.},

 abstract = {We have demonstrated previously that an individualized health management system using advanced medical information technology, named ubiquitous (u)-healthcare, was helpful in achieving better glycemic control than routine care. Recently, we generated a new u-healthcare system using a voice inception technique for elderly diabetic patients to communicate information about their glucose control, physical activity, and diet more easily. In a randomized clinical trial, 70 diabetic patients aged 60-85 years were assigned randomly to a standard care group or u-healthcare group for 6 months. The primary end points were the changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glucose fluctuation assessed by the mean amplitude glycemic excursion (MAGE). Changes in body weight, lifestyle, and knowledge about diabetes were also investigated. After 6 months, the HbA1c levels decreased significantly in the u-healthcare group (from 8.6 ± 1.0% to 7.5 ± 0.6%) compared with the standard care group (from 8.7 ± 0.9% to 8.2 ± 1.1%, P < 0.01). The MAGE decreased more in the u-healthcare group than in the standard care group. Systolic blood pressure and body weight decreased and liver functions improved in the u-healthcare group, but not in the standard care group. The u-healthcare system with voice inception technique was effective in achieving glycemic control without hypoglycemia in elderly diabetic patients (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01891474).},

 abstract = {In developed countries, public health systems are under pressure due to the increasing percentage of population over 65. In this context, homecare based on ambient intelligence technology seems to be a suitable solution to allow elderly people to continue to enjoy the comforts of home and help optimize medical resources. Thus, current technological developments make it possible to build complex homecare applications that demand, among others, flexibility mechanisms for being able to evolve as context does (adaptability), as well as avoiding service disruptions in the case of node failure (availability). The solution proposed in this paper copes with these flexibility requirements through the whole life-cycle of the target applications: from design phase to runtime. The proposed domain modeling approach allows medical staff to design customized applications, taking into account the adaptability needs. It also guides software developers during system implementation. The application execution is managed by a multi-agent based middleware, making it possible to meet adaptation requirements, assuring at the same time the availability of the system even for stateful applications.},

 abstract = {Senior farmers suffer the highest fatality risk of any age group in agriculture. The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop a "voice" for senior farmers by examining aging farmers' and their families' perspectives of farm work, associated injury risks, and methods to decrease those risks. Focus groups and personal interviews were used to collect data from 81 participants across seven U.S. states. The findings reflect the collective and verified voice of the study group. The Health Belief Model was applied and revealed differences between farmers and their family members; however, the need and desire to continue self-directed work was ubiquitous. Seniors reported external risks, while family members were more likely to name risks associated with the health of the senior farmer. Both groups cited stress as an injury risk. Posing risk to others was the trigger point for senior farmers to make behavior changes. Family members reported uneasiness in initiating safety conversations. Adaptation of existing interventions for self-assessment of risk was rejected. Use of the popular farm press and respected local resources were desired as avenues for safety education. Humor and stories were highly regarded. Interventions should be tailored for the target audience. These new insights into the risk perceptions of senior farmers and their families may result in more appropriate actions by health professionals, extension staff social workers, vocational rehabilitation specialists, and others who work with farm populations.},

 abstract = {Falls are a major health risk that diminish the quality of life among elderly people. Apart from falls themselves, most dramatic consequences are usually related with long lying periods that can cause serious side effects. These findings call for pervasive long-term fall detection systems able to automatically detect falls. In this paper, we propose an effective fall detection algorithm for mobile platforms. Using data retrieved from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs) and/or SmartPhones (SPs), our algorithm is able to detect falls using features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope. While mostly of the mobile-based solutions for fall management deal only with accelerometer data, in the proposed approach we combine the instantaneous acceleration magnitude vector with changes of the user's heading in a Threshold Based Algorithm (TBA). In such a way, we were able to handle falls detection with minimal computational load, increasing the overall system accuracy with respect to traditional fall management methods. Experimental results show the strong detection performance of the proposed solution in discriminating between falls and typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) presenting fall-like acceleration patterns.},

However, conventional physical checks are discrete and transient, which is incapable for the health monitor of daily living. Dedicated to everyday physiological monitor, we have developed a multi-parameter smart armband which is able record pulse, temperature and triaxial accelerations continuously. With the wearable device and signal processing algorithm, experiments of data acquisition in the daily living have been implemented on the volunteers. The long period record of 38 hours has demonstrated its feasibility of a total record without disturbing. And both historical and cross comparisons on the parameter correlation analysis have proven the valuable health information that the armband could reveal. As an integrated sensor module, the smart armband is simple and non-obtrusive, thus opens a promising approach towards the pervasive health monitor, especially for the elder population.},

 abstract = {Ageing is a major global demographic trend, which seems to be intensified. The earlier detection of risks associated with ageing, can enable earlier intervention to ameliorate their negative consequences. Many of these recent efforts are associated with the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the stemming from them innovations in the fight against this age related decline and frailty. Ubiquitous unobtrusive monitoring and training (recently much blended by means of exergames) has become reality due to the availability of new mobile sensors and devices and the emergence of new technologies and services. The current piece of work presents the different milestones we have achieved as best practices during the past seven years of piloting training and exergaming ICT components in an effort to support Active and Healthy Aging. Our impact verification and results validation methodologies are revisited here in an effort to outline best practices and build up neuroscientific evidence.

 abstract = {Research on the association between ambient temperature and cerebrovascular morbidity is scarce in China. In this study, we applied mixed generalized additive model (MGAM) to daily counts of cerebrovascular disease of Shanghai residents aged 65 years or older from 2007-2011, stratified by gender. Weighted daily mean temperature up to lags of one week was smoothed by natural cubic spline, and was added into the model to assess both linear and nonlinear effects of temperature. We found that when the mean temperature increased by 1 °C, the male cases of cerebrovascular disease reduced by 0.95% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.80%, 1.10%) or reduced by 0.34% (95% CI: -0.68, 1.36%) in conditions of temperature was below or above 27 °C. However, for every 1 °C increase in temperature, the female cases of cerebrovascular disease increased by 0.34% (95% CI: -0.26%, 0.94%) or decreased by 0.92% (95% CI: 0.72, 1.11%) in conditions of temperature was below or above 8 °C, respectively. Temperature and cerebrovascular morbidity is negatively associated in Shanghai. MGAM is recommended in assessing the association between environmental hazards and health outcomes in time series studies.},

Our study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of air pollutants including PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the largest city in Vietnam. Data on hospitalization from the two largest hospitals in HCMC and daily records of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and meteorological data were collected from February 2004 to December 2007. A time-series regression analysis with distributed lag model was applied for data analysis. Changes in levels of NO2 and PM10 were strongly associated with hospital admissions for both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVD); whereas levels of SO2 were only moderately associated with respiratory and CVD hospital admissions and O3 concentration was not associated with any of them. For a 10μg/m(3) increase of each air pollutant, the risk of respiratory admissions increased from 0.7% to 8% while the risk of CVD admissions increased from 0.5% to 4%. Females were found to be more sensitive than males to exposure to air pollutants in regard to respiratory diseases. In regard to CVD, females (RR, 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had a slightly higher risk of admissions than males (RR, 1.03, 95% CI, 1-1.06) to exposure to NO2. In contrast, males (RR, 1.007, 95%CI, 1-1.01) had a higher risk of admission than females (RR, 1.004, 95%CI, 1.001-1.007) to exposure to PM10. People in the age group of 5-65year-olds had a slightly higher risk of admissions caused by air pollutants than the elderly (65+years old) except for a significant effect of PM10 on the risk of cardiovascular admissions was found for the elderly only.},

 abstract = {Compelling evidence supporting the benefits of social engagement in older adults has been increasingly discussed. However, knowledge regarding an intergenerational program is limited. Herein, we provide a targeted review of intergenerational programs by focusing on our novel interventional program, Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy. The Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy program is an intergenerational picture-book reading program launched in 2004. Participants were involved a 3-month intensive weekly training seminar comprising classes about book selection, reading techniques and basic knowledge of children's school life. Subsequently, they participated in group activities that involved playing a hand game, and reading picture books to children at kindergartens, elementary schools and public childcare centers, once every 1-2 weeks. The Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy program has shown improvement of physical and psychological functioning of older adults and healthy upbringing of children. Similarly, Experience Corps - designed to train and place volunteers in participating elementary schools for an academic year during which time they assist teachers - also showed positive effects for older adults' health status and the psychological/academic success of young children in the USA. Health promotion efforts for older adults must support social policy for the creation of meaningful service programs for older adults on a large social scale. As such, an intergenerational program based on the concept of social capital, defined as "features of social organization, such as trust, norms and networks, that can improve the efficacy of society by facilitating coordinated actions," is an effective and sustainable program for health promotion among older adults.},

However, training and promotion of hand hygiene in healthcare settings is an on-going challenge. This paper describes a hand hygiene improvement campaign in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (Scotland, UK) using the SureWash gesture recognition system (SureWash, IRL). The campaign consisted of two phases of three-months each; the first phase involved technology evaluation and familiarization in a variety of settings within the hospital. The second phase involved rotation between two units with specific changes to the incentives for completing the training. There were 2,010 individual training sessions with over 30% outside of office hours. Individuals completed an average of 2.72 training sessions each and 90% of staff passed the assessment. Senior staff noted a change in hand hygiene culture following the campaign and the good-natured competition between staff to demonstrate hand hygiene competence using the SureWash serious game. While the new technology did facilitate the culture change its successful implementation was dependent on a set of incentives for staff and a structured implementation plan.},

Experimental data were collected by extensive trials involving 40 real-end users. A methodology called "scenario engagement" was applied to get participants engaged in a live demonstration with the mediation of a facilitator who assisted elderly people to interact with the system. Results point out that the system can be effectively employed to foster social interaction, particularly when it is introduced in a collective use environment (e.g., Senior Center).

 abstract = {Serious games could be used to improve cognitive functions in the elderly. We evaluated the adoption of a new tablet application dedicated to cognitive stimulation in the elderly. The Stim'Art application offers various serious games to work different cognitive functions (memory, attention, concentration, etc.). The usage of fifteen older adults was followed for six months. The type of the game, the number of launches for each game, the time spent on each game, the difficulty level, the success rate and perceived well-being of users have been studied and compared at the end of the first and the sixth months. The participants have played half an hour per day on average. The average time of playing per day in the sixth month was significantly higher than the average time of playing during the first month (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). The same result was found for the average number of game launches per day (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). However, older people seem not to launch more difficult levels in the last month. The success rate at sixth months was significantly higher than the success rate at the end of the first month (p value < 6.4 * 1010(-4)). Generally, seniors have had an improvement in their wellbeing score judged by themselves. Our study showed that the mobile application receives a good admission from users. The results are promising and can pave the way for improving cognitive function in the elderly patients. The use of tablets and the constitution of serious games in close cooperation with health professionals and elderly patients (the end user), are likely to provide satisfactory results to improve healthcare provided for elderly patients suffering from cognitive disorders.},

 abstract = {Prescribed burnings are conducted in Queensland each year from August until November aiming to decrease the impact of bushfire hazards and maintain the health of vegetation. This study reports chemical characteristics of the ambient aerosol, with a focus on source apportionment of the organic aerosol (OA) fraction, during the prescribed biomass burning (BB) season in Brisbane 2013. All measurements were conducted within the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health (ILAQH) located in Brisbane's Central Business District. Chemical composition, degree of ageing and the influence of BB emission on the air quality of central Brisbane were characterized using a compact Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (cToF-AMS). AMS loadings were dominated by OA (64%), followed by, sulfate (17%), ammonium (14%) and nitrates (5%). Source apportionment was applied on the AMS OA mass spectra via the multilinear engine solver (ME-2) implementation within the recently developed Source Finder (SoFi) interface. Six factors were extracted including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking-related OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), semivolatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA). The aerosol fraction that was attributed to BB factor was 9%, on average over the sampling period. The high proportion of oxygenated OA (72%), typically representing aged emissions, could possess a fraction of oxygenated species transfored from BB components on their way to the sampling site.},

We investigated the association between long-term exposures to outdoor fine particles (PM2.5) and hospitalization for peptic ulcer diseases (PUDs) in a large cohort of Hong Kong Chinese elderly.A total of 66,820 subjects aged ≥65 years who were enrolled in all 18 Government Elderly Health Service centers of Hong Kong participated in the study voluntarily between 1998 and 2001. They were prospectively followed up for more than 10 years. Annual mean exposures to PM2.5 at residence of individuals were estimated by satellite data through linkage with address details including floor level. All hospital admission records of the subjects up to December 31, 2010 were retrieved from the central database of Hospital Authority. We used Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for PUD hospitalization associated with PM2.5 exposure after adjustment for individual and ecological covariates.A total of 60,273 subjects had completed baseline information including medical, socio-demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric data at recruitment. During the follow-up period, 1991 (3.3%) subjects had been hospitalized for PUD. The adjusted HR for PUD hospitalization per 10 μg/m of PM2.5 was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.36, P = 0.02). Further analysis showed that the associations with PM2.5 were significant for gastric ulcers (HR 1.29; 1.09-1.53, P = 0.003) but not for duodenal ulcers (HR 0.98; 0.78 to 1.22, P = 0.81).Long-term exposures to PM2.5 were associated with PUD hospitalization in elder population. The mechanism underlying the PM2.5 in the development of gastric ulcers warrants further research.},

 abstract = {The global prevalence of obesity in the older adult population is growing, an increasing concern in both the developed and developing countries of the world. The study of geriatric obesity and its management is a relatively new area of research, especially pertaining to those with elevated health risks. This review characterizes the state of science for this "fat and frail" population and identifies the many gaps in knowledge where future study is urgently needed. In community dwelling older adults, opportunities to improve both body weight and nutritional status are hampered by inadequate programs to identify and treat obesity, but where support programs exist, there are proven benefits. Nutritional status of the hospitalized older adult should be optimized to overcome the stressors of chronic disease, acute illness, and/or surgery. The least restrictive diets tailored to individual preferences while meeting each patient's nutritional needs will facilitate the energy required for mobility, respiratory sufficiency, immunocompentence, and wound healing. Complications of care due to obesity in the nursing home setting, especially in those with advanced physical and mental disabilities, are becoming more ubiquitous; in almost all of these situations, weight stability is advocated, as some evidence links weight loss with increased mortality. High quality interdisciplinary studies in a variety of settings are needed to identify standards of care and effective treatments for the most vulnerable obese older adults.},

This study investigated the association between the ambient concentrations of PM with varies sizes (5.6-560nm) and a biomarker of acute respiratory inflammation, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), in a panel of 55 elderly people in Shanghai, China. Linear mixed-effect model was fitted to estimate the association between FENO and moving average concentrations of PM, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, and age. Results showed that among the measured particles size range, Aitken-mode (20-100nm) particles had the strongest positive association with increased FENO when using moving average concentration of PM up to 24h prior to visits. The estimates were robust to the adjustment for gender, condition of chronic disease and use of medication, and to the sensitive analysis using different times of visits. The authors concluded that the association between acute respiratory inflammation and PM concentration of fine particulates depended on particle size, and suggested Aitken-mode particles may be the most responsible for this adverse health association.},

Moreover, the simple and fast activation of KTP makes it a viable and potentially superior alternative to traditional ambient assisted living emergency calls. Furthermore, KTP can be further extended to the general population as well and not just be limited for elderly persons.

When compared with a control group of similarly stable 'good sleepers' (n = 64) drawn from the same community sample these persistent subjective insomniacs showed significantly higher levels of constitutional (trait) and transitory (state) anxiety, and neuroticism. Discriminant analysis indicated that elevated levels of neuroticism, reduced health status (as measured by the number of drugs prescribed) and relatively high levels of tea consumption were most closely associated with persistent complaints of poor sleep. Thus, despite the existence of health problems as a major cause of sleep disturbance in later life, personality factors appear to exert a pervasive influence on subjective sleep quality among the 'younger' elderly.},

@article{pmid27330890,
 abstract = {One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of an activity curve, which represents an abstraction of an individual's normal daily routine based on automatically-recognized activities. We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics.},

 abstract = {The use of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies as a means to cope with problems that arise due to an increasing and aging population is becoming usual. AAL technologies are used to prevent, cure and improve the wellness and health conditions of the elderly. However, their adoption and use by older adults is still a major challenge. User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.},

To assess the exposure cancer risk of particulate carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution for the elderly, this study conducted a personal exposure measurement campaign for particulate PAHs in a community of Tianjin, a city in northern China. Personal exposure samples were collected from the elderly in non-heating (August-September, 2009) and heating periods (November-December, 2009), and 12 PAHs individuals were analyzed for risk estimation. Questionnaire and time-activity log were also recorded for each person. The probabilistic risk assessment model was integrated with Toxic Equivalent Factors (TEFs). Considering that the estimation of the applied dose for a given air pollutant is dependent on the inhalation rate, the inhalation rate from both EPA exposure factor book was applied to calculate the carcinogenic risk in this study. Monte Carlo simulation was used as a probabilistic risk assessment model, and risk simulation results indicated that the inhalation-ILCR values for both male and female subjects followed a lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.81 × 10(-6) and 4.57 × 10(-6), respectively. Furthermore, the 95 % probability lung cancer risks were greater than the USEPA acceptable level of 10(-6) for both men and women through the inhalation route, revealing that exposure to PAHs posed an unacceptable potential cancer risk for the elderly in this study. As a result, some measures should be taken to reduce PAHs pollution and the exposure level to decrease the cancer risk for the general population, especially for the elderly.},

 abstract = {Spatial interpolation is employed to improve exposure estimates and to assess adverse health effects associated with environmental risk factors. Since various studies have reported that high ozone (O₃) concentrations can give rise to adverse effects on respiratory symptoms and lung function, we investigated the association between O₃ levels and lung function using a variety of spatial interpolation techniques and evaluated how different methods for estimating exposure may influence health results for a cohort from an industrial complex (Gwangyang Bay) in South Korea in 2009. To estimate daily concentrations of O₃ in each subject, four different methods were used, which include simple averaging, nearest neighbor, inverse distance weighting, and kriging. Also, to compare the association between O₃ levels and lung function by age-groups, we explored ozone's impacts on three age-related groups: children (9-14 years), adults (15-64 years), and the elderly (≥65 years). The overall change of effect size on lung function in each age group tended to show similar patterns for lag and methods for estimating exposure. A significant negative association was only observed between O₃ levels and FVC and FEV₁ for most of the lag and methods in children. The largest effect of O₃ levels was found at the average for the lung function test day and last 2 days (0-2 days). In conclusions, the spatial interpolation methods may benefit in providing individual-level exposure with appropriate temporal resolution from ambient monitors. However, time-activity patterns of residents, monitoring site locations, methodological choices, and other factors should be considered to minimize exposure misclassification.},

 abstract = {The world's population is steadily ageing and as a result, health conditions related to ageing, such as dementia, have become a major public health concern. In 2001, it was estimated that there were almost 5 million Europeans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this figure has been projected to almost double by 2040. About 40% of people over 85 suffer from AD, and another 10% from Parkinson's disease (PD). The majority of AD and PD cases are of sporadic origin and environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology. Epidemiological research identified airborne particulate matter (PM) as one of the environmental factors potentially involved in AD and PD pathogenesis. Also, cumulating evidence demonstrates that the smallest sizes of the inhalable fraction of ambient particulate matter, also referred to as ultrafine particulate matter or nano-sized particles, are capable of inducing effects beyond the respiratory system. Translocation of very small particles via the olfactory epithelium in the nose or via uptake into the circulation has been demonstrated through experimental rodent studies with engineered nanoparticles. Outdoor air pollution has been linked to several health effects including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation that may ultimately result in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. This review aims to evaluate the relationship between exposure to inhaled ambient particles and neurodegeneration.},

She has had repeated, problematic encounters with the health care system over the past 4 years. Caring successfully for an aging parent requires a comprehensive understanding of her unique medical, psychological, and functional status; need for social support; and overall goals of care. Poor communication between and among clinical teams-and with patients and families-is ubiquitous. The patient and family are not consistently listened to, or integrated, into the clinical team. We recount our experiences of one hospitalization and how we addressed the recurring obstacles we faced. Our training and experience gave us a firm understanding of the hazards of hospitalizing an elderly person and the need to be present, engaged, attentive, active, and vigilant. We caught and corrected major mistakes: failure to follow-up abnormal test results, multiple medication errors, undertreatment of pain, poor fall prevention, and inappropriate assessment and placement for rehabilitation. In a dysfunctional health care system, the family is, and must be, the ultimate fail-safe mechanism. We identify potentially effective solutions for the problems we encountered: adoption of dementia-sensitive and patient- and family-centered care, improved communication, better management of information (including better systems for monitoring lab results and for dispensing and reconciling medications), expediting care, changing reimbursement and regulation, and improving discharge planning and placement.},

We investigated the association between placental 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NTp), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and exposure to air pollutants during various time windows of pregnancy. We measured the placental 3-NTp levels of 330 mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early Life (ENVIRONAGE) Study, a Belgian birth cohort study (2010-2013). Daily concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide were interpolated for each mother's residence using a spatiotemporal interpolation method. Placental 3-NTp levels, adjusted for covariates, increased by 35.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9, 60.0) for each interquartile-range increment in entire-pregnancy PM2.5 exposure. The corresponding estimate for BC exposure was 13.9% (95% CI: -0.21, 29.9). These results were driven by the first (PM2.5: 29.0% (95% CI: 4.9, 58.6); BC: 23.6% (95% CI: 4.4, 46.4)) and second (PM2.5: 39.3% (95% CI: 12.3, 72.7)) gestational exposure windows. This link between placental nitrosative stress and exposure to fine particle air pollution during gestation is in line with experimental evidence on cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust exposure. Further research is needed to elucidate potential health consequences experienced later in life through particle-mediated nitrosative stress incurred during fetal life.},

 abstract = {The problem of adequate medical care for the nation's elderly is mounting as this population grows in numbers. While the overall U.S. population has tripled since 1900, the segment over 65 has increased eightfold. Because of the high incidence of chronic illness in persons over 65, they consume a disproportionate amount of health care. Contributing to the problem are pervasive attitudes of ageism in the U.S. culture (including those of physicians), with the result that old people in the U.S. receive fragmented and often substandard medical care, particularly in nursing homes. Although some stirrings of activity in geriatric medicine are apparent in medical schools, not nearly enough faculty are available to teach courses and the interest of medical students is low. Several trends indicate that physician assistants are prepared to help fill the gaps in health care of the elderly. First, as physician extenders, these allied health professionals have demonstrated that they can perform approximately 80% of primary care tasks carried out by physicians at no sacrifice of quality. Second, a large proportion of the current caseload of physician assistants is patients over the age of 65. Third, physician assistant training programs have incorporated a fivefold increase in geriatric courses into their curricula since 1980, and both students and graduates show a high interest in this field. Finally, reimbursement policies of third party payers indicate a trend toward underwriting more physician assistant services. For example, Medicare Part B recently included payment of physician assistants in nursing homes and hospitals.},

In setting the standard values, thresholds and the existence of specific groups in the people with high susceptibility to a certain pollutant are taken into account. The standards are set following minimum effect reports in three branches of health effect studies on air pollution: animal experiments, human exposure, and epidemiology. Safe levels take into account the absence of effects, suspicion of irreversible effects, dwellings of the elderly/infant/sick, epidemiologic growth of nonspecific diseases such as asthma, and so on. Under these conditions, air quality standards become far severer than in the case of industrial health limits.},

The simulation game asked the players to make career choices in accordance with specified scenarios in the areas of politics, economics, health care, foodservice systems, education, and technology. Scenarios could change throughout the game, either by chance or the choice of the players. Major factors affecting individual life-styles, such as acquiring a partner or children, were included. Each player made career choices at 5-year intervals, as he or she moved through life from the present age to age 65. At each age interval, the players discussed the options created by the scenarios in relation to the availability of career choices. Student and instructor response to the activity has been favorable.},

 abstract = {Low ambient temperatures are particularly harmful to the elderly and in the winter in the UK temperatures in some dwellings may fall to 6 degrees C. The World Health Organization recommends a minimal indoor temperature of 18 degrees C and a 2-3 degrees C warmer minimal temperature for rooms occupied by sedentary elderly, young children and the handicapped. Below 16 degrees C, resistance to respiratory infections may be diminished. Both low and high relative humidities promote respiratory illnesses. At temperatures below 12 degrees C, cold extremities and slight lowering of core temperature can induce short-term increases in blood pressure. Raised blood pressure and increased blood viscosity in moderate cold may be important causal factors in the increased winter morbidity and mortality due to heart attacks and strokes. Deep body temperature does not usually fall until resting clothed elderly people are exposed for two or more hours to an ambient temperature of 9 degrees C or below. Statistics available for the UK population do not support the view that there are large numbers of elderly people suffering from clinical hypothermia, though there may be a larger number in whom hypothermia is undiagnosed when the condition occurs secondary to other disorders.},

The environmental milieu of the aged is laden with potent and pervasive implications about successful adaptation. Considerable exploration is required to facilitate a realistic focus upon various theoretical contributions already presented. The influence of stresses and adaptive energy depletions preceding the senescent state is discussed in an effort to facilitate knowledgeable assimilation of the potential impact of the socioeconomic milieu upon the aged. It is the author's contention that the elderly person, upon retirement, presents an adaptive energy reserve highly personalized in its ability to accommodate to change, and especially dependent upon the nature, number and intensity of environmental stressors to adapt, successfully or unsuccessfully, to senescence. Various environmental stressors are identified (e.g., changes in social opportunities and expectations which create new needs and constrict the realm of emotional and vocational influence, thus reducing opportunities and diminishing self-esteem). Heavy emphasis is placed upon role theory, interaction ritual, and transactional analysis. These concepts are extended to the institutional setting - an environment which serves only to magnify mechanisms occurring throghout the social system while adding its own unique dimension to the stressors confronting the elderly.},

Income level appears to be a major determinant of the propensity to live alone. The estimated cross-state equations track about three-quarters of the increase in the propensity to live alone between 1950-1976 and suggest that income growth has been the principal identified influence. Other variables found to affect (positively) the propensity to live alone include mobility, schooling level, and for young people a measure of social climate; non-whites appear to have a somewhat lower propensity to live alone.},

One hundred three married women, aged 40-62, were interviewed about six months after the deaths of their widowed elderly mothers using an in-depth qualitative interview format. As part of the interview, informants were asked to "tell the story of your mother's death," a question designed to elicit a subjectively based narrative account. Analysis of these narrative texts discovered a number of salient themes: the quality of medical care; the personality of the mother; issues of health decision making; the salience of the death scene; and mother-daughter closeness at death. Issues of family dynamics were quite important and permeated each description. In general, the narratives disclosed four aspects of the elder parental death experience: the enmeshment of medical care with the story of the death; the occurrence of pervasive ageism in accounts of the death; impossible dilemmas in terminal care of the aged; and the irreducibility of subjectivity in the daughter's biography of her mother.},

 abstract = {Dementia, delirium and depression are the 3 most prevalent mental disorders in the elderly. While dementia and depression are prevalent in the community, hospitals and nursing homes, delirium is seen most often in acute care hospitals. Much of the management of these syndromes is undertaken by primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists. Therefore, it is imperative that generalist physicians be adept at recognising, evaluating and managing patients with these syndromes. Because no diagnostic tests are pathognomonic of these syndromes, the differential diagnosis hinges on a careful clinical evaluation. The first step is to recognise which of the syndromes is present. Dementia is defined by a chronic loss of intellectual or cognitive function of sufficient severity to interfere with social or occupational function. Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness marked by an attention deficit and a change in cognitive function. Depression is an affective disorder evidenced by a dysphoric mood, but the most pervasive symptom is a loss of ability to enjoy usual activities. It is important to recognise that these syndromes are not mutually exclusive, as dementia frequently coexists with delirium and depression. Furthermore, physical diagnoses, such as chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and endocrine disorders, are frequently associated with depressive symptoms. Given this, a comprehensive evaluation is mandatory. Laboratory tests are necessary to exclude concurrent metabolic, endocrine and infectious disorders, and drug effects. Imaging studies should be obtained selectively in patients with signs and symptoms, such as focal neurological findings and gait disturbances, which are suggestive of structural lesions: stroke, subdural haematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus and brain tumours. Appropriate management involving pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures will result in significant improvement in most patients with these syndromes. Potentially offending drugs should be discontinued. In delirious patients the underlying illness must be treated concomitantly with the use of psychotropics, if necessary. Although no current medications have been shown to have a significant effect on the functional status of patients with the 2 most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, the management of concomitant illness in these patients may result in improved function for as long as a year. Tacrine, an anticholinesterase inhibitor, improves cognitive function slightly in selected patients with Alzheimer's disease over short periods. Finally, the treatment of depression with medications or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in significant reductions in mortality and morbidity.},

In the approach described, a method of progressive contextualization was used by adding different hazards to the risk profile in a single geographic area. The various hazards were applied to the same time and space frame, that of a 24-hour period and in the urban space used by elderly homeless people. Incorporated into the approach are the concepts of high-risk areas and space-time geography, and the theory of disease ecology. The spatial-temporal distribution of resources, factors in the natural environment (patterns of daylight and dark and ambient temperature) and factors in the human-created environment (traffic and crime patterns) were identified as important hazards within the urban environment. Homelessness itself, the effects of aging, the social milieu, and behavior patterns commonly seen in homeless people--particularly, alcohol abuse--were identified as important hazards for elderly homeless people. Each hazard's spatial-temporal pattern within the 24-hour period is discussed. Then the convergence of hazards forming an interactive effect is discussed. Finally, approaches to nursing interventions aimed at reducing risk are presented.},

 abstract = {Previous research has documented qualitative changes in certain cognitive abilities during the older adult years, such as in short-term memory, perceptual and motor skills, and attentional capacities. Other work has suggested that a number of significant age-related changes, across a variety of cognitive abilities, are based on social experiences, such as occupational or recreational activities. The current study is based on earlier research by Perlmutter and her colleagues (1990) and examines age and skill-related differences among adults engaged in a social-recreational activity. BINGO players, ranging in age from nineteen to seventy-four, and having from less than two months to over twenty years of playing experience, were given a variety of psychometric, cognitive, and experimental measures. The participants were also observed as they played real BINGO games. No age-related differences were found on the psychometric or memory measures, suggesting that BINGO playing experience may have positive benefits for many older adults. Skilled players at all age levels were found to be more efficient in their game-playing actions. The oldest and most experienced players did not differ from the younger, equally experienced, players on the cognitive and skill-based tasks. These findings demonstrate the need to investigate adaptive competence in those situations in which social-environmental factors play a role in enhancing older adults' cognitive skills.},

 abstract = {To investigate the acute respiratory health effects of ambient air pollution, the number of emergency of urgent daily respiratory admissions to 168 acute care hospitals in Ontario were related to estimates of exposure to ozone and sulfates in the vicinity of each hospital. Ozone levels were obtained from 22 monitoring stations maintained by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment for the period January 1, 1983 to December 31, 1988. Daily levels of sulfates were recorded at nine monitoring stations representing three different networks operated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada. Positive and statistically significant associations were found between hospital admissions and both ozone and sulfates recorded on the day of admission and up to 3 days prior to the date of admission. Five percent of daily respiratory admissions in the months of May to August were associated with ozone, with sulfates accounting for an additional 1% of these admissions. Ozone was a stronger predictor of admissions than sulfates. Positive and statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations were observed between the ozone-sulfate pollution mix and admissions for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. Positive associations were also found in all age groups, with the largest impact on infants (15% of admissions associated with the ozone-sulfate pollution mix) and the least effects on the elderly (4%). Temperature had no effect on the air pollution-admission relationship. Ozone (lagged 1 day) and sulfates (lagged 1 day) displayed a positive association with respiratory admissions for 91 and 100% of the 168 acute care hospitals, respectively. Air pollution was not related to a class of nonrespiratory admissions, which served as a negative control, nor was it related to admissions in the winter months of December to March, when ozone and sulfate levels are low and when people spend a considerable amount of time indoors.},

A nurse's pessimistic viewpoint can translate into a loss of dignity, identity and decision-making power for seniors. It is essential that nurses use experiential and scientific knowledge to promote a better understanding of the aging process as part of normal development. These two types of knowledge will enable them to understand the process in its entirety and to grasp the true meaning of being old. Chronological age is not the only clue to biological aging. There is no unique model. Aging is a combination of various profiles of complex relationships between biological, psychological and social variables.

Air pollution data were obtained from nine monitoring stations operated by the Departamento del Distrito Federal. Mortality data were provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía, e Informática. Increases in numbers of deaths were positively associated with elevated air pollution levels on the same day and on the previous day. The magnitude of the increases was small but statistically significant, after Poisson regression models were used to adjust for temperature and long-term trends. In models using data for a single pollutant, the "crude" ratio for total mortality associated with an increase of 100 parts per billion (ppb)* in one-hour maximum ozone concentration was 1.029 (95% CI 1.015, 1.044). A moving average of ozone showed a stronger association (rate ratio [RR] = 1.048, 95% CI 1.025, 1.070), and excess mortality (an increase in the number of deaths, relative to the average on days with low pollution levels) was more evident for persons over 65 years of age. Separate analyses of the effect of elevated ozone for different areas of the city showed similar results, but they were not statistically significant. Other pollutants also were related to mortality. The RR was 1.075 (95% CI 0.984, 1.062) per 100-ppb increase for sulfur dioxide and 1.049 (95% CI 1.030, 1.067) per 100 micrograms/m3 increase in total suspended particulates (TSP) when these pollutants were considered in separate models. However, when all three pollutants were considered simultaneously, only TSP remained associated with mortality, indicating excess mortality of 5% per 100 micrograms/m3 increase [RR = 1.052, 95% CI 1.034, 1.072]. The excess mortality associated with TSP is consistent with that observed in other cities in America and Europe. This study provides some evidence that ozone is associated with all-cause mortality and with mortality among the elderly after controlling for long-term cycles. However, ozone levels exhibited little or no effect on mortality rates when other air pollutants were considered simultaneously. Particulate matter appeared to be an important pollutant; it independently predicted changes in mortality. Nevertheless, because of the complexity and variability of the mixtures to which people are exposed, it is difficult to attribute the observed effects to a single pollutant. The technical feasibility and scientific validity of isolating the effect of single pollutants in such complex mixtures requires further research and careful consideration. Given the large population living in and exposed to ambient air pollution in Mexico City and other metropolises throughout the world, these small but significant associations of mortality with air pollution indices are of public health concern.},

 abstract = {Studies pertaining to health promoting behavior in daily life have received scant attention among medical anthropologists. The present study addresses this issue by means of an empirical analysis of perceptions and behaviors concerning a daily food item -eggs. Data were collected via in-depth interviews as well as participant observation in four retirement homes-two in Los Angeles and two in Taipei, Taiwan. The results reveal that practices of egg-restriction are pervasive throughout the four homes. Cholesterol has become a commonly-discussed issue in the daily lives of the 203 residents interviewed, and many of them were found to be preoccupied with the risk involved in excess consumption (especially of egg yolks) and increased serum cholesterol levels. Four forces: health professionals, family members, peer groups and mass media play important roles in constructing egg-consumption behaviors among the elderly subjects. The cognitive, psychological and behavioral impact of health information on elderly subjects has been discussed herein. It may be argued that the 'egg issue' reflects a shift in previous health paradigm thinking due to the biomedicalization of health promotion among Chinese elderly.},

 abstract = {Although elderly inmates form a small minority in the U.S. prison population (6.6%), this number is expected to increase by 2005. Elderly prisoners consist of first-time offenders, habitual offenders, and those who have "aged in place" (received very long sentences at a young age). Violence is an identified stressor affecting the elderly prisoner. This enduring stressor can add to physical deterioration, particularly in the inmate with chronic illness. Violence in prison falls into three categories: prisoner-prisoner, staff-prisoner, or prisoner-staff (Clear & Cole, 1994). Prisoner-prisoner incidents account for the majority of violence within prison systems. The convict in today's prison will use extremes of violence to combat threats to his or her reputation or self-concept of "machismo," or if the inmate feels "disrespected." The aging prisoner may have chronic, pervasive stress levels disguised under a tough veneer, although he or she may no longer be strong enough physically or emotionally to fend off potential attackers. Interventions with elderly prisoners include thorough physical and cognitive assessment, including signs and symptoms of depression or stress related to environmental disturbances. Educational training for correctional staff about age-specific developmental changes is necessary. Building partnerships with community, state, and national organizations can assist elderly inmates in their adjustment to prison and foster successful community release programs. Special care units may be considered for frail elderly inmates or those with chronic health problems.},

 abstract = {Population-based studies of hospital usage have been used to identify the ongoing adverse impacts of photochemical air pollutants on respiratory health. In this study we examined the relationship between the number of daily emergency room (ER) visits for respiratory illnesses (25 hospitals) and outdoor air pollution in Montreal, Quebec (June-August, 1989-1990). Air pollutants measured included 1- and 8-h maximum ozone (O3) and estimated particulate matter < 2.5 microns in aerometric diameter (PM2.5). Seasonal and day-of-week trends, autocorrelation, temperature, and relative humidity were controlled for in-time series regressions. Although O3 levels never exceeded the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 120 ppb (maximum day, 106 ppb), statistically significant (P < 0.01) relationships were found between respiratory ER visits for patients over the age of 64 and both 1- and 8-h maximum O3 measured 1 day prior to the ER visit day during the 1989 summer: ER visits were 18.7% higher than average (95% Cl, 6.5-30.9%) for a mean increase of 44 ppb O3 (1-h maximum), and 21.8% higher than average (95% Cl, 9.7-33.8%) for a mean increase of 38 ppb O3 (8-h maximum). There was an association between respiratory ER visits for the elderly and estimated PM2.5 lagged 1 day (0.1 visit/microgram/m3 PM2.5, P < 0.07), but this was confounded by both temperature and O3. The only finding for a reference group of nonrespiratory conditions was an inverse association between ER visits for infants and O3, but this was confounded by weather. These findings confirm the impression that while air quality standards may protect the respiratory health of the general population, this is not the case for susceptible subgroups such as the elderly.},

 abstract = {Previous studies of preferences for health insurance benefits have required individuals to make a series of complex and repetitive decisions, and have assumed that all insured benefits are desirable. This study reports the development and testing of a simple, innovative instrument to measure preferences for health insurance benefits. The newly developed instrument (Puzzle) is designed to allow subjects to select health benefits in a way that underscores the trade-offs dictated by budgets and costs. A "puzzle-like" frame representing budget constraints and "puzzle piece" benefit cards proportionately sized to represent the premium price of a single year's coverage comprise the instrument. In a comparison procedure (Money Game), participants "purchase" individual benefits by exchanging "play" money for benefit tokens. The Puzzle's utility was assessed by examining the convergence of results from both instruments and the subject's ratings of and preference for the instruments. One hundred five elderly Medicare enrollees seen in the general Internal Medicine outpatient clinic of a major southeastern teaching hospital were interviewed. Subjects answered interviewer-administered questionnaires and completed both the Puzzle and the Money Game. Both McNemar's test and Kendall's tau-b indicated a high degree of concordance between benefit choices made using the two instruments. Descriptive statistics demonstrated that the Puzzle was clear, easy to use, understandable, and preferred to the Money Game. The results suggest that the Puzzle is a promising tool for assessing health insurance coverage preferences under circumstances of limited expenditures, which can be modified for use with various populations who face limited insurance benefits.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this follow-up study was to describe, explain and interpret how new graduate nurses perceived their adaptation to the 'real world' of hospital nursing and what they perceived as major influences on their moral values and ethical roles in the 2 years following graduation. The method was qualitative, specifically grounded theory. The earlier study took place when informants were senior nursing students. The follow-up study began after the informants had been practising for 1 year. Research questions guiding the study were: How do new graduate nurses describe their adaptation to the 'real world' of hospital nursing? What do they describe as factors influencing their moral values and ethical roles in hospital nursing? Preserving moral integrity was the basic psycho-social process that explained how these new graduate nurses adapted to the real world of hospital nursing. Six stages of this process were identified: vulnerability; getting through the day; coping with moral distress; alienation from self; coping with lost ideals; and integration of new professional self-concept. Moral distress was a consequence of the effort to preserve moral integrity. It is the result of believing that one is not living up to one's moral convictions. Data supported that the most pervasive attributes of moral distress were self-criticism and self-blame, as informants judged their actions against their moral convictions and their standards of what a good nurse would do. Moral distress was an acute form of psychological disorientation in which informants questioned their professional knowledge, what kind of nurses they were and what kind of nurses they were becoming. Theoretical explanations of these findings are grounded in social interaction and moral psychology theories.},
