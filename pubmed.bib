We investigated the association between placental 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NTp), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and exposure to air pollutants during various time windows of pregnancy. We measured the placental 3-NTp levels of 330 mother-newborn pairs enrolled in the Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early Life (ENVIRONAGE) Study, a Belgian birth cohort study (2010-2013). Daily concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and nitrogen dioxide were interpolated for each mother's residence using a spatiotemporal interpolation method. Placental 3-NTp levels, adjusted for covariates, increased by 35.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9, 60.0) for each interquartile-range increment in entire-pregnancy PM2.5 exposure. The corresponding estimate for BC exposure was 13.9% (95% CI: -0.21, 29.9). These results were driven by the first (PM2.5: 29.0% (95% CI: 4.9, 58.6); BC: 23.6% (95% CI: 4.4, 46.4)) and second (PM2.5: 39.3% (95% CI: 12.3, 72.7)) gestational exposure windows. This link between placental nitrosative stress and exposure to fine particle air pollution during gestation is in line with experimental evidence on cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust exposure. Further research is needed to elucidate potential health consequences experienced later in life through particle-mediated nitrosative stress incurred during fetal life.},

Caring successfully for an aging parent requires a comprehensive understanding of her unique medical, psychological, and functional status; need for social support; and overall goals of care. Poor communication between and among clinical teams-and with patients and families-is ubiquitous. The patient and family are not consistently listened to, or integrated, into the clinical team. We recount our experiences of one hospitalization and how we addressed the recurring obstacles we faced. Our training and experience gave us a firm understanding of the hazards of hospitalizing an elderly person and the need to be present, engaged, attentive, active, and vigilant. We caught and corrected major mistakes: failure to follow-up abnormal test results, multiple medication errors, undertreatment of pain, poor fall prevention, and inappropriate assessment and placement for rehabilitation. In a dysfunctional health care system, the family is, and must be, the ultimate fail-safe mechanism. We identify potentially effective solutions for the problems we encountered: adoption of dementia-sensitive and patient- and family-centered care, improved communication, better management of information (including better systems for monitoring lab results and for dispensing and reconciling medications), expediting care, changing reimbursement and regulation, and improving discharge planning and placement.},

About 40% of people over 85 suffer from AD, and another 10% from Parkinson's disease (PD). The majority of AD and PD cases are of sporadic origin and environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology. Epidemiological research identified airborne particulate matter (PM) as one of the environmental factors potentially involved in AD and PD pathogenesis. Also, cumulating evidence demonstrates that the smallest sizes of the inhalable fraction of ambient particulate matter, also referred to as ultrafine particulate matter or nano-sized particles, are capable of inducing effects beyond the respiratory system. Translocation of very small particles via the olfactory epithelium in the nose or via uptake into the circulation has been demonstrated through experimental rodent studies with engineered nanoparticles. Outdoor air pollution has been linked to several health effects including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation that may ultimately result in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. This review aims to evaluate the relationship between exposure to inhaled ambient particles and neurodegeneration.},

Since various studies have reported that high ozone (O₃) concentrations can give rise to adverse effects on respiratory symptoms and lung function, we investigated the association between O₃ levels and lung function using a variety of spatial interpolation techniques and evaluated how different methods for estimating exposure may influence health results for a cohort from an industrial complex (Gwangyang Bay) in South Korea in 2009. To estimate daily concentrations of O₃ in each subject, four different methods were used, which include simple averaging, nearest neighbor, inverse distance weighting, and kriging. Also, to compare the association between O₃ levels and lung function by age-groups, we explored ozone's impacts on three age-related groups: children (9-14 years), adults (15-64 years), and the elderly (≥65 years). The overall change of effect size on lung function in each age group tended to show similar patterns for lag and methods for estimating exposure. A significant negative association was only observed between O₃ levels and FVC and FEV₁ for most of the lag and methods in children. The largest effect of O₃ levels was found at the average for the lung function test day and last 2 days (0-2 days). In conclusions, the spatial interpolation methods may benefit in providing individual-level exposure with appropriate temporal resolution from ambient monitors. However, time-activity patterns of residents, monitoring site locations, methodological choices, and other factors should be considered to minimize exposure misclassification.},

To assess the exposure cancer risk of particulate carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution for the elderly, this study conducted a personal exposure measurement campaign for particulate PAHs in a community of Tianjin, a city in northern China. Personal exposure samples were collected from the elderly in non-heating (August-September, 2009) and heating periods (November-December, 2009), and 12 PAHs individuals were analyzed for risk estimation. Questionnaire and time-activity log were also recorded for each person. The probabilistic risk assessment model was integrated with Toxic Equivalent Factors (TEFs). Considering that the estimation of the applied dose for a given air pollutant is dependent on the inhalation rate, the inhalation rate from both EPA exposure factor book was applied to calculate the carcinogenic risk in this study. Monte Carlo simulation was used as a probabilistic risk assessment model, and risk simulation results indicated that the inhalation-ILCR values for both male and female subjects followed a lognormal distribution with a mean of 4.81 × 10(-6) and 4.57 × 10(-6), respectively. Furthermore, the 95 % probability lung cancer risks were greater than the USEPA acceptable level of 10(-6) for both men and women through the inhalation route, revealing that exposure to PAHs posed an unacceptable potential cancer risk for the elderly in this study. As a result, some measures should be taken to reduce PAHs pollution and the exposure level to decrease the cancer risk for the general population, especially for the elderly.},

User Experience (UX) evaluations aim at aiding on this task, by identifying the experience that a user has while interacting with an AAL technology under particular conditions. This may help designing better products and improve user engagement and adoption of AAL solutions. However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%.

We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment. Our evaluation indicates that correlations do exist between behavior and health changes and that these changes can be automatically detected using smart homes, machine learning, and big data-based pervasive analytics.},

    abstract = {One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.},

Development of smart decision support systems to support the promotion of health smart homes has also emerged taking advantage of the plethora of smart, inexpensive and unobtrusive monitoring sensors, devices and software tools. To this end, a smart monitoring system has been used in order to extract meaningful information about television (TV) usage patterns and subsequently associate them with clinical findings of experts. The smart TV operating state remote monitoring system was installed in four elderly women homes and gathered data for more than 11 months. Results suggest that TV daily usage (time the TV is turned on) can predict mental health change. Conclusively, the authors suggest that collection of smart device usage patterns could strengthen the inference capabilities of existing health DSSs applied in uncontrolled settings such as real senior homes.},

Taking advantage of the popularity, portability, and inherent technology of smartphones, we present an emergency application for smartphones, designated as knock-to-panic (KTP). This innovative and novel system enables users to simply hit their devices in order to send an alarm signal to an emergency service. This application is a complete and autonomous emergency system, and can provide an economic, reliable, and unobtrusive method for elderly monitoring or safety protection. Moreover, the simple and fast activation of KTP makes it a viable and potentially superior alternative to traditional ambient assisted living emergency calls. Furthermore, KTP can be further extended to the general population as well and not just be limited for elderly persons. The proposed method is a threshold-based algorithm and is designed to require a low battery power consumption. The evaluation of the performance of the algorithm in collected data indicates that both sensitivity and specificity are above 90%.},

Starting in 2003 with personal health management systems, pHealth has continuously extended its scope evolving to a truly interdisciplinary event by covering technological and biomedical facilities, legal, ethical, social, and organizational requirements and impacts as well as necessary basic research for enabling the future proof care paradigms. Thereby, pHealth increasingly combines medical devices and eHealth based services with public health, prevention, social and elderly care, wellness and personal fitness to establish participatory, predictive, personalized, preventive, and effective care settings. Smart mobile systems, eHealth and telemedicine have become important enablers for ubiquitous pervasive health as the next generation health services. Social media and gamification has added even further knowledge to pHealth both as a business domain and as a community safety-net. The pHealth2016 conference aims to further emphasise on the integration of biology and medical data, systems and information using mobile technologies through the development of micro-nano-bio smart systems for pHealth emphasizing on personalized health, virtual care, precision medicine, big bio-data management and analytics as well as security, privacy and safety issues. We welcome you to the city of Heraklion on the beautiful island of Crete for the pHealth 2016 conference to share experiences and results, and to open up for the future! Following a long-term tradition, pHealth 2016 is supported by the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI)but also the HL7 International. The pHealth 2016 presentations are complemented by demonstrations of practical artifacts and solutions as well as by a students' poster competition. This proceedings volume covers 2 keynotes and 2 specially invited talks, but also 21 oral presentations selected from more than 45 submissions to the pHealth 2015 conference, and 10 poster presentations. All submissions have been carefully and critically reviewed by at least two independent experts from other than the authors' home countries, and additionally by at least one member of the Scientific Program Committee. The performed highly selective review process resulted in a full papers rejection rate of more than 30%, thereby guaranteeing a high scientific level of the pHealth 2016 published papers. The editors are indebted to the acknowledged and highly experienced reviewers for having essentially contributed to the quality of the conference and the book at hand. Both the pHealth 2016 Conference and the publication of the pHealth 2016 proceedings at IOS Press would not have been possible without the supporters and sponsors Health Level 7 International (HL7 International), and European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI). The editors are also grateful to the dedicated efforts of the Local Organizing Committee members and their supporters for carefully and smoothly preparing and operating the conference. They especially thank all team members from IMBB-FORTH and CERTH/INAB-AUTH Lab of Computing &amp; Medical Informatics, for their dedication to the event. Nicos Maglaveras, Electra Gizeli (Editors).},

Linear mixed-effect model was fitted to estimate the association between FENO and moving average concentrations of PM, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, and age. Results showed that among the measured particles size range, Aitken-mode (20-100nm) particles had the strongest positive association with increased FENO when using moving average concentration of PM up to 24h prior to visits. The estimates were robust to the adjustment for gender, condition of chronic disease and use of medication, and to the sensitive analysis using different times of visits. The authors concluded that the association between acute respiratory inflammation and PM concentration of fine particulates depended on particle size, and suggested Aitken-mode particles may be the most responsible for this adverse health association.},

The study of geriatric obesity and its management is a relatively new area of research, especially pertaining to those with elevated health risks. This review characterizes the state of science for this "fat and frail" population and identifies the many gaps in knowledge where future study is urgently needed. In community dwelling older adults, opportunities to improve both body weight and nutritional status are hampered by inadequate programs to identify and treat obesity, but where support programs exist, there are proven benefits. Nutritional status of the hospitalized older adult should be optimized to overcome the stressors of chronic disease, acute illness, and/or surgery. The least restrictive diets tailored to individual preferences while meeting each patient's nutritional needs will facilitate the energy required for mobility, respiratory sufficiency, immunocompentence, and wound healing. Complications of care due to obesity in the nursing home setting, especially in those with advanced physical and mental disabilities, are becoming more ubiquitous; in almost all of these situations, weight stability is advocated, as some evidence links weight loss with increased mortality. High quality interdisciplinary studies in a variety of settings are needed to identify standards of care and effective treatments for the most vulnerable obese older adults.},

All measurements were conducted within the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health (ILAQH) located in Brisbane's Central Business District. Chemical composition, degree of ageing and the influence of BB emission on the air quality of central Brisbane were characterized using a compact Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (cToF-AMS). AMS loadings were dominated by OA (64%), followed by, sulfate (17%), ammonium (14%) and nitrates (5%). Source apportionment was applied on the AMS OA mass spectra via the multilinear engine solver (ME-2) implementation within the recently developed Source Finder (SoFi) interface. Six factors were extracted including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking-related OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), semivolatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA). The aerosol fraction that was attributed to BB factor was 9%, on average over the sampling period. The high proportion of oxygenated OA (72%), typically representing aged emissions, could possess a fraction of oxygenated species transfored from BB components on their way to the sampling site.},

The type of the game, the number of launches for each game, the time spent on each game, the difficulty level, the success rate and perceived well-being of users have been studied and compared at the end of the first and the sixth months. The participants have played half an hour per day on average. The average time of playing per day in the sixth month was significantly higher than the average time of playing during the first month (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). The same result was found for the average number of game launches per day (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). However, older people seem not to launch more difficult levels in the last month. The success rate at sixth months was significantly higher than the success rate at the end of the first month (p value < 6.4 * 1010(-4)). Generally, seniors have had an improvement in their wellbeing score judged by themselves. Our study showed that the mobile application receives a good admission from users. The results are promising and can pave the way for improving cognitive function in the elderly patients. The use of tablets and the constitution of serious games in close cooperation with health professionals and elderly patients (the end user), are likely to provide satisfactory results to improve healthcare provided for elderly patients suffering from cognitive disorders.},

Results point out that the system can be effectively employed to foster social interaction, particularly when it is introduced in a collective use environment (e.g., Senior Center). Although the focus of the investigation was on information and communication technology-enabled social environments, the end users themselves strongly suggested to include in future system releases extra functions considered as essential opportunities for their potential digital lives: that is, medical or health services and bridges toward public administration.},

However, training and promotion of hand hygiene in healthcare settings is an on-going challenge. This paper describes a hand hygiene improvement campaign in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (Scotland, UK) using the SureWash gesture recognition system (SureWash, IRL). The campaign consisted of two phases of three-months each; the first phase involved technology evaluation and familiarization in a variety of settings within the hospital. The second phase involved rotation between two units with specific changes to the incentives for completing the training. There were 2,010 individual training sessions with over 30% outside of office hours. Individuals completed an average of 2.72 training sessions each and 90% of staff passed the assessment. Senior staff noted a change in hand hygiene culture following the campaign and the good-natured competition between staff to demonstrate hand hygiene competence using the SureWash serious game. While the new technology did facilitate the culture change its successful implementation was dependent on a set of incentives for staff and a structured implementation plan.},

Herein, we provide a targeted review of intergenerational programs by focusing on our novel interventional program, Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy. The Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy program is an intergenerational picture-book reading program launched in 2004. Participants were involved a 3-month intensive weekly training seminar comprising classes about book selection, reading techniques and basic knowledge of children's school life. Subsequently, they participated in group activities that involved playing a hand game, and reading picture books to children at kindergartens, elementary schools and public childcare centers, once every 1-2 weeks. The Research on Productivity through Intergenerational Sympathy program has shown improvement of physical and psychological functioning of older adults and healthy upbringing of children. Similarly, Experience Corps - designed to train and place volunteers in participating elementary schools for an academic year during which time they assist teachers - also showed positive effects for older adults' health status and the psychological/academic success of young children in the USA. Health promotion efforts for older adults must support social policy for the creation of meaningful service programs for older adults on a large social scale. As such, an intergenerational program based on the concept of social capital, defined as "features of social organization, such as trust, norms and networks, that can improve the efficacy of society by facilitating coordinated actions," is an effective and sustainable program for health promotion among older adults.},

Our study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of air pollutants including PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the largest city in Vietnam. Data on hospitalization from the two largest hospitals in HCMC and daily records of PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and meteorological data were collected from February 2004 to December 2007. A time-series regression analysis with distributed lag model was applied for data analysis. Changes in levels of NO2 and PM10 were strongly associated with hospital admissions for both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (CVD); whereas levels of SO2 were only moderately associated with respiratory and CVD hospital admissions and O3 concentration was not associated with any of them. For a 10μg/m(3) increase of each air pollutant, the risk of respiratory admissions increased from 0.7% to 8% while the risk of CVD admissions increased from 0.5% to 4%. Females were found to be more sensitive than males to exposure to air pollutants in regard to respiratory diseases. In regard to CVD, females (RR, 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had a slightly higher risk of admissions than males (RR, 1.03, 95% CI, 1-1.06) to exposure to NO2. In contrast, males (RR, 1.007, 95%CI, 1-1.01) had a higher risk of admission than females (RR, 1.004, 95%CI, 1.001-1.007) to exposure to PM10. People in the age group of 5-65year-olds had a slightly higher risk of admissions caused by air pollutants than the elderly (65+years old) except for a significant effect of PM10 on the risk of cardiovascular admissions was found for the elderly only.},

Using data retrieved from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurements Units (IMUs) and/or SmartPhones (SPs), our algorithm is able to detect falls using features extracted from accelerometer and gyroscope. While mostly of the mobile-based solutions for fall management deal only with accelerometer data, in the proposed approach we combine the instantaneous acceleration magnitude vector with changes of the user's heading in a Threshold Based Algorithm (TBA). In such a way, we were able to handle falls detection with minimal computational load, increasing the overall system accuracy with respect to traditional fall management methods. Experimental results show the strong detection performance of the proposed solution in discriminating between falls and typical Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) presenting fall-like acceleration patterns.},

The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop a "voice" for senior farmers by examining aging farmers' and their families' perspectives of farm work, associated injury risks, and methods to decrease those risks. Focus groups and personal interviews were used to collect data from 81 participants across seven U.S. states. The findings reflect the collective and verified voice of the study group. The Health Belief Model was applied and revealed differences between farmers and their family members; however, the need and desire to continue self-directed work was ubiquitous. Seniors reported external risks, while family members were more likely to name risks associated with the health of the senior farmer. Both groups cited stress as an injury risk. Posing risk to others was the trigger point for senior farmers to make behavior changes. Family members reported uneasiness in initiating safety conversations. Adaptation of existing interventions for self-assessment of risk was rejected. Use of the popular farm press and respected local resources were desired as avenues for safety education. Humor and stories were highly regarded. Interventions should be tailored for the target audience. These new insights into the risk perceptions of senior farmers and their families may result in more appropriate actions by health professionals, extension staff social workers, vocational rehabilitation specialists, and others who work with farm populations.},

    abstract = {In developed countries, public health systems are under pressure due to the increasing percentage of population over 65. In this context, homecare based on ambient intelligence technology seems to be a suitable solution to allow elderly people to continue to enjoy the comforts of home and help optimize medical resources. Thus, current technological developments make it possible to build complex homecare applications that demand, among others, flexibility mechanisms for being able to evolve as context does (adaptability), as well as avoiding service disruptions in the case of node failure (availability). The solution proposed in this paper copes with these flexibility requirements through the whole life-cycle of the target applications: from design phase to runtime. The proposed domain modeling approach allows medical staff to design customized applications, taking into account the adaptability needs. It also guides software developers during system implementation. The application execution is managed by a multi-agent based middleware, making it possible to meet adaptation requirements, assuring at the same time the availability of the system even for stateful applications.},

Recently, we generated a new u-healthcare system using a voice inception technique for elderly diabetic patients to communicate information about their glucose control, physical activity, and diet more easily. In a randomized clinical trial, 70 diabetic patients aged 60-85 years were assigned randomly to a standard care group or u-healthcare group for 6 months. The primary end points were the changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glucose fluctuation assessed by the mean amplitude glycemic excursion (MAGE). Changes in body weight, lifestyle, and knowledge about diabetes were also investigated. After 6 months, the HbA1c levels decreased significantly in the u-healthcare group (from 8.6 ± 1.0% to 7.5 ± 0.6%) compared with the standard care group (from 8.7 ± 0.9% to 8.2 ± 1.1%, P < 0.01). The MAGE decreased more in the u-healthcare group than in the standard care group. Systolic blood pressure and body weight decreased and liver functions improved in the u-healthcare group, but not in the standard care group. The u-healthcare system with voice inception technique was effective in achieving glycemic control without hypoglycemia in elderly diabetic patients (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01891474).},

We aimed to examine effects of ambient temperatures on city-/gender-/age-/education-specific diabetes mortality in nine Chinese cities using a two-stage analysis. Distributed lag non-linear model was first applied to estimate the city-specific non-linear and delayed effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality. Pooled effects of temperatures on diabetes mortality were then obtained using meta-analysis, based on restricted maximum likelihood. We found that heat effects were generally acute and followed by a period of mortality displacement, while cold effects could last for over two weeks. The pooled relative risks of extreme high (99th percentile of temperature) and high temperature (90th percentile of temperature) were 1.29 (95%CI: 1.11-1.47) and 1.11 (1.03-1.19) over lag 0-21 days, compared with the 75th percentile of temperature. In contrast, the pooled relative risks over lag 0-21 days were 1.44 (1.25-1.66) for extreme low (1st percentile of temperature) and 1.20 (1.12-1.30) for low temperature (10th percentile of temperature), compared to 25th percentile of temperature. The estimate of heat effects was relatively higher among females than that among males, with opposite trend for cold effects, and the estimates of heat and cold effects were particularly higher among the elderly and those with low education, although the differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). These findings have important public health implications for protecting diabetes patients from adverse ambient temperatures.},

The purpose of this study is to explore how lifelong learning and a degree attainment in midlife become embedded into new aging practices. The study will focus on a specific group of aging workers who attained a Master's degree from Finnish universities in their fifties. In order to better understand the aging experiences of these older graduates, this study seeks to address how they construct the meaning of aging in relation to their own educational and professional status. The data consist of 14 life-history interviews, which were analyzed as narrative identity performances. Differentiating oneself from the stereotype of physical and mental decline and positioning oneself in a favorable way in inter-generational relations were common ways of approaching aging. Age-negotiation and ambivalence about aging were expressed by structuring narratives around clear oppositions and contradictions. University studies at age 50+ became a talking point in countering cultural age-stereotypes, because it showed that aging workers could still accomplish significant goals and "renew" oneself intellectually. University studies also enabled collaboration with the younger generation and the breaking of narrow age boundaries.},

Aging leads to a decline and deterioration of functional properties at the cellular, tissue and organ level. This loss of functional properties yields to a loss of homeostasis and decreased adaptability to internal and external stress. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, weight loss, and low activity that is associated with adverse health outcomes. Frailty manifests as an age-related, biological vulnerability to stressors and decreased physiological reserves. Ambient air pollution exposure affects human health, and elderly people appear to be particularly susceptible to its adverse effects. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of air pollution in the modulation of several biological mechanisms involved in aging. Evidence is presented on how air pollution can modify the bidirectional association between successful and pathological aging throughout the frailty conditions.},

Some people object, though, that machines of this kind furnish human-robot interaction characterized by inauthentic relationships. In particular, robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been charged with substituting mindless mimicry of human behaviour for the real presence of conscious caring offered by human nurses. When thus viewed as deceptive, the robots also have prompted corresponding concerns regarding their potential psychological, moral, and spiritual implications for people who will be interacting socially with these machines. The foregoing objections and concerns can be assessed quite differently, depending upon ambient religious beliefs or metaphysical presuppositions. The complaints may be set aside as unnecessary, for example, within religious traditions for which even current robots can be viewed as presenting spiritual aspects. Elsewhere, technological cultures may reject the complaints as expression of outdated superstition, holding that the machines eventually will enjoy a consciousness described entirely in materialist and behaviourist terms. While recognizing such assessments, the authors of this essay propose that the heart of the foregoing objections and concerns may be evaluated, in part, scientifically - albeit with a conclusion recommending fundamental revisions in AI modelling of human mental life. Specifically, considerations now favour introduction of AI models using interactive classical and quantum computation. Without this change, the answer to the essay's title question arguably is 'no' - with it, the answer plausibly becomes 'maybe'. Either outcome holds very interesting implications for nurses.},

Unfortunately, the large majority of existing research had focused on health effects of air pollution for one pollutant or for one pollutant with control for the independent effects of a small number of copollutants. Limitations in existing statistical methods are at least partially responsible for this lack of information on joint effects. The goal of this project was to fill this gap by developing flexible statistical methods to estimate the joint effects of multiple pollutants, while allowing for potential nonlinear or nonadditive associations between a given pollutant and the health outcome of interest.},

Considerable epidemiological evidence indicates air pollution, particularly particulate matter (PM), as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the developed countries. The main objective of our review is to assess the levels and sources of PM across the Middle East area and to search evidence for the relationship between PM exposure and CVD. An extensive review of the published literature pertaining to the subject (2000-2013) was conducted using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar databases. We reveal that low utilization of public transport, ageing vehicle fleet and the increasing number of personal cars in the developing countries all contribute to the traffic congestion and aggravate the pollution problem. The annual average values of PM pollutants in the Middle East region are much higher than the World Health Organization 2006 guidelines (PM2.5 = 10 μg/m(3), PM10 = 20 μg/m(3)). We uncover evidence on the association between PM and CVD in 4 Middle East countries: Iran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The findings are in light of the international figures. Ambient PM pollution is considered a potential risk factor for platelet activation and atherosclerosis and has been found to be linked with an increased risk for mortality and hospital admissions due to CVD. This review highlights the importance of developing a strategy to improve air quality and reduce outdoor air pollution in the developing countries, particularly in the Middle East. Future studies should weigh the potential impact of PM on the overall burden of cardiac diseases.},

    abstract = {Multi-pollutant air pollution (i.e., several pollutants reaching very high concentrations simultaneously) frequently occurs in many regions across China. Air quality index (AQI) is used worldwide to inform the public about levels of air pollution and associated health risks. The current AQI approach used in China is based on the maximum value of individual pollutants, and does not consider the combined health effects of exposure to multiple pollutants. In this study, two novel alternative indices--aggregate air quality index (AAQI) and health-risk based air quality index (HAQI)--were calculated based on data collected in six megacities of China (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shjiazhuang, Xi'an, and Wuhan) during 2013 to 2014. Both AAQI and HAQI take into account the combined health effects of various pollutants, and the HAQI considers the exposure (or concentration)-response relationships of pollutants. AAQI and HAQI were compared to AQI to examine the effectiveness of the current AQI in characterizing multi-pollutant air pollution in China. The AAQI and HAQI values are higher than the AQI on days when two or more pollutants simultaneously exceed the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 24-hour Grade II standards. The results of the comparison of the classification of risk categories based on the three indices indicate that the current AQI approach underestimates the severity of health risk associated with exposure to multi-pollutant air pollution. For the AQI-based risk category of 'unhealthy', 96% and 80% of the days would be 'very unhealthy' or 'hazardous' if based on AAQI and HAQI, respectively; and for the AQI-based risk category of 'very unhealthy', 67% and 75% of the days would be 'hazardous' if based on AAQI and HAQI, respectively. The results suggest that the general public, especially sensitive population groups such as children and the elderly, should take more stringent actions than those currently suggested based on the AQI approach during high air pollution events. Sensitivity studies were conducted to examine the assumptions used in the AAQI and HAQI approaches. Results show that AAQI is sensitive to the choice of pollutant irrelevant constant. HAQI is sensitive to the choice of both threshold values and pollutants included in total risk calculation.},

Populations living in Africa, South-East Asia, and in low- and middle-income countries across all regions are the most exposed. Exposure to outdoor air pollution ranks as the ninth leading risk factor for mortality, killing 3.2 million people each year, especially young children, the elderly, persons with lung or cardiovascular disease, those who work or exercise outdoors and low-income populations. In October 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic to humans, calling air pollution 'a major environmental health problem'. Human rights and environmental norms are powerful tools to combat air pollution and its impact on health. The dependence of human rights on environmental quality has been recognised in international texts and by human rights treaty bodies. The growing awareness of the environment has already yielded considerable legislative and regulatory output. However, the implementation of standards remains a pervasive problem. In the fight against violations of norms, citizens have a crucial role to play. We discuss the relevance of a yet to be proclaimed standalone right to a healthy environment.},

The monitoring is based on the recording of environmental parameters like temperature and light intensity as well as micro-level incidents which allows one to infer daily activities like moving, sitting, sleeping, usage of electrical appliances and plumbing components. The prototype is built upon inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware (e.g., various sensors, Arduino microcontrollers, ZigBee-compatible wireless communication modules) and license-free software, thereby ensuring low system deployment costs. The network comprises nodes placed in a house's main rooms or mounted on furniture, one wearable node, one actuator node and a centralized processing element (coordinator). Upon detecting significant deviations from the ordinary activity patterns of individuals and/or sudden falls, the system issues automated alarms which may be forwarded to authorized caregivers via a variety of communication channels. Furthermore, measured environmental parameters and activity incidents may be monitored through standard web interfaces.},

This population is particularly susceptible to multiple morbidities that can be exacerbated by confounding factors like age-related safety risks, polypharmacy, poor nutrition, and social isolation. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to health conditions (heart disease, stroke, and diabetes) that put them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. When an older adult presents to the emergency department with 1 or more of these life-altering diagnoses, an admission to the intensive care unit is often inevitable. Pain is one of the most pervasive manifestations exhibited by intensive care unit patients. There are myriad challenges for critical care nurses in caring for patients experiencing pain-inadequate communication (cognitively impaired or intubated patients), addressing the concerns of family members, or gaps in patients' knowledge. The purpose of this article was to discuss the multidimensional nature of pain and identify concepts innate to pain homeostenosis for elderly patients in the critical care setting. Evidence-based strategies, including an interprofessional team approach and best practice recommendations regarding pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management, are presented.},

Few studies have examined these associations on longer time scales. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were calculated for 1976-2012 for Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China, defining "annual" time periods in 2 ways: from May through April of the following year and from November through October. Annual frequency and severity of extreme temperatures were summarized by using a degree-days approach with extreme heat expressed as annual degree-days >29.3°C and cold as annual degree-days <27.5°C. For example, a day with a mean temperature of 25.0°C contributes 2.5 cold degree-days to the annual total. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the association between annual hot and cold degree-days and the ASMR, with adjustment for long-term trends. Increases of 10 hot or 200 cold degree-days in an annual period, the approximate interquartile ranges for these variables, were significantly (all P's ≤ 0.011) associated with 1.9% or 3.1% increases, respectively, in the annual ASMR for the May-April analyses and with 2.2% or 2.8% increases, respectively, in the November-October analyses. Associations were stronger for noncancer and elderly mortality. Mortality increases associated with extreme temperature are not simply due to short-term forward displacement of deaths that would have occurred anyway within a few weeks.},

    abstract = {Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The "health state" of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.},

Most works in this area use the concept of "activity" as the building block with which to construct applications such as healthcare monitoring or ambient assisted living. The process of identifying a specific activity encompasses the selection of the appropriate set of sensors, the correct preprocessing of their provided raw data and the learning/reasoning using this information. If the selection of the sensors and the data processing methods are wrongly performed, the whole activity detection process may fail, leading to the consequent failure of the whole application. Related to this, the main contributions of this review are the following: first, we propose a classification of the main activities considered in smart home scenarios which are targeted to older people's independent living, as well as their characterization and formalized context representation; second, we perform a classification of sensors and data processing methods that are suitable for the detection of the aforementioned activities. Our aim is to help researchers and developers in these lower-level technical aspects that are nevertheless fundamental for the success of the complete application.},

It is a ubiquitous bacterium that can survive in harsh conditions, such as dry environments, at low temperatures, in brine conditions and at low pH values. It also has the capacity to form biofilms, which makes it particularly successful even in colonizing surfaces within food processing plants. This study analyzed the presence of L. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat food (RTE) such as sausage, cheese, fresh salads, and other types of raw food. 850 samples of refrigerated and packaged food collected in 2008 and 2009 were analyzed. It was found that 25% of these samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes strains. Serotyping and virulence genes detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified that strains belonging to serotype 4b, and containing one or more genes encoded by pathogenicity island (LIPI-1), were significantly associated with specific food types. Furthermore, using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), it was possible to associate isolates from cheese with strains from clinical cases of listeriosis outbreaks that occurred during the same time period within the same geographic regions. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between isolates from frozen seafood and from clinical strains obtained from sporadic cases of listeriosis. In agreement with reports described in other countries, our results shown that Chilean strains of L. monocytogenes from food products include the most virulent serotypes, encoding for the main virulence genes of the LIPI-1, and were clonally related to clinical isolates from sporadic cases and outbreaks of listeriosis. In conclusion, we show that Chilean isolates of L. monocytogenes from RTE and raw food products can cause disease in humans, representing a public health risk that justifies permanent surveillance.},

    abstract = {The pHealth 2015 Conference is the 12th in a series of scientific events bringing together expertise from medical, technological, political, administrative, and social domains, and even from philosophy or linguistics. It opens a new chapter in the success story of the series of international conferences on wearable or implantable micro and nano technologies for personalized medicine by presenting keynotes, invited talks, oral presentations, and short poster presentations provided by close to 100 authors from 20 countries from various parts of the world. Starting in 2003 with personal health management systems, pHealth conferences have evolved to truly interdisciplinary and global events by covering technological and biomedical facilities, legal, ethical, social, and organizational requirements and impacts as well as necessary basic research for enabling future proof care paradigms. Thereby, it combines medical services with public health, prevention, social and elderly care, wellness and personal fitness to establish participatory, predictive, personalized, preventive, and effective care settings. By this way, it has attracted scientists, developers, and practitioners from various technologies, medical and health disciplines, legal affairs, politics, and administration from all over the world. The conference brought together health services vendor and provider institutions, payer organizations, governmental departments, academic institutions, professional bodies, but also patient and citizens representatives. Smart mobile systems such as microsystems, smart textiles, smart implants, sensor-controlled medical devices, and innovative sensor and actuator principles and techniques as well as related body, local and wide area networks up to Cloud services have become important enablers for telemedicine and ubiquitous pervasive health as the next generation health services. Social media and gamification have added even further knowledge to pHealth as an eco-system. OECD has defined four basic areas to be managed in the new care model: address the big data challenges; foster meaningful innovation; understand and address the potential new risks; and support concerted effort to un-silo communities for a virtual care future. The multilateral benefits of pHealth technologies for all stakeholder communities including patients, citizens, health professionals, politicians, healthcare establishments, and companies from the biomedical technology, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications domain gives enormous potential, not only for medical quality improvement and industrial competitiveness, but also for managing health care cost. The pHealth 2015 Conference thankfully benefits from the experience and the lessons learned from the organizing committees of previous pHealth events, particularly 2009 in Oslo, 2010 in Berlin, 2011 in Lyon, 2012 in Porto, 2013 in Tallinn, and 2014 Vienna. The 2009 conference brought up the interesting idea of having special sessions, focusing on a particular topic, and being organized by a mentor/moderator. The Berlin event in 2010 initiated workshops on particular topics prior to the official kick-off of the conference. Lyon in 2011 initiated the launch of socalled dynamic demonstrations allowing the participants to dynamically show software and hardware solutions on the fly without needing a booth. Implementing preconference events, the pHealth 2012 in Porto gave attendees a platform for presenting and discussing recent developments and provocative ideas that helped to animate the sessions. Highlight of pHealth 2013 in Tallinn was the special session on European projects' success stories, but also presentations on the newest paradigm changes and challenges coming up with Big Data, Analytics, Translational and Nano Medicine, etc. Vienna in 2014 focused on lessons learned from international and national R&amp;D activities and practical solutions, and especially from the new EU Framework Program for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020. Beside reports about technology transfer support and building ecosystems and value chains to ensure better time to market and higher impact of knowledge-based technologies, the acceptability of solutions, especially considering security and privacy aspects have been presented and deeply discussed. The pHealth 2015 Conference addresses mobile technologies, knowledge-driven applications and computer-assisted decision support, but also apps designed to support elderly as well as chronic patients in their daily and possibly independent living. Invited contributions consider fundamental scientific and methodological challenges of adaptive, autonomous, and intelligent pHealth approaches, the new role of patients as consumers and active party with growing autonomy and related responsibilities, but also requirements and solutions for mHealth in low- and medium income countries. It aims at sharing experiences and results, and opening up for the future. The pHealth 2015 presentations are complemented by demonstrations of practical artifacts and solutions as well as by a students' poster competition. More insights in the pHealth challenge are provided by a Satellite Conference of NovaMedTech. Embedded Sensor Systems for Health, NovaMedTech, and HL7 Sweden, but - following a long-term tradition - also the Working Groups "Electronic Health Records (EHR)", "Personal Portable Devices (PPD)" and "Security, Safety and Ethics (SSE)" of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) have been actively involved in the preparation and realization of the pHealth 2015 Conference. This proceedings volume covers 3 keynotes and 2 specially invited talks, but also 23 oral presentations selected from more than 50 submissions to the pHealth 2015 conference, and 8 poster presentations. All submissions have been carefully and critically reviewed by at least two independent experts from other than the authors' home countries, and additionally by at least one member of the Scientific Program Committee. The performed highly selective review process resulted in a full papers rejection rate of more than 50%, thereby guaranteeing a high scientific level of the accepted and finally published papers. The editors are indebted to the acknowledged and highly experienced reviewers for having essentially contributed to the quality of the conference and the book at hand. Both the pHealth 2015 Conference and the publication of the pHealth 2015 proceedings at IOS Press would not have been possible without the supporters and sponsors Health Level 7 International (HL7 International), Embedded Sensor Systems for Health, NovaMedTech, and European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI). The editors are also grateful to the dedicated efforts of the Local Organizing Committee members and their supporters for carefully and smoothly preparing and operating the conference. They especially thank all team members from the School of Innovation, Design and Engineering, Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden, for their dedication to the event.

Alterations in sleep architecture that occur as a part of normal aging will contribute to sleep problems as we grow older. Other contributing factors-including comorbid medical conditions, changes in lifestyle and schedule, altered circadian rhythm, among a host of others-can have detrimental effects on the health of the elderly. Coupled with a number of sleep disorders that either emerge or exacerbate with age, the effects of poor sleep often result in an overall worsening of quality of life. Treatment options can be unique in this population and often more difficult due to the effects of normal aging, as well as polypharmacy and possible medication interactions. The following article will focus on the common sleep disorders that can besiege this population, symptoms to aid in diagnosis, and specific treatment options to help improve quality of life in the elderly.},

    abstract = {High levels of major outdoor air pollutants have been documented in Lebanon, but their health effects remain unknown. The Beirut Air Pollution and Health Effects study aimed to determine the relationship between short-term variations in ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and emergency hospital admissions in the city of Beirut, and whether susceptible groups are more greatly affected. An autoregressive Poisson model was used to evaluate the association between daily concentrations of particulate matter and respiratory and cardiovascular emergency hospital admissions after controlling for confounders. All variables were measured during 1 year from January 2012 to December 2012. Relative risks of admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases were calculated for an increase in 10 μg.m(-3) of pollutant concentrations. Total respiratory admissions were significantly associated with the levels of PM10 (1.012 [95% CI 1.004-1.02]) per 10 μg.m(-3) rise in daily mean pollutant concentration for PM10 and 1.016 [95% CI 1.000-1.032] for PM2.5 on the same day. With regard to susceptible groups, total respiratory admissions were associated with PM2.5 and PM10 within the same day in children (relative risk (RR), 1.013 and 1.014; 95% confidence interval, 0.985-1.042 and 1.000-1.029 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively). Moreover, a nearly significant association was found between particles and total circulatory admissions for adults and elderly groups in the same day. These results are similar to other international studies. Therefore, air pollution control is expected to reduce the number of admissions of these diseases in Lebanon.},

    abstract = {Ethylene (ET) is ubiquitous in the environment and is produced both naturally and due to anthropogenic sources. Interestingly, the majority of ambient ET contribution is from natural sources and anthropogenic sources contribute only a minor portion. While microbes and plants naturally produce a large amount of ET, mammals are reported to produce only a small amount of ET endogenously. Anthropogenic sources of ET include the combustion of gas, fuel, coal and biomass. ET is also widely used as an intermediate to make other chemicals and products and is also used for controlled ripening of fruits and vegetables. Although, a review of human and laboratory animal studies indicate ET to be relatively non-toxic, there is concern about the potential toxicity of ET because ET is metabolically converted to ethylene oxide (EtO). EtO has been classified to be carcinogenic to human by the inhalation route by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cancer. ET, however, has been classified as a Group 3 chemical which indicates it is not classified as a human carcinogen by IARC. Several studies have reported ET to cause adverse effects to plant species (vegetation effects) at concentrations that are not adverse to humans. Therefore, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conducted detailed health and welfare (odor and vegetation) based assessments of ET to develop both health and vegetative based toxicity factors in 2008 in accordance with TCEQ guidelines. The health assessment based on well-conducted animal toxicity studies resulted in identification of higher points of departures and subsequently higher effect screening levels (ESLs) that were more than a magnitude higher than the threshold adverse effect level for vegetative effects for ET. Further, based on a weight-of-evidence evaluation of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic mode-of-actions for ET it appears the metabolic conversion of ET to EtO is of insufficient magnitude to cause concern of potential cancer risk. Therefore, the short-term ESL for air permit reviews and air monitoring evaluations is the vegetation-based ESL of 1200 ppb as it is more than a magnitude lower than the health-based acute ESL of 150,000 ppb. Similar to the acute derivation, the chronic evaluation resulted in the derivation of a chronic vegetation based ESL of 30 ppb that was much lower than the chronic ESL of 1600 ppb. In summary, the TCEQ's acute and chronic ESLs for vegetation will protect the general public from short-term and long-term adverse health and welfare effects. The general public includes children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing health conditions.},

    abstract = {In many areas of the world, concentrations of ambient air pollutants exceed levels associated with increased risk of acute and chronic health problems. While effective policies to reduce emissions at their sources are clearly preferable, some evidence supports the effectiveness of individual actions to reduce exposure and health risks. Personal exposure to ambient air pollution can be reduced on high air pollution days by staying indoors, reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air with air filters, and limiting physical exertion, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources. Limited evidence suggests that the use of respirators may be effective in some circumstances. Awareness of air pollution levels is facilitated by a growing number of public air quality alert systems. Avoiding exposure to air pollutants is especially important for susceptible individuals with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, children, and the elderly. Research on mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects of air pollution have suggested potential pharmaceutical or chemopreventive interventions, such as antioxidant or antithrombotic agents, but in the absence of data on health outcomes, no sound recommendations can be made for primary prevention. Health care providers and their patients should carefully consider individual circumstances related to outdoor and indoor air pollutant exposure levels and susceptibility to those air pollutants when deciding on a course of action to reduce personal exposure and health risks from ambient air pollutants. Careful consideration is especially warranted when interventions may have unintended negative consequences, such as when efforts to avoid exposure to air pollutants lead to reduced physical activity or when there is evidence that dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, have potential adverse health effects. These potential complications of partially effective personal interventions to reduce exposure or risk highlight the primary importance of reducing emissions of air pollutants at their sources.},

    abstract = {With fewer newborns and people living longer, older people are making up an increasing fraction of the total population. Epidemiological evidence shows that older-age-related health problems affect a wide and expanding proportion of the world population. One of the major epidemiological trends of this century is the rise of chronic diseases that affect more elderly than younger people. A total of 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 are attributable to outdoor air pollution; the susceptibility to adverse effects of air pollution is expected to differ widely between people and within the same person, and also over time. Frailty history, a measure of multi-system decline, modifies cumulative associations between air pollution and lung function. Moreover, pre-existing diseases may determine susceptibility. In the elderly, due to comorbidity, exposure to air pollutants may even be fatal. Rapid and not-well-planned urbanization is associated with high level of ambient air pollution, mainly caused by vehicular exhausts. In general, there is sufficient evidence of the adverse effects related to short-term exposure, while fewer studies have addressed the longer-term health effects. Increased pollution exposures have been associated with increased mortality, hospital admissions/emergency-room visits, mainly due to exacerbations of chronic diseases or to respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia). These effects may also be modulated by ambient temperature and many studies show that the elderly are mostly vulnerable to heat waves. The association between heat and mortality in the elderly is well-documented, while less is known regarding the associations with hospital admissions. Chronic exposure to elevated levels of air pollution has been related to the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma, and emphysema. There is also growing evidence suggesting adverse effects on lung function related to long-term exposure to ambient air pollution. Few studies have assessed long-term mortality in the elderly. It is still unclear what are the pollutants most damaging to the health of the elderly. It seems that elderly subjects are more vulnerable to particulate matter (PM) than to other pollutants, with particular effect on daily cardio-respiratory mortality and acute hospital admissions. Not many studies have targeted elderly people specifically, as well as specific respiratory morbidity. Most data have shown higher risks in the elderly compared to the rest of the population. Future epidemiological cohort studies need to keep investigating the health effects of air pollutants (mainly cardiopulmonary diseases) on the elderly.},

One main theme: Going around in a circle and two themes: being alone without meaning in life and struggling to achieve reconciliation emerged from the analysis. An important implication for mental healthcare practice is the need to develop a person's ability to shape and take control of her/his life. The healthcare organisation must be committed to a plan that sets out strategies enabling suicidal individuals to avoid the negative experience of meaninglessness. It was concluded that suicidal depressed elderly persons need help to escape from their desperate situation.

Monitoring and managing ADL related to cognitive behaviors for non-medication intervention are very effective in improving dementia patients' conditions.

    abstract = {It is widely taken for granted that the interest in technology decreases with increasing age. Many studies and especially large scale surveys seem to confirm declining technology acceptance; however, it is argued that composition effects (e.g. increasing proportions of women among the older age groups), cohort effects (e.g. experience with different technologies during the lifetime) and various living and health conditions (e.g. living alone, having children in the neighborhood and experience of falls) have to be taken into account and that these factors will have different impacts on the acceptance of different scenarios of assistive technologies. The analyses are based on data from a self-administered questionnaire (n = 2032, a representative random sample of individuals aged 50 years and above in Lower Saxony, Germany). The survey briefly introduced four scenarios of ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies. Multinominal logistic regression was used to explore the correlations of acceptance and the independent variables mentioned. The results show that the simple assumption of an age effect, i.e. technology acceptance generally declines with increasing age, is misleading. An answer to the question whether older people will make use of assistive technologies in the future should consider specific scenarios and also various socioeconomic variables.},

    abstract = {Automatic recognition of human activity is useful as a means of estimating energy expenditure and has potential for use in fall detection and prediction. The emergence of the smartphone as a ubiquitous device presents an opportunity to utilize its embedded sensors, computational power and data connectivity as a platform for continuous health monitoring. In the study described herein, 37 older people (83.9  ±  3.4 years) performed a series of activities of daily living (ADLs) while a smartphone (containing a triaxial accelerometer, triaxial gyroscope and barometric pressure sensor) was placed in the front pocket of their trousers. These results are compared to a similar trial conducted previously in which 20 young people (21.9  ±  1.65 years) were asked to perform the same ADLs using the same smartphone (again in the front pocket of their trousers).In each trial, the participants were asked to perform several activities (standing, sitting, lying, walking on level ground, up and down staircases, and riding an elevator up and down) in a free-living environment. During each acquisition session, the internal sensor signals were recorded and subsequently used to develop activity classifiers based on a decision tree algorithm that classified ADL in epochs of ~1.25 s. When training and testing with the younger cohort, using a leave-one-out cross validation procedure, a total classification sensitivity of 80.9% ± 9.57% ([Formula: see text] = 0.75  ±  0.12) was obtained. Retraining and testing on the older cohort, again using cross validation, gives a comparable total class sensitivity of 82.0% ± 8.88% ([Formula: see text] =0.74  ±  0.12).When trained with the younger group and tested on the older group, a total class sensitivity of 69.2% ± 24.8% (95% confidence interval [69.6%, 70.6%]) and [Formula: see text] = 0.60  ±  0.27 (95% confidence interval [0.58, 0.59]) was obtained. When trained on the older group and tested on the younger group, a total class sensitivity of 80.5% ± 6.80% (95% confidence interval [79.0%, 80.6%]) and [Formula: see text] = 0.74  ±  0.08 (95% confidence interval [0.73, 0.75]) was obtained.An instance of the decision tree classifier developed was implemented on the smartphone as a software application. It was capable of performing real-time activity classification for a period of 17 h on a single battery charge, illustrating that smartphone technology provides a viable platform on which to perform long-term activity monitoring.},

    abstract = {Many societies across the world are confronted with demographic changes, usually related to increased life expectancy and, often, relatively low birth rates. Information and communication technologies (ICT) may contribute to adequately support senior citizens in aging societies with respect to quality of life and quality and efficiency of health care processes. For investigating and for providing answers on whether new information and communication technologies can contribute to keeping, or even improving quality of life, health and self-sufficiency in ageing societies through new ways of living and new forms of care, the Lower Saxony Research Network Design of Environments for Ageing (GAL) had been established as a five years research project, running from 2008 to 2013. Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies in personal and home environments were especially important. In this article we report on the GAL project, and present some of its major outcomes after five years of research. We report on major challenges and lessons learned in running and organizing such a large, inter- and multidisciplinary project and discuss GAL in the context of related research projects. With respect to research outcomes, we have, for example, learned new knowledge about multimodal and speech-based human-machine-interaction mechanisms for persons with functional restrictions, and identified new methods and developed new algorithms for identifying activities of daily life and detecting acute events, particularly falls. A total of 79 apartments of senior citizens had been equipped with specific "GAL technology", providing new insights into the use of sensor data for smart homes. Major challenges we had to face were to deal constructively with GAL's highly inter- and multidisciplinary aspects, with respect to research into GAL's application scenarios, shifting from theory and lab experimentation to field tests, and the complexity of organizing and, in our view, successfully managing such a large project. Overall it can be stated that, from our point of view, the GAL research network has been run successfully and has achieved its major research objectives. Since we now know much more on how and where to use AAL technologies for new environments of living and new forms of care, a future focus for research can now be outlined for systematically planned studies, scientifically exploring the benefits of AAL technologies for senior citizens, in particular with respect to quality of life and the quality and efficiency of health care.},

Among them, 30.3 % had polymicrobial bacteremia and 75.2 % had community-acquired infection. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (62.4 %) and diabetes mellitus (38.5 %). The urinary tract (41.3 %) was the major portal of entry, followed by the hepatobiliary tract (27.5 %), skin and soft tissue (21.1 %), and primary bacteremia (10.1 %). Susceptibility testing of M. morganii isolates showed ubiquitous resistance to first-generation cephalosporins and ampicillin-clavulanate; resistance rates to gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin were 30.3 %, 1.8 %, and 10.1 %, respectively. Overall, the 14-day mortality was 14.7 %. Univariate analysis revealed that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values [p = 0.0137, odds ratio (OR) 5.26], intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p = 0.011, OR 4.4), and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (p < 0.001, OR 1.62) were significantly associated with mortality. The APACHE II score remained the only significant risk factor for mortality in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0012, OR 1.55). In conclusion, M. morganii bacteremia patients were mostly elderly, with one or more comorbidities. Most of the patients had community-acquired infection via the urinary and hepatobiliary tracts. Furthermore, prognosis can be predicted according to disease severity measured by the APACHE II score.},

    abstract = {Due to their detrimental effects on human health, the scientific interest in ultrafine particles (UFP) has been increasing, but available information is far from comprehensive. Compared to the remaining population, the elderly are potentially highly susceptible to the effects of outdoor air pollution. Thus, this study aimed to (1) determine the levels of outdoor pollutants in an urban area with emphasis on UFP concentrations and (2) estimate the respective dose rates of exposure for elderly populations. UFP were continuously measured over 3 weeks at 3 sites in north Portugal: 2 urban (U1 and U2) and 1 rural used as reference (R1). Meteorological parameters and outdoor pollutants including particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were also measured. The dose rates of inhalation exposure to UFP were estimated for three different elderly age categories: 64-70, 71-80, and >81 years. Over the sampling period levels of PM10, O3 and NO2 were in compliance with European legislation. Mean UFP were 1.7 × 10(4) and 1.2 × 10(4) particles/cm(3) at U1 and U2, respectively, whereas at rural site levels were 20-70% lower (mean of 1 ×10(4) particles/cm(3)). Vehicular traffic and local emissions were the predominant identified sources of UFP at urban sites. In addition, results of correlation analysis showed that UFP were meteorologically dependent. Exposure dose rates were 1.2- to 1.4-fold higher at urban than reference sites with the highest levels noted for adults at 71-80 yr, attributed mainly to higher inhalation rates.},

Previous studies have examined the adverse health effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to AAP and outdoor PM on respiratory disease. However, the effect of PM size (PM2.5 and PM10) on cardiovascular disease has not been well studied. Thus, it remains unclear how the size of the inhalable particles (coarse, fine, or ultrafine) affects mortality and morbidity. Airborne PM concentrations are commonly used for ambient air quality management worldwide, owing to the known effects on cardiorespiratory health. In this article, we assess the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and PM, with a particular focus on PM size. We discuss the association of PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and elemental carbon with mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and altered blood pressure, based on epidemiological studies. In addition, we provide evidence that the adverse health effects of AAP and PM are more pronounced among the elderly, children, and people with preexisting cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Finally, we critically summarize the literature pertaining to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and stroke, and introduce potential studies to better understand the health significance of AAP and PM on cardiovascular disease.},

It is important to recognise that patients may not always present in a typical way, features that may indicate depression include anxiety, a preoccupation with somatic symptoms, and a change in function. The presence of understandable triggers and causes should not deter GPs from offering treatment, as long as symptoms are pervasive and continuously persist beyond two weeks. Age-related disabilities and changes to physical health are major risk factors for depression in older people. Vascular diseases, including stroke, MI and diabetes increase the risk of depression, both through direct effects on the brain and the psychological effects. Likewise, dementia is a risk factor for depression. Psychological factors such as loneliness and loss of a valued role, as well as social factors related to retirement, bereavement and reduced independence may also increase the risk. Patients with a previous history of depression and anxiety disorders are at increased risk of depression in later life. Assessment and diagnosis are largely based on a careful history. This should focus on eliciting current features of depression, which have been present for at least two weeks, and are associated with a significant change in function. It is important to exclude organic disorders including anaemia, B12 and folate deficiency, and hypothyroidism that may mimic symptoms of depressive disorder. Referral to specialist mental health services is indicated in the following cases: diagnostic difficulty, poor response to treatment, psychotic symptoms, significant psychiatric comorbidity or a risk of self-neglect or suicide.},

There is a growing trend that these elderly people are placed in an ambient assisted living environment (AAL) with an aim to receive better care and support. In such settings, a lot of attention has been given to continuous health monitoring for maintaining physical health status. However, much less attention has been given toward understanding the entertainment needs of the elderly people, which is an important factor relevant to their mental health and joyful living. This paper thus addresses the entertainment needs of the elderly and proposes a framework of an elderly entertainment support system. The proposed framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people and caregivers) to access various media services in both implicit and explicit manner in order to enhance the quality of their living experience in different contexts. Our experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework. We believe that the proposed approach will establish the need to develop entertainment systems and services for the elderly people and allow us to sensibly address the problems associated with their independent, happy and active living.},

Of recent, it is believed that the chemical composition and physical properties of PM may contribute significantly to these adverse health effects. As part of a Belgian Science Policy project ("Health effects of particulate matter in relation to physical-chemical characteristics and meteorology"), the chemical composition (elemental and ionic compositions) and physical properties (PM mass concentrations) of PM were investigated, indoors and outdoors of old age homes in Antwerp. The case reported here specifically relates to high versus normal/low pollution event periods. PM mass concentrations for PM1 and PM2.5 fractions were determined gravimetrically after collection via impaction. These same samples were hence analysed by EDXRF spectrometry and IC for their elemental and ionic compositions, respectively. During high pollution event days, PM mass concentrations inside the old age home reached 53 μg m(-3) and 32 μg m(-3) whilst outside concentrations were 101 μg m(-3) and 46 μg m(-3) for PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. The sum of nss-sulphate, nitrate and ammonium, dominate the composition of PM, and contribute the most towards an increase in the PM during the episode days constituting 64% of ambient PM2.5 (52 μg m(-3)) compared to 39% on non-episode days (10 μg m(-3)). Other PM components, such as mineral dust, sea salt or heavy metals were found to be considerably higher during PM episodes but relatively less important. Amongst heavy metals Zn and Pb were found at the highest concentrations in both PM2.5 and PM1. Acid-base ionic balance equations were calculated and point to acidic aerosols during event days and acidic to alkaline aerosols during non-event days. No significant sources of indoor pollutants could be identified inside the old-age home as high correlations were found between outdoor and indoor PM, confirming mainly the outdoor origin of indoor air.},

On the BT, the Older group performed less well than the Younger group early on, but as the task progressed, the performance of the Older group caught up and became statistically indistinguishable from that of the Younger group.

We propose the social worlds approach as a promising theoretical lens for dealing with this limitation together with reports from a case study of a mobile information technology innovation in elderly home care in Denmark including both the sociopolitical and organizational levels in the analysis. Using the notions of social worlds, trajectories, and boundary objects enables us to show how mobile information technology innovation in Danish home care can facilitate negotiation and collaboration across different social worlds in one setting while becoming a source of tension and conflicts in others. The trajectory of mobile information technology adoption was shaped by influential stakeholders in the Danish home care sector. Boundary objects across multiple social worlds legitimized the adoption, but the use arrangement afforded by the new technology interfered with important aspects of home care practices, creating resistance among the healthcare personnel.},

However, these studies have typically only examined a handful of risk factors at a time and have sometimes yielded inconsistent results. Method: This study aims to address this gap in the literature by simultaneously examining a range of relevant psychosocial predictors of diurnal cortisol among 54 older adults with a depressive disorder. Salivary cortisol was assessed upon awakening, at 5 PM, and at 9 PM across two consecutive days. Participants also completed measures of global psychosocial stress, current psychiatric symptomatology, pervasive distress (e.g. history of past depression), and protective factors (e.g. social support, resiliency, extent to which one has "made sense" of a significant stressor). Results: High levels of current depressive symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, past depressive episodes, trait anxiety, and poorer ability to make sense of one's stress were found to be associated with flatter (more abnormal) cortisol slopes. However, when all of these variables were entered simultaneously in a multiple regression analysis, only history of past depression and the degree of sense made of stress emerged as unique predictors of cortisol in the model. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for identifying depressed elderly individuals with dysregulated cortisol patterns who may be most at risk for health complications. Treatments that aim to limit the chronicity of depression and help to increase the sense made of stress could potentially have a positive impact on health.},

During the years 1991-2001, the annual elderly population growth rate was 3.39 percent, higher than the annual population growth rate of 2.3 percent. Growing numbers of elderly people are suffering problems in different aspect, but there are limited studies in relation to general morbidities as well as specific in this group of people. The government of Nepal has formulated a National policy, act and regulations on ageing and the problems of elderly; however, this has not been operationalised because of limited resources. In this background of problems that elderly people are facing and government slow initiatives, this paper is illustrated with the objective to explore the different dimensions of ageing and health and health related services for aging people in Nepal using different information for the purpose of further concrete steps in the benefits for elders.},

    abstract = {A probiotic dairy product was developed on the basis of a traditional dish called mutandabota to enable resource-poor populations in southern Africa to benefit from a functional food. Mutandabota is widely consumed in rural southern Africa, making it an ideal food matrix to carry probiotics. First, a process to produce probiotic mutandabota was designed. Raw cow milk was boiled and subsequently cooled to ambient temperature (25°C). Next, dry pulp from the fruit of the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) was added to the milk at a concentration of 4% (wt/vol). This mixture was inoculated with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba and left to ferment for 24h, while the growth of the bacterial culture was monitored. Final ingredients were then added to produce probiotic mutandabota that had 14% (wt/vol) baobab fruit pulp and 7% (wt/vol) sugar in cow milk. The pH of probiotic mutandabota was pH 3.5, which ensures that the product is microbiologically safe. The viable plate count of L. rhamnosus yoba increased from 5.8 ± 0.3 log cfu/mL at the point of inoculation to 8.8 ± 0.4 log cfu/mL at the moment of consumption, thereby meeting the criterion to have a viable count of the probiotic bacterium in excess of 6 log cfu/mL of a product. Baobab fruit pulp at 4% promoted growth of L. rhamnosus yoba with a maximal specific growth rate (μmax) of 0.6 ± 0.2/h at 30°C. The developed technology, though specific for this particular product, has potential to be applied for the delivery of probiotics through a variety of indigenous foods in different regions of the world. Upon consumption, probiotic mutandabota is expected to improve the population's intestinal health, which is especially relevant for vulnerable target groups such as children and elderly people.},

Such conjuncture affects socio-economic structures and creates demands for resourceful solutions, such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), which is a possible methodology to foster health care for elderly people. In this context, sensor-based devices play a leading role in surveying, e.g., health conditions of elderly people, to alert care personnel in case of an incident. However, the adoption of such devices strongly depends on the comfort of wearing the devices. In most cases, the bottleneck is the battery lifetime, which impacts the effectiveness of the system. In this paper we propose an approach to reduce the energy consumption of sensors' by use of local sensors' intelligence. By increasing the intelligence of the sensor node, a substantial decrease in the necessary communication payload can be achieved. The results show a significant potential to preserve energy and decrease the actual size of the sensor device units.},

Specifically, a hierarchical model with spatially varying coefficients is used to account for differences in vulnerability among census block groups. Socio-economic and demographic variables from census and parcel data are selected via a forward selection algorithm where at each step the remaining variables are orthogonalized with respect to the chosen variables to account for collinearity. Daily minimum temperatures and composite heat indices (e.g. discomfort index) provide a better model fit than other ambient temperature measurements (e.g. maximum temperature, relative humidity). Positive interactions between elderly populations and heat exposure were found suggesting these populations are more responsive to increases in heat.},

The mitochondrial life cycle, comprising biogenesis, fusion/fission events and mitophagic elimination, is carefully orchestrated, and age-related decay of the lifecycle contributes to chronic degenerative diseases. Mitochondria make contacts with other cellular organelles in the endomembrane system (endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes and lysosomes) whose dynamics are co-regulated and interactions finely tuned to meet the cell requirements and maintain the health of the organism. This review will consider the evidence that mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control, as well as the complex interplay among cellular organelles, may be affected by the aging process(es), with negative consequences for the well being of elderly individuals. Moreover, we propose that nutrients or drugs able to maintain organelle homeostasis may represent novel preventive and/or therapeutic approaches for chronic age-related diseases.},

To achieve this, we conducted a literature survey of state-of-the-art AAL frameworks, systems and platforms to identify the essential aspects of AAL systems and investigate the critical issues from the design, technology, quality-of-service, and user experience perspectives. In addition, we conducted an email-based survey for collecting usage data and current status of contemporary AAL systems. We found that most AAL systems are confined to a limited set of features ignoring many of the essential AAL system aspects. Standards and technologies are used in a limited and isolated manner, while quality attributes are often addressed insufficiently. In conclusion, we found that more inter-organizational collaboration, user-centered studies, increased standardization efforts, and a focus on open systems is needed to achieve more interoperable and synergetic AAL solutions.},

The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of climate change and consequent increases in environmental heat stress on the aging cardiovascular system. The earth's average global temperature is slowly but consistently increasing, and along with mean temperature changes come increases in heat wave frequency and severity. Extreme passive thermal stress resulting from prolonged elevations in ambient temperature and prolonged physical activity in hot environments creates a high demand on the left ventricle to pump blood to the skin to dissipate heat. Even healthy aging is accompanied by altered cardiovascular function, which limits the extent to which older individuals can maintain stroke volume, increase cardiac output, and increase skin blood flow when exposed to environmental extremes. In the elderly, the increased cardiovascular demand during heat waves is often fatal because of increased strain on an already compromised left ventricle. Not surprisingly, excess deaths during heat waves 1) occur predominantly in older individuals and 2) are overwhelmingly cardiovascular in origin. Increasing frequency and severity of heat waves coupled with a rapidly growing at-risk population dramatically increase the extent of future untoward health outcomes.},

These data are collected from physiological sensors (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, glucose) and environmental sensors (e.g., motion, bed/chair occupancy, electrical usage). The system can also give alarms if sudden problems occur, like a fall, and warnings based on more long-term trends, such as the deterioration of health being detected. It has been implemented and tested in a test environment and has been deployed in six real homes for a year-long evaluation. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of an implemented system for ambient assisted living (AAL) tested in a real environment, combining the acquisition of sensor data, a flexible and adaptable middleware compliant with the OSGistandard and a context recognition application.

    abstract = {Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous opportunities for the implementation of ubiquitous health care systems in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against abnormal conditions. This helps with the automatic and remote monitoring/tracking of patients in hospitals and facilitates and with the supervision of fragile, elderly people in their own domestic environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug delivery. This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for the multipatient positioning in a wireless body area network (WBAN) which exploits the spatial sparsity of patients and a sparse fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based feature extraction mechanism for monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a central database server containing patient vital information. The main goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and resolution in the patient localization with less computational complexity in the implementation using the compressive sensing theory. We represent the patients' positions as a sparse vector obtained by the discrete segmentation of the patient movement space in a circular grid. To estimate this vector, a compressive-sampling-based two-level FFT (CS-2FFT) feature vector is synthesized for each received signal from the biosensors embedded on the patient's body at each grid point. This feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both short-time and long-time properties of the received signals. The robustness of the proposed CS-2FFT-based algorithm in terms of the average positioning error is numerically evaluated using the realistic parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6-WBAN standard in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the circular grid pattern and the CS-2FFT feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a significant reduction in the computational complexity, while improving the level of the resolution and the localization accuracy when compared to some classical CS-based positioning algorithms.},

Evidence suggests that 1 out of 10 older adults experiences some form of elder abuse, and only a fraction of cases are actually reported to social services agencies. At the same time, elder abuse is independently associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality. Despite these findings, there is a great paucity in research, practice, and policy dealing with this pervasive issue. In this paper, I review the epidemiology of elder abuse as well as key practical issues in dealing with the cases of elder abuse. Through my experiences as a Congressional Policy Fellow/National Health and Aging Policy Fellow, I highlight key previsions on 2 major federal legislations dealing with the issues of elder abuse: Older Americans Act (OAA) and Elder Justice Act (EJA). Lastly, I highlight major research gaps and future policy relevant research directions to advance the field of elder abuse. Interdisciplinary and community-based efforts are needed to devise effective strategies to detect, treat, and prevent elder abuse in our increasingly diverse aging populations. Collective advocacy and policy advances are needed to create a national infrastructure to protect the vulnerable older adults.},

Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users.

Results show that 12 weeks of video game-based exercise program training improved the braking force in the normal step condition, along with the functional fitness of lower limb strength, cardiovascular endurance, and motor agility, as measured by the Senior Fitness Test. Only the global mental dimension of the SF-36 was sensitive to exergame practice. Exergames appear to be an effective way to train postural control in older adults. Because of the multimodal nature of the activity, exergames provide an effective tool for remediation of age-related problems.},

    abstract = {The growing number of elderly individuals presents new challenges for society. Many elderly individuals have physical or cognitive impairments and require support from caregivers. An attempt to overcome the limitations caused by the lack of human caregivers is the inclusion of assistive technology such as socially active robots. The Domeo-project of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme of the European Union aims to develop a new companion robotic system that would allow assistance to the elderly. The requirements and attitude of the potential users and caregivers have been assessed in Austria, France and Hungary. The robot functions were demonstrated to the participants. Three focus groups were formed: potential end users, older caregivers and younger caregivers. The discussions were recorded and processed according to six aspects: (i) acceptability and privacy, (ii) pertinence of services, (iii) possible obstacles, (iv) motivation level to use the proposed services, (v) organizational issues and (vi) recommendations. Minor differences were observed between the countries, but there were considerable differences regarding the age of the participants. The younger caregivers want to be assured of the safety of their client and to receive immediate notification in case of an emergency. As for the elderly, the most important aspect is to gain a companion and a physical helper. Many of the recommendations can be taken into consideration during robot development, but some of them are not realistic at present.},

Enabling everyone to have access and capability to use the Internet and associated digital technologies, summed up in the term 'digital inclusion', is seen to have wide-ranging benefits to the individual, to the economy and to society. For older people, being digitally included can help them to maintain their independence, social connectedness and sense of worth in the face of declining health or limited capabilities, as well as also offering new opportunities to improve their quality of life. At present however, access to the technology and to the benefits is not equally distributed either between or within nations, and older people tend to be on the 'wrong' side of what is termed the 'digital divide'. Governments globally are developing strategies to promote digital inclusion and indeed Internet uptake is increasing steadily, including amongst older people. However, such strategies have focussed on getting people online, and there appears to be an assumption that once someone is online they will remain 'digitally engaged'. In fact statistics show that some users give up using the Internet, and there is emerging evidence that older people are more vulnerable to the factors which can lead to this outcome. The authors see this phenomenon as a potential but largely unrecognised 'fourth digital divide' which has serious implications for social inclusion. The objectives of this article are (a) to raise awareness of the phenomenon of digital disengagement by considering some of the emerging evidence, (b) to explore some of the potential implications of not recognising and therefore not addressing the needs of the digitally disengaged older population, and (c) to reveal the prevailing gap in knowledge which future research should address.},

This means that game players do not have to engage their cognitive empathy when playing games. Thus, prolonged use of video games during adolescence can result in the underdevelopment of cognitive empathy. This survey from three age groups (adolescents aged 16-19, adults aged 37-41, elders aged 58-62) demonstrated that only among adolescents was the amount of time spent in game play negatively associated with cognitive empathy. The findings of this study can contribute to understanding the nature of video game play and its negative effects by focusing on the manner of media use rather than the messages in media, and focusing on cognitive empathy, which has rarely been examined.},

    abstract = {Japan is still "intermediate burden" country as medium-incidence of tuberculosis (TB). But the incidence of TB varies by public health units. The priority for TB control would be lowering in the areas where the incidence of TB is relatively low. In addition, younger age groups get low prevalence of TB infection than elderly persons. As a result, fewer experiences for TB diagnosis and treatment in the hospital and the medical facility would cause the delay in the detection of TB patients which eventually cause outbreaks. Although there are differences in population density and population mobility between urban and rural areas, the socially economic vulnerable patients and foreign patients are the common risks. Any public health units' policies of TB should correspond to the individual situation. At the era of low tuberculosis incidence, the infection risk is to be "From ubiquitous to the uneven distribution". This makes TB detection much more difficult. At this symposium, each speaker presented the case for actually experienced with QFT test and/or VNTR analysis. They mainly focused on the paradigm shift in TB control which is indispensable for resolving the gaps in regional differences and the differences in diagnostic capability. Although the cases in this symposium were not for the low incidence situation, the pioneering approaches presented here would boost the future application of QFT and VNTR analysis nationwide. The discussions also partially covered the technical infrastructure for molecular epidemiology which covers the whole country. By making full use of QFT test and VNTR analysis as a contact screening tool, we can appropriately understand the risk of TB infection in the region from a buildup of bacteria and patient information. Now is the time to prepare for. Active surveillance of TB by this way would clarify the risk of the disease and lead to the advocacy essential for the resolution. 1. Current situation and challenge of contact survey by using QFT test in Tokyo: Hideo MAEDA (Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Government). 2. Contact investigation of a tuberculosis outbreak: Kenichi MIYAMOTO (Takaido Community Health Center). We have experienced a TB outbreak in integrated junior and senior high school in Tokyo. Index patient was a student with persistent respiratory symptoms for six months before diagnosis of sputum smear-positive TB. Public health center started contact investigation immediately. QFT-positive rates were high in close contacts, especially in classmates. Additionally, a student outside of contact investigation was diagnosed as TB and considered to be infected from the first patient by VNTR analysis. Therefore, public health center expanded QFT-tests to all students and teachers in this school. Finally, 9 students and 2 teachers in this school were diagnosed as sputum smear-negative TB by contact investigation. 3. Utilization of molecular epidemiological procedure in contact investigation in Kyoto City: Masahiro ITO (Public Health Center of Kyoto City) Molecular epidemiological procedure using VNTR analysis has been used for contact investigation of tuberculosis since January 2011 in Kyoto City. One hundred forty four strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients with tuberculosis were investigated and 130 strains were fully analyzed. Fourteen clusters were found and the number of strains included in the cluster was ranged from two to 11. Epidemiological relationship between patients in one cluster was found, however, significant relationship in another clusters was not demonstrated. It was suggested that VNTR analysis is useful for molecular epidemiological analysis of tuberculosis. 4. The population based molecular epidemiological studies and QFT test in a contact examination: Riyo FUJIYAMA, Keisuke MATSUBAYASHI, Setsuko MIZUSHIRI, Junko HIGUCHIL Chika SHIRAI, Yuko KATAGAMI, Mieko CHIHARA, Akihiro IJICHI (Kobe City Public Health Center), Kentaro ARIKAWA, Noriko NAKANISHI, Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health). The population based molecular epidemiological studies should be made good use of contacts examination. In future, we expect the tuberculosis molecular epdimiological study improve search for the process of tuberculosis infection. The QFT positive rates correlated well with closeness of contact. QFT test is considered useful for diagnosing tuberculosis infection. However, in the judgment of tuberculosis infection, we should consider the total result of contact investigation not only QFT test but also the contact situation. 5. Insights into the TB epidemiology through population based molecular epidemiological studies: Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health) The population based molecular epidemiological studies unveiled the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis at bacterial clone level. This provides scientific evidences for achieving better TB control programs. In the advanced stage of the tuberculosis molecular epidemiological study, we expect to change the current geno-typing based molecular epidemiology to whole genome-typing based molecular epidemiology on the basis of the rapid innovation of next-generation sequencing technology.},

In particular, challenges in WBAN and ubiquitous computing were emphasized. The purpose of this survey is not only to help beginners with a holistic approach toward understanding u-Health systems but also present to researchers new technological trends and design challenges they have to cope with, while designing such systems.},

    abstract = {Elderly individuals are more susceptible to excess summer heat. We sought to examine whether the use of cooling systems (air-conditioning or fan) affected the clinical outcomes of elderly febrile patients. We prospectively followed elderly (≥ 75 years old) febrile patients requesting the medical services of the SOS Doctors (a network of physicians performing house-call visits) from July 10 to August 20, 2011. Patients who used cooling systems ("users") were compared with those who did not ("non-users") regarding mortality, clinical outcome of primary illness (improvement or deterioration), and emergency hospitalization. Prospectively collected data were available for 339 individual elderly febrile patients. "Users" had lower mortality (10 % vs. 19 %, p < 0.05) than "non-users"; no difference was noted on clinical improvement (85 % vs. 76 %, p = 0.11) and emergency hospitalization rates (21 % vs. 30 %, p = 0.16). No difference was noted between users of air-conditioning and fan regarding mortality or clinical improvement, but fan use was associated with more hospitalizations (37 % vs. 19 %, p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis (assessing daily ambient temperature, use of cooling systems, patient age, and living conditions), the sole variable significantly associated with mortality was the non-use of cooling systems [odds ratio (OR): 2.18, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.06-4.50]. The use of air-conditioning or fan during hot summer periods appeared to be beneficial for elderly febrile patients living in a large city. Large prospective studies are warranted in order to provide further insight into potential individual and public health initiatives aiming to alleviate the impact of excess summer heat on the health of elderly patients.},

The iFit platform develops a means of testing Bureau of Health Promotion mandated health assessment items for the elderly (including flexibility tests, grip strength tests, balance tests, and reaction time tests) and integrates wireless remote sensors in a game-like environment to capture and store subject response data, thus providing individuals in elderly care contexts with a greater awareness of their own physical condition. In this study, we specifically evaluated the users' intention of using the iFit using a technology acceptance model (TAM). A total of 101 elderly subjects (27 males and 74 females) were recruited. A survey was conducted to measure technology acceptance, to verify that the platform could be used as intended to promote fitness among the elderly. Results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and usage attitude positively impact behavioral intention to use the platform. The iFit platform can offer user-friendly solutions for a community-based fitness care and monitoring of elderly subjects. In summary, iFit was determined by three key drivers and discussed as follows: risk factors among the frail elderly, mechanism for slowing the advance frailty, and technology acceptance and support for promoting physical fitness.},

Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors.},

Maximal aerobic power, walking speed and habitual physical activity are 10-30% greater in men than in women. This reflects not only biological but also socio-cultural and environmental factors, with the latter becoming dominant as age advances. It implies a need for sex-specific thresholds of moderate activity. Overall health is associated with both the year-averaged daily step count (the best indicator in women) and the year-averaged daily duration of physical activity >3 metabolic equivalents (METs) (the best indicator in men). In both sexes, the threshold ranges of step count and/or duration of activity >3 METs associated with a reduced prevalence of health problems are: 4000-5000 steps/day and/or 5-7.5 min/day for impaired mental and psychosocial health, such as a depressed mood state and a poor health-related quality of life; 7000-8000 steps/day and/or 15-20 min/day for markers of aortic arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia and poor physical fitness; and 8000-10,000 steps/day and/or 20-30 min/day for components of the metabolic syndrome, especially hypertension and hyperglycemia. Irrespective of sex, both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by stressful life events, such as a partner's death, and immediate meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature, underlining the need for long-term measurement of activity patterns. These findings have practical implications for those who engage in epidemiological studies and/or design health promotional programs for the elderly.},

This paper aims to examine catastrophic and poverty impacts of household out-of-pocket health expenditure in Viet Nam over time and identify socio-economic indicators associated with them. Data used in this research were obtained from a nationally representative household survey, Viet Nam Living Standard Survey 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The findings revealed that there were problems in health care financing in Viet Nam - many households encountered catastrophic health expenditure and/or were pushed into poverty due to health care payments. The issues were pervasive over time. Catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment problems were more common among the households who had more elderly people and those located in rural areas. Importantly, the financial protection aspect of the national health insurance schemes was still modest. Given these findings, more attention is needed on developing methods of financial protection in Viet Nam.},

These includes not only disorders that directly impact dopamine and basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disorder, but also degeneration in which multiple neural pathways are affected over the course of normal aging. The impact of such deficits can be dramatic, as in cases of financial fraud, which disproportionately affect the elderly. Unlike memory and motor impairments, however, which are readily recognized as symptoms of more serious underlying neurological conditions, social and decision-making deficits often do not elicit comparable concern in the elderly. Furthermore, few behavioral measures exist to quantify these deficits, due in part to our limited knowledge of the core cognitive components or their neurobiological substrates. Here we probe age-related differences in decision-making using a game theory paradigm previously shown to dissociate contributions of basal ganglia and prefrontal regions to behavior. Combined with computational modeling, we provide evidence that age-related changes in elderly participants are driven primarily by an over-reliance in trial-and-error reinforcement learning that does not take into account the strategic context, which may underlie cognitive deficits that contribute to social vulnerability in elderly individuals.},

Most studies of hypertension exclude octogenarians and are not able to be generalized because of differences in physiologic and social phenomena. This review evaluates the existing literature in an effort to identify unresolved issues and guide future areas of investigation. Hypertension has been well characterized in adults and the young elderly, and the focus is on optimizing treatment regimens. However, research specifically involving this rapidly growing minority is sparse. Most studies are still trying to characterize blood pressure goals, and only one major series has begun to evaluate treatment options. Based on available evidence, it appears that an appropriate blood pressure goal may be somewhat higher in octogenarians and that thiazide diuretics may be the initial treatment of choice.},

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of PM(10) on the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative stress biomarker, and the effect modification by genetic polymorphisms of eNOS, oxidative stress-related gene, in the 560 Korean elderly. We obtained urine samples repeatedly from participants during five medical examinations between 2008 and 2010 and all ambient air pollutant concentration data from the Korea National Institute of Environmental Research air quality monitoring system. We measured urinary levels of MDA to assess oxidative stress and genotyped eNOS (rs1799983, rs2853796, and rs7830). Mixed-effect model was used to estimate the effect of PM(10) on the level of oxidative stress biomarker and their modification by genotypes. PM(10) showed apparent positive effect on MDA level after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, cotinine level, temperature, dew point, levels of SO(2), O(3), NO(2), and CO, and season (p=0.0133). Moreover, the association of PM(10) with MDA was found only in participants with eNOS GG genotype for rs1799983 (p=0.0107), TT genotype for rs2853796 (p=0.0289), or GT genotype for rs7830 (p=0.0158) and in participants with a set of risky haplotypes (GTT, GTG, GGT, and TGT) (p=0.0093). Our results suggest that PM(10) affect oxidative stress in the elderly and eNOS genotype affect the oxidative stress level in regard of exposure to PM(10).},

Furthermore, effects in the lungs, e.g. inflammatory effects, have not been substantiated at indoor relevant concentrations. Some VOCs, including formaldehyde, in combination may under certain environmental and occupational conditions result in reported sensory irritation. The odour thresholds of several VOCs are low enough to influence the perceived air quality that result in a number of acute effects from reported sensory irritation in eyes and airways and deterioration of performance. The odour perception (air quality) depends on a number of factors that may influence the odour impact. There is neither clear indication that office dust particles may cause sensory effects, even not particles spiked with glucans, aldehydes or phthalates, nor lung effects; some inflammatory effects may be observed among asthmatics. Ozone-initiated terpene reaction products may be of concern in ozone-enriched environments (≥0.1mg/m(3)) and elevated limonene concentrations, partly due to the production of formaldehyde. Ambient particles may cause cardio-pulmonary effects, especially in susceptible people (e.g. elderly and sick people); even, short-term effects, e.g. from traffic emission and candle smoke may possibly have modulating and delayed effects on the heart, but otherwise adverse effects in the airways and lung functions have not been observed. Secondary organic aerosols generated in indoor ozone-initiated terpene reactions appear not to cause adverse effects in the airways; rather the gaseous products are relevant. Combined exposure to particles and ozone may evoke effects in subgroups of asthmatics. Based on an analysis of thresholds for odour and sensory irritation selected compounds are recommended for measurements to assess the indoor air quality and to minimize reports of irritation symptoms, deteriorated performance, and cardiovascular and pulmonary effects.},

The target group contained persons 70+ years of age living in assisted living conditions (N=34). The average age of the participants was 85.9 years. Women (n=17) and men (n=17) were equally presented in the sample group. Only 12 % (n=4) of participants were involved in an active weekly-based rehabilitation, light physical sitting exercises 38% (n=13). Three (n=3) of the participants (9%) used computers (net banking), and 20 (59%) used mobile phones on daily basis. Social activities and physical activation seem to be rather inadequate and traditional in assisted living organizations. The overall experiences of mobile controlled game described in this paper appeared to be a successful experiment also proving that the elderly are not as reluctant to use technical devices or playing virtual games as often thought. The game was reckoned very motivating, interesting, and entertaining both by the aged and the staff. Activation, rehabilitation and recreation in the elderly homes or assisted living organizations could benefit from utilization of new technology providing new ways and solutions that motivate the users and offer also possibilities for measuring and follow-up of the physical impacts. The future goals to improve the game were set according to the feedback given in this survey: a) wider variety of controlling modes for the game, b) developing various difficulty levels, c) developing the game to support different kinds of body movements, d) easily modified according to the individual user's exercising or rehabilitation needs as well as e) emphasizing the social aspects of the game by producing multiplayer versions.},

During the first 2-3 years of life, much of the disease burden may be attributed to infection with enteric pathogens including Salmonella, rotavirus, and many other bacterial, viral, and protozoan organisms; however, infections due to Clostridium difficile exhibit steady increases with age. Still others, like Campylobacter infections in industrialized settings are high in early life (<2 years old) and increase again in early adulthood (called the "second weaning" by some). The reasons for these differences undoubtedly reside in part in pathogen differences; however, host factors including the commensal intestinal microbial communities, immune responses (innate and acquired), and age-dependant shifts likely play important roles. Interplay of these factors is illustrated by studies examining changes in human gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Recent gut microbial surveys have indicated dramatic shifts in gut microbial population structure from infants to young adults to the elders. An understanding of the evolution of these factors and their interactions (e.g., how does gut microbiota modulate the "inflamm-aging" process or vice versa) through the human life "cycle" will be important in better addressing and controlling these enteric infections and their consequences for both quality and quantity of life (often assessed as disability adjusted life-years or "DALYs").},

Unpublished data included in this review paper demonstrate that more intense physical activity associated with high-altitude training or mountaineering does not increase prevalence or severity of AMS at these altitudes. These conclusions can also be extended to the use of normobaric hypoxia, as data in this paper suggest that the severity of AMS is not significantly different between hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia at the same ambient pO(2). Furthermore, high-altitude cerebral or pulmonary oedema do not occur at these altitudes and intermittent exposure to considerably higher altitudes (4000-6000 m) used by athletes for hypoxic training are too short to cause acute high-altitude illnesses. Even moderate altitude between 2000 and 3000 m can, however, exacerbate cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or lead to a first manifestation of undiagnosed illness in older people that may belong to the accompanying staff of athletes. Moderate altitudes may also lead to splenic infarctions in healthy athletes with sickle cell trait.},

Participants could spend points to get vaccinated and reduce the risk of influenza. When players were paid according to individual point totals, more elderly than young players got vaccinated, a finding consistent with the Nash equilibrium predicting self-interested behavior. When players were paid according to group point totals, however, more young than elderly players got vaccinated-a finding consistent with the utilitarian equilibrium predicting group-optimal behavior-which resulted in higher point totals than when players were paid for their individual totals. Thus, payout structure affected whether individuals got vaccinated for self-interest or group benefit.},

In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a human caregiver to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt human caregiver depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the human caregiver but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregivers acceptance and their engagement.},

More than 76.8% of the trekkers involved in alpine accidents in Japan were older than 40 years, with some experiencing a stroke or myocardial infarction while trekking at altitude. In the present study, we surveyed social trends in trekkers by interview at a popular mountain site, Mt Tanigawa (1963 m in altitude). The total number of trekkers interviewed was 511, and more than 60% of these were older than 40 years. Of trekkers older than 60 years, 42% complained of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. In 2 volunteer groups (10 younger subjects and 10 older subjects), physical condition was assessed before and after trekking. Significant body weight loss induced by dehydration was observed more often in older subjects than in younger subjects (P < .05). Balance, as measured using the Nintendo WiiFit (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan), worsened in the older group (P < .05). Local police records for 2009 showed that the total number of alpine accidents was 65. Injuries provoked by stumbling, slipping, and falling accounted for 51% of these, and 82% of casualties were older than 40 years, with 35% being older than 60 years. In conclusion, many older people involved in nonchallenging middle-altitude trekking have problems with regard to overall health and balance. Alpine accidents caused by myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypoglycemia tend to be more common in this population. Alpine rescue teams should be well prepared for this, and older trekkers should be made aware of their increased risk of injury in alpine settings.},

In the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), we investigated the short-term association between NO(2) and mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for NO(2). In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. We combined the individual-city estimates of the concentration-response curves to get an overall NO(2)-mortality association in China. The averaged daily concentrations of NO(2) in the 17 Chinese cities ranged from 26 μg/m(3) to 67 μg/m(3). In the combined analysis, a 10-μg/m(3) increase in two-day moving averaged NO(2) was associated with a 1.63% [95% posterior interval (PI), 1.09 to 2.17], 1.80% (95% PI, 1.00 to 2.59) and 2.52% (95% PI, 1.44 to 3.59) increase of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for ambient particles or sulfur dioxide (SO(2)). Older people appeared to be more vulnerable to NO(2) exposure. The combined concentration-response curves indicated a linear association. Conclusively, this largest epidemiologic study of NO(2) in Asian developing countries to date suggests that short-term exposure to NO(2) is associated with increased mortality risk.},

Now the country is experiencing an epidemiological transition characterised by a baby boom, youth bulge and increasing longevity. Common wisdom would therefore suggest that Omanis will suffer less ill health. However, a survey of literature suggests that chronic non-communicable diseases are unexpectedly becoming common. This is possibly fuelled by some socio-cultural patterns specific to Oman, as well as the shortcomings of the 'miracle' of health and rapid modernisation. Unfortunately, such new diseases do not spare younger people; a proportion of them will need the type of care usually reserved for the elderly. In addition, due to their pervasive and refractory nature, these chronic non-communicable diseases seem impervious to the prevailing 'cure-oriented' health care system. This situation therefore calls for a paradigm shift: a health care system that goes beyond a traditional cure-orientation to provide care services for the chronically sick of all ages.},

This adverse health effect is suggested to be mediated by inflammatory processes. The purpose of this study was to determine if low levels of particulate matter, typical for smaller cities, are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Fifty-two elderly individuals with ischemic heart disease were followed for six months with biweekly clinical visits in the city of Kotka, Finland. Blood samples were collected for the determination of inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon (IFN)γ, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, myeloperoxidase and white blood cell count. Particle number concentration and fine particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 μm (PM(2.5))) as well as thoracic particle (particles with aerodynamic diameters <10 μm (PM(10))) mass concentration were measured daily at a fixed outdoor measurement site. Light-absorbance of PM(2.5) filter samples, an indicator of combustion derived particles, was measured with a smoke-stain reflectometer. In addition, personal exposure to PM(2.5) was measured with portable photometers. During the study period, wildfires in Eastern Europe led to a 12-day air pollution episode, which was excluded from the main analyses. Average ambient PM(2.5) concentration was 8.7 μg/m(3). Of the studied pollutants, PM(2.5) and absorbance were most strongly associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers; most notably with C-reactive protein and IL-12 within a few days of exposure. There was also some evidence of an effect of particulate air pollution on fibrinogen and myeloperoxidase. The concentration of IL-12 was considerably (227%) higher during than before the forest fire episode. These findings show that even low levels of particulate air pollution from urban sources are associated with acute systemic inflammation. Also particles from wildfires may exhibit pro-inflammatory effects.},

In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer-reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user-game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user-game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

    abstract = {The effects of air pollution on health have been studied worldwide. Given that air pollution triggers oxidative stress and inflammation, it is plausible that high levels of air pollutants cause higher number of hospitalisations. This study aimed to assess the impact of air pollution on the emergency hospitalisation for respiratory disease in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study was divided in two parts: Part I specifically addressing the air pollution assessment and Part II addressing the health assessment. Accordingly, this Part II aimed to estimate the association between the concentrations of PM₁₀, SO₂ and CO observed in Rio de Janeiro and the number of emergency hospitalisations at a central hospital due to respiratory diseases. The pollutant concentrations were measured at two different sites in Rio de Janeiro, but the excess relative risks were calculated based on the concentrations observed at one of the sites, where limits were generally exceeded more frequently, between September 2000 and December 2005. A time series analysis was performed using the number of hospitalisations, divided in three categories (children until 1 year old, children aged between 1 and 5 years old and elderly with 65 years old or more) as independent variable, the concentrations of pollutants as dependent variables and temperature, relative humidity, long term trend, and seasonality as confounders. Data were analysed using generalised additive models with smoothing for some of the dependent variables. Results showed an excess risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disease higher than 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in PM₁₀ concentrations for children under 5 years old, of 2% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in SO₂ for elderly above 65 years old and around 0.1% per 10 μg m⁻³ increase in CO for children under 1 year and elderly. Other studies have found associations that are in agreement with the results achieved in this study. The study suggests that the ambient levels of air pollutants experienced in Rio de Janeiro between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the number of hospitalisations for respiratory diseases among children and elderly.},

We repeatedly measured SBP and DBP during supine rest and 1 and 3 minutes after standing among 747 elderly (aged 78.3±5.3 years, mean±SD) participants from a prospective cohort study. We used linear mixed models to assess the association between change in SBP (ΔSBP=standing SBP-supine SBP) and DBP (ΔDBP) on standing and mean PM(2.5) levels over the preceding 1 to 28 days, adjusting for meteorologic covariates, temporal trends, and medical history. We observed a 1.4-mm Hg (95% CI: 0.0-2.8 mm Hg; P=0.046) higher ΔSBP and a 0.7-mm Hg (95% CI: 0.0-1.4 mm Hg; P=0.053) higher ΔDBP at 1 minute of standing per interquartile range increase (3.8 μg/m(3)) in mean PM(2.5) levels in the past 7 days. ΔSBP and ΔDBP measured 3 minutes after standing were not associated with PM(2.5). Resting DBP (but not SBP or pulse pressure) was positively associated with PM(2.5) at longer averaging periods. Responses were more strongly associated with black carbon than sulfate levels. These associations did not differ significantly according to hypertension status, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or sex. These results suggest that ambient particles can increase resting DBP and exaggerate blood pressure responses to postural changes in elderly people. Increased vasoreactivity during posture change may be responsible, in part, for the adverse effect of ambient particles on cardiovascular health.},

Recent advances in motion-sensor technology have enabled wearable sensors to be used efficiently for pervasive care of the elderly. In addition to fall detection, it is also important to determine the direction of a fall, which could help in the location of joint weakness or post-fall fracture. This work uses a waist-worn sensor, encompassing a 3D accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, for reliable fall detection and the determination of the direction of a fall. Also assessed is an efficient analysis framework suitable for on-node implementation using a low-power micro-controller that involves both feature extraction and fall detection.

The 18-item MKT was structured according to the dimensions of the self-regulation model (SRM) to measure the accuracy of students' beliefs about malaria. An experimental design was used to compare three game versions. Students (N=482) participated in 2010 by completing a pre-test, playing a Web-based game simulating student travel to malaria-endemic destinations, and completing a post-test. Study data support the validity and reliability of the MKT for the evaluation of malaria education interventions and for student self-assessment. Use of the MKT to evaluate an educational game about malaria revealed a strong overall learning effect and discrimination by game version, travel experience, and SRM dimension. This 5-min test may also be adapted for educational outreach purposes among health care providers globally, residents of malaria-endemic regions, and other high risk travel groups (e.g., elderly, chronic health conditions, pregnant, or returning to malaria-endemic regions to visit friends/relatives).},

Thematic analysis was conducted exploring barriers, strategies and resources as they relate to health literacy in older adults. Three main themes were identified: literacy barriers, aging process and social resources. Problems associated with health literacy in this population were pervasive. Numeracy, a component of health literacy, was a central factor for a range of medication management problems.

    abstract = {The vitamin folate functions within the cell as a carrier of one-carbon units. The requirement for one-carbon transfers is ubiquitous and all mammalian cells carry out folate dependent reactions. In recent years, low folate status has been linked to risk of numerous adverse health conditions throughout life from birth defects and complications of pregnancy to cardiovascular disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. In many instances inadequate intake of folate seems to be the primary contributor but there is also evidence that an underlying genetic susceptibility can play a modest role by causing subtle alterations in the availability, metabolism or distribution of intermediates in folate related pathways. Folate linked one-carbon units are essential for DNA synthesis and repair and as a source of methyl groups for biological methylation reactions. The notion of common genetic variants being linked to risk of disease was relatively novel in 1995 when the first functional folate-related polymorphism was discovered. Numerous polymorphisms have now been identified in folate related genes and have been tested for functionality either as a modifier of folate status or as being associated with risk of disease. Moreover, there is increasing research into the importance of folate-derived one-carbon units for DNA and histone methylation reactions, which exert crucial epigenetic control over cellular protein synthesis. It is thus becoming clear that genetic aspects of folate metabolism are wide-ranging and may touch on events as disparate as prenatal imprinting to cancer susceptibility. This chapter will review the current knowledge in this area.},

Participants completed a survey that included an illness management inventory, self-rated health and sense of coherence. The results demonstrated that participants with a SD had lower illness management levels, particularly for understanding their symptoms and taking appropriate actions in relation to health care. Poor self-rated health and the presence of comorbid conditions had a pervasive negative effect on self-management factors in the SD group, whereas being married, having a greater sense of coherence and being voluntary to treatment had a positive effect. Nurses need to develop strategies to address general health and self-management in older adults living with a SD.},

Several studies suggest that timely preventive measures may reduce heat-related excess mortality. The main aim of this study was to detect the temporal modification of heat-related mortality, in older adults (aged 65-74) and in elderly ≥75 years old, in the Florentine area by comparing previous (1999-2002) and subsequent (2004-2007) periods to the summer of 2003, when a regional Heat-Health Warning System (HHWS) was set up. Mortality data from 1999 to 2007 (May-September) were provided by the Mortality Registry of the Tuscany Region (n = 21,092). Weather data were used to assess daily apparent temperatures (AT). Case-crossover time-stratified designs and constrained segmented distributed lag models were applied. No significant heat-related mortality odds ratio (OR) variations were observed among the sub-periods. Nevertheless, a general OR decrease dating from 1999-2002 (OR 1.23; lack of HHWS) to 2004-2005 (OR 1.21; experimental HHWS running only for Florence) and to 2006-2007 (OR 1.12; official HHWS extended to the whole Florentine area) was observed when the maximum AT was considered. This modification was only evident in subjects ≥75 years old. The heat effect was higher and sustained for more days (until lag 9) during the period 1999-2002 than 2004-2007. The decrease of the excessive heat effect on mortality between periods with the absence and existence of a HHWS is also probably due to the mitigation of preventive measures and the implementation of a HHWS with specific interventions for safeguarding the health of the "frail elderly".},

Meta-analysis is an increasingly important approach to synthesizing evidence across studies. We conducted meta-analysis of short-term ozone exposure and respiratory hospitalizations to evaluate variation across studies and explore some of the challenges in meta-analysis. We identified 136 estimates from 96 studies and investigated how estimates differed by age, ozone metric, season, lag, region, disease category, and hospitalization type. Overall results indicate associations between ozone and various types of respiratory hospitalizations; however, study characteristics affected risk estimates. Estimates were similar, but higher, for the elderly compared to all ages and for previous day exposure compared to same day exposure. Comparison across studies was hindered by variation in definitions of disease categories, as some (e.g., asthma) were identified through ≥3 different sets of ICD codes. Although not all analyses exhibited evidence of publication bias, adjustment for publication bias generally lowered overall estimates. Emergency hospitalizations for total respiratory disease increased 4.47% (95% interval 2.48, 6.50%) per 10ppb 24-hr ozone among the elderly without adjustment for publication bias and 2.97% (1.05, 4.94%) with adjustment. Comparison of multi-city study results and meta-analysis based on single-city studies further suggested publication bias.},

In order to facilitate an effective outcome when teaching the basic principles of hand and respiratory hygiene, educational interventions should first target school children. As computer games are ubiquitous in most children's lives, e-Bug developed computer games targeted at teaching children handwashing, respiratory hygiene and antibiotic resistance. The games were designed for two target audiences: junior school children (9-12 year olds); and senior school children (13-15 year olds). Between May and August 2009, the finalized junior game underwent an evaluation in three UK schools (in Glasgow, Gloucester and London), involving 62 children in the schools and ∼ 1700 players accessing the junior game online. The e-Bug junior game consists of a number of levels of play, each of which promotes a set of learning outcomes (LOs). These LOs, complementary to those in the e-Bug packs, are expressed through the game mechanics (the rules of the game) rather than through story or dialogue. Although the junior game's evaluation demonstrated a statistically significant change in the knowledge for only a small number of given LOs, because many children had the required knowledge already before playing the game, this is e-Bug's first statistical study on the junior game and the first comprehensive evaluation of its kind. Future work includes a re-examination of the quiz-style questionnaires utilized in this study and an exploration of the potential knowledge change acquired strictly through engagement.},

Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to cause the increase in atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including the activation by particulate matter of inflammatory pathways and hemostasis factors, production of reactive oxygen species through the oxidative stress pathway, alterations in vascular tone, and decreased heart rate variability (a marker of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and a predictor of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias).

Daily rhythmicity of core temperature (T(c)) and locomotor activity (LA), as well as parameters representative of energy balance and IGF-1 levels which are involved in the aging process and stress resistance, were monitored in a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Adult and aged animals, acclimated to long days (LD) or short days (SD), were monitored during 8-day periods of exposure to 25 ° C and 34 ° C. Adult animals displayed efficient coping with heat exposure, regardless of the photoperiod. Hence, efficient responses resulted in decrease of energy intake, energy expenditure, IGF-1 levels and LA levels, promoting hyperthermia avoidance. Positive energy balance was maintained and water turnover did not change significantly after heat exposure. In contrast, while aged animals acclimated to LD responded similarly to adults, aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD showed great difficulties coping with heat exposure. Indeed, in this group, normothermia impairment was associated with increased T(c) levels, alterations in daily rhythmicity, negative energy balance and increased IGF-1 levels. Impaired responses to heat exposure were seen in aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD only. The main effects were observed during diurnal resting periods, suggesting decreased capacities with age to dissipate excess body heat. Taken together, these data highlight daily rhythmicity and IGF-1 pathway as main targets in the impaired response to heat exposure in the elderly.},

Though the idea of an implantable BSN was proposed in parallel with the on-body sensor network, the development in this area is relatively slow due to the complexity of human body, safety concerns, and some technological bottlenecks such as the design of ultralow-power implantable RF transceiver. This paper describes a new wireless implantable BSN that operates in medical implant communication service (MICS) frequency band. This system innovatively incorporates both sensing and actuation nodes to form a closed-control loop for physiological monitoring and drug delivery for critically ill patients. The sensing node, which is designed using system-on-chip technologies, takes advantage of the newly available ultralow-power Zarlink MICS transceiver for wireless data transmission. Finally, the specific absorption rate distribution of the proposed system was simulated to determine the in vivo electromagnetic field absorption and the power safety limits.},

The dysfunction of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), indicated by the disturbed heart rate variability (HRV), may be the most important underlying mechanism. Previous studies reported the heterogeneous associations between O(3) within several hours' exposure and HRV on general elderly subjects, in which poor surrogate of exposure evaluation and different health status of the subjects may be responsible for the heterogeneous associations. No studies were found focusing on the O(3)-mediated HRV effects within several minutes' exposure on healthy older subjects until recently. We measured the real-time 5-min ambient O(3) concentration and HRV frequency indices in 20 healthy elderly subjects in two surveys, with the 1st and 2nd survey in summer and winter, respectively. Mixed-linear model was used to evaluate the associations between the ambient 5-min average O(3) and concurrent 5-min HRV frequency indices measured during the outdoor period. After adjusting the co-pollutants (ambient PM(2.5) and nitrogen oxides concentrations) and subject characteristics, high frequency (HF) changed -4.87% (95% CI -8.62 to -0.97%) per 10 ppb increment of O(3), whereas decreased low frequency (LF) and increased LFHFR were found to be marginally associated with the elevated O(3) (P values were 0.092 and 0.069). We concluded that the ambient O(3) exert transient decrease effects on HRV, which may induce acute cardiac events.},

This paper provides a brief state-of-the-art overview of health and healthcare smartphone apps (applications) on the market today, including emerging trends and market uptake. Platforms available today include Android, Apple iOS, RIM BlackBerry, Symbian, and Windows (Windows Mobile 6.x and the emerging Windows Phone 7 platform). The paper covers apps targeting both laypersons/patients and healthcare professionals in various scenarios, e.g., health, fitness and lifestyle education and management apps; ambient assisted living apps; continuing professional education tools; and apps for public health surveillance. Among the surveyed apps are those assisting in chronic disease management, whether as standalone apps or part of a BAN (Body Area Network) and remote server configuration. We describe in detail the development of a smartphone app within eCAALYX (Enhanced Complete Ambient Assisted Living Experiment, 2009-2012), an EU-funded project for older people with multiple chronic conditions. The eCAALYX Android smartphone app receives input from a BAN (a patient-wearable smart garment with wireless health sensors) and the GPS (Global Positioning System) location sensor in the smartphone, and communicates over the Internet with a remote server accessible by healthcare professionals who are in charge of the remote monitoring and management of the older patient with multiple chronic conditions. Finally, we briefly discuss barriers to adoption of health and healthcare smartphone apps (e.g., cost, network bandwidth and battery power efficiency, usability, privacy issues, etc.), as well as some workarounds to mitigate those barriers.},

    abstract = {Although the relation between outdoor air pollution and daily mortality has been examined in several Chinese cities, there are still a number of key scientific issues to be addressed concerning the health effects of air pollution in China. Given the changes over the past decade in concentrations and sources of air pollution (e.g., the change from one predominant source [coal combustion], which was typical of the twentieth century, to a mix of sources [coal combustion and motor-vehicle emissions]) and transition in China, it is worthwhile to investigate the acute effects of outdoor air pollution on mortality outcomes in the country. We conducted a time-series study to investigate the relation between outdoor air pollution and daily mortality in Shanghai using four years of daily data (2001-2004). This study is a part of the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) program supported by the Health Effects Institute (HEI). We collected data on daily mortality, air pollution, and weather from the Shanghai Municipal Center of Disease Control and Prevention (SMCDCP), Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, and Shanghai Meteorologic Bureau. An independent auditing team assigned by HEI validated all the data. Our statistical analysis followed the Common Protocol of the PAPA program (found at the end of this volume). Briefly, a natural-spline model was used to analyze the mortality, air pollution, and covariate data. We first constructed the basic models for various mortality outcomes excluding variables for air pollution, and used the partial autocorrelation function of the residuals to guide the selection of degrees of freedom for time trend and lag days for the autoregression terms. Thereafter, we introduced the pollutant variables and analyzed their effects on mortality outcomes, including both mortality due to all natural (nonaccidental) causes and cause-specific mortality. We fitted single- and multipollutant models to assess the stability of the effects of the pollutants. For mortality due to all natural causes, we also examined the associations stratified by sex and age. Stratified analyses by education level, used as a measure of socioeconomic status, were conducted as well. In addition to an analysis of the entire study period, the effects of air pollution in just the warm season (from April to September) and cool season (from October to March) were analyzed. We also examined the effects of alternative model specifications--such as lag effects of pollutants and temperature, degrees of freedom for time trend and weather conditions, statistical approaches, and averaging methods for pollutant concentrations-on the estimated effects of air pollution. We found significant associations between the air pollutants--particulate matter 10 pm or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) -and daily mortality from all natural causes and from cardiopulmonary diseases. The increased mortality risks found in the data from Shanghai were generally similar in magnitude, per concentration of pollutant, to the risks found in research from other parts of the world. An increase of 10 microg/m3 in 2-day moving average concentrations of PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 corresponded to 0.26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.37), 0.95% (95% CI, 0.62-1.28), 0.97% (95% CI, 0.66-1.27), and 0.31% (95% CI, 0.04-0.58) increases, respectively, in mortality due to all natural causes. Sensitivity analyses suggested that our findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. We found significant effects of the gaseous pollutants SO2 and NO2 on daily mortality after adjustment for PM10. Our analysis also provided preliminary, but not conclusive, evidence that women, older people, and people with a low level of education might be more vulnerable to air pollution than men, younger people, and people with a high level of education. In addition, the associations between air pollution and daily mortality appeared to be more pronounced in the cool season than in the warm. We concluded that short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution (PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3) was associated with daily mortality in Shanghai and that gaseous pollutants might have independent health effects in the city. Overall, the results of the study appeared largely consistent with those reported in other locations worldwide. Further research will be needed to disentangle the effects of the various pollutants and to gain more conclusive insights into the influence of various sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., sex, age, and socioeconomic status) and of season on the associations between air pollution and daily mortality.},

We investigated the effects of nematode parasitism and other indicators of physiological impairment on the sequential complexity of foraging and locomotion behaviour among wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui). We observed all sexually mature individuals (n = 28) in one macaque study group between October 2007 and August 2008, and collected two faecal samples/month/individual (n = 362) for parasitological examination. We used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to investigate long-range autocorrelation in separate, binary sequences of foraging (n = 459) and locomotion (n = 446) behaviour collected via focal sampling. All behavioural sequences exhibited long-range autocorrelation, and linear mixed-effects models suggest that increasing infection with the nodular worm Oesophagostomum aculeatum, clinically impaired health, reproductive activity, ageing and low dominance status were associated with reductions in the complexity of locomotion, and to a lesser extent foraging, behaviour. Furthermore, the sequential complexity of behaviour increased with environmental complexity. We argue that a reduction in complexity in animal behaviour characterizes individuals in impaired or 'stressed' states, and may have consequences if animals cannot cope with heterogeneity in their natural habitats.},

    abstract = {With health care expenditures skyrocketing, coupled with pervasive quality deficits, pressures to provide better and more proficient care continue to shape the landscape of the U.S. health care system. Payers, both federal and private, have laid out several initiatives designed to curtail costs, including value-based reimbursement programs, cost-shifting expenses to the consumer, reducing reimbursements for physicians, steering health care to more efficient settings, and finally affordable health care reform. Consequently, one of the major aspects in the expansion of health care for improving quality and reducing the costs is surgical services. Nearly 57 million outpatient procedures are performed annually in the United States, 14 million of which occur in elderly patients. Increasing use of these minor, yet common, procedures contributes to rising health care expenditures. Once exclusive within hospitals, more and more outpatient procedures are being performed in freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), physician offices, visits to which have increased over 300% during the past decade. Concurrent with this growing demand, the number of ASCs has more than doubled since the 1990s, with more than 5,000 facilities currently in operation nationwide. Further, total surgical center ASC payments have increased from $1.2 billion in 1999 to $3.2 billion in 2009, a 167% increase. On the same lines, growth and expenditures for hospital outpatient department (HOPD) services and office procedures also have been evident at similar levels. Recent surveys have illustrated on overall annual growth per capita in Medicare allowed ASC services of pain management of 23%, with 27% growth seen in ASCs and 16% of the growth seen in HOPD. Further, the proportion of interventional pain management which was 4% of Medicare ASC spending in 2000 has increase to 10% in 2007. Thus, interventional pain management as an evolving specialty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in ASC settings apart from HOPDs and well-equipped offices. In June 1998, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), proposed an ASC rule in which at least 60% of interventional procedures were eliminated from ASCs and the remaining 40% faced substantial cuts in payments. Following the publication of this rule, based on public comments and demand, Congress intervened and delayed implementation of the rule for several years. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published its proposed outpatient prospective system for ASCs in 2006, setting ASC payments at 62% of HOPD payments. Following multiple changes, the rule was incorporated with a 4-year transition formula which ended in 2010, with full effect taking effect in 2011 with ASCs reimbursed at 57% of HOPD payments. Thus, the landscape of interventional pain management in ambulatory surgery centers has been constantly changing with declining reimbursements, issues of fraud and abuse, and ever-increasing regulations.},

An important issue is extending the time that older people can live in their home environment, by increasing their autonomy and helping them to carry out activities of daily living (ADLs). Research in the automatic detection of falls has received a lot of attention, with the object of enhancing safety, emergency response and independence of the elderly, at the same time comparing the social and economic costs related to fall accidents. In this work, an algorithmic framework to detect falls by using a 3D time-of-flight vision technology is presented. The proposed system presented complementary working requirements with respect to traditional worn and non-worn fall-detection devices. The vision system used a state-of-the-art 3D range camera for elderly movement measurement and detection of critical events, such as falls. The depth images provided by the active sensor allowed reliable segmentation and tracking of elderly movements, by using well-established imaging methods. Moreover, the range camera provided 3D metric information in all illumination conditions (even night vision), allowing the overcoming of some typical limitations of passive vision (shadows, camouflage, occlusions, brightness fluctuations, perspective ambiguity). A self-calibration algorithm guarantees different setup mountings of the range camera by non-technical users. A large dataset of simulated fall events and ADLs in real dwellings was collected and the proposed fall-detection system demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.},

Higher temperatures not only impact the comfort of urban dwellers, but also increase energy use, ozone production, and the risk of death for humans in a heat wave. Our research focuses on the variation in land surface temperature in the Gywnns Fall Watershed, Maryland. We found that land surface temperature is highly variable spatially, resulting in "hotspots" within the heat island. We further explore how this temperature variation relates to social factors on the scale of the census-based block group. We show that land surface temperature is statistically higher in block groups that are characterized by low income, high poverty, less education, more ethnic minorities, more elderly people and greater risk of crime. These variables were mapped to evaluate the spatial relationship of land surface temperatures to social factors. This spatially explicit approach facilitates identification of specific areas to prioritize for heat prevention and intervention efforts. We demonstrate, through an exercise, how incorporating data on land surface temperature and social factors into heat intervention strategies could contribute to efficient allocation of limited resources and services. The exercise also indicates where heat prevention efforts, such as tree-planting programs, are most needed to help reduce heat exposure and moderate the urban heat island effect.},

We designed a reminder system for appointments and activities that uses different sounds, light colours or vibration patterns to represent different categories of calendar events such as upcoming tasks and appointments. The evaluation results show a preference for solely acoustic presentations or an acoustic presentation in combination with visual and tactile output. In our future work, we will refine the ambient and interactive presentation and implement and evaluate this technology in residential homes.},

Although GAL's high interdisciplinarity at the beginning slowed down the speed of research progress, we can now work on problems, which can hardly be solved by one or few disciplines alone. Interdisciplinary research projects on ICT in ageing societies are needed and recommended.},

Falls are the most common causes of serious injuries and a major health threats in the stratum of older population.

In this paper, we present a support system for detecting falls of an elder person by a static wireless nonintrusive sensorial infrastructure based on heterogenous sensor nodes. This previous infrastructure, named AID (Alarm Intelligent Device), is an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system that allows to infer a potential fall. We have developed, different to other contributions, a specific low-power multi-hop network consists of nodes (Motes) that wirelessly communicate to each other and are capable of hopping radio messages to a base station where they are passed to a PC (or other possible client).

This study examined the association between respiratory symptoms and outdoor wood smoke in Launceston, Tasmania, where ~30% of homes use wood burners for domestic heating. This ecological study examined data from participants of the 2004 Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study postal survey and compared the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in Launceston (n=601) with that in Hobart (n=1071), a larger Tasmanian city with much less wood smoke. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations of interest while adjusting for gender, atopy, history of allergic disease and current smoking status. There were no significant differences in symptom prevalence between Launceston and Hobart. Two subgroup analyses, which examined participants with pre-existing chronic respiratory disease, and those who reported actively using a wood burner in their home, also did not find significant differences. Any impact of wood smoke on non-specific respiratory symptoms might have been overshadowed by other important determinants of respiratory health, such as vehicle exhaust and tobacco smoking, or were too small to have been detected. However, the lack of detectable differences in symptom prevalence might also reflect the success of regulatory action by local governments to reduce wood smoke emissions in Launceston. The results of other epidemiological studies support an association between ambient wood smoke exposure and adverse respiratory health. Further investigations of wood smoke exposure in Australian settings are needed to investigate the lack of significant associations found in this study, especially studies of indoor air quality and health impacts in children and elderly populations.},

Respondents were recruited through clinics (response rate 71%) and interviews were conducted in their homes or by telephone. Results showed that 73% of participants reported having a home air conditioner. The average number of hours spent per 24-hour period in air-conditioned spaces during heat waves was 14.5 hours (SD = 9.4). Exploratory structural equation modeling showed that specific beliefs about the benefits of and drawbacks to AC as well as internal cues to action were predictive of its level of use, whereas the perceived severity of the effects of heat on health was not. The findings are discussed in light of the need to adequately support effective response to extreme heat in this vulnerable population.},

However, several controversies exist as to the range of predicted normal values for these measurements in the elderly population, and the clinical presentation of COPD in the elderly may be complicated by the presence of several comorbidities. Many non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available for managing COPD. However, management of COPD in the elderly population may be challenged by the "polypharmacy" of medications that these patients often take, which can interfere with compliance with therapy. Additionally, the elderly often suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities that can prevent compliance with prescribed medications. Lastly, adverse effects from medications prescribed for treatment of COPD may be more pervasive in elderly patients.},

    abstract = {The short-term effects of high temperatures are a serious concern in the context of climate change. In areas that today have mild climates the research activity has been rather limited, despite the fact that differences in temperature susceptibility will play a fundamental role in understanding the exposure, acclimatization, adaptation and health risks of a changing climate. In addition, many studies employ biometeorological indexes without careful investigation of the regional heterogeneity in the impact of relative humidity. We aimed to investigate the effects of summer temperature and relative humidity and regional differences in three regions of Sweden allowing for heterogeneity of the effect over the scale of summer temperature. To do so, we collected mortality data for ages 65+ from Stockholm, Göteborg and Skåne from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for the years 1998 through 2005. In Stockholm and Skåne on average 22 deaths per day occurred, while in Göteborg the mean frequency of daily deaths was 10. We fitted time-series regression models to estimate relative risks of high ambient temperatures on daily mortality using smooth functions to control for confounders, and estimated non-linear effects of exposure while allowing for auto-regressive correlation of observations within summers. The effect of temperature on mortality was found distributed over the same or following day, with statistically significant cumulative combined relative risk of about 5.1% (CI = 0.3, 10.1) per degrees C above the 90th percentile of summer temperature. The effect of high relative humidity was statistically significant in only one of the regions, as was the effect of relative humidity (above 80th percentile) and temperature (above 90th percentile). In the southernmost region studied there appeared to be a significant increase in mortality with decreasing low summer temperatures that was not apparent in the two more northerly situated regions. The effects of warm temperatures on the elderly population in Sweden are rather strong and consistent across different regions after adjustment for mortality displacement. The impact of relative humidity appears to be different in regions, and may be a more important predictor of mortality in some areas.},

Current cross-sectional data from the Nakanojo Study, which we have been carrying out since 2000, indicate substantial associations between the overall health of participants, and both the year-averaged daily step count and the year-averaged daily duration of effort undertaken at an intensity >3 metabolic equivalents (MET). In men, the extent of health is associated more closely with the daily duration of activity >3 MET than with the daily step count, whereas in women the association is closer for the step count than for the duration of activity >3 MET. In both sexes, the threshold amount of physical activity associated with better health is greater for physical than for mental benefits: >8000 vs >4000 steps/day and/or >20 vs >5 min/day at >3 MET, respectively. In other words, physical health is better in those spending at least 20 min/day in moderate walking (at a pace of around 1.4 m/s [5 km/h]) and a further >60 min of light activity per day. In contrast, better mental health is associated with much smaller amounts of deliberate physical activity. Both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature. Activity decreases exponentially to about 4000 steps/day as precipitation increases. Excluding the influence of rainfall, the daily step count peaks at a mean outdoor temperature of around 17 degrees C; above and especially below such readings, physical activity decreases as a quadratic function of temperature. Seasonal changes in the microclimate should thus be considered when designing interventions intended to increase the habitual physical activity of older adults. Based on these findings, we are now developing preventive tactics that should contribute to health promotion, disease prevention and thus a reduction in medical expenses for elderly people.},

Therefore, preventive and assistive systems that allow elderly people to independently live in their own homes as long as possible will become an economical if not ethical necessity. These respective technologies are being developed under the term "Ambient Assistive Technologies" (AAT). The EU-funded AAT-project Ambient Lighting Assistance for an Ageing Population (ALADIN) has established the long-term goal to create an adaptive system capable of improving the residential lighting conditions of single living elderly persons also aiming at supporting the preservation of their independence.Results of an earlier survey revealed that the elderly perceived their current lighting situation as satisfactory, whereas interviewers assessed in-house lighting as too dark and risk-laden. The overall results of ALADIN showed a significant increase in well-being from the baseline final testing with the new adaptive lighting system.Positive results for wellbeing and life quality suggest that the outcome effects may be attributed to the introduction of technology as well as to social contacts arising from participating in the study. The technological guidance of the study supervisors, in particular, may have produced a strong social reactivity effect that was first observed in the famous Hawthorne experiments in the 1930s. As older adults seem to benefit both from meaningful social contacts as well as assistive technologies, the question arises how assistive technology can be socially embedded to be able to maximize positive health effects. Therefore ethical guidelines for development and use of new assistive technologies for handicapped/older persons have to be developed and should be discussed with regard to their applicability in the context of AAT.},

Exposure assessment models attempt to predict and proxy for individuals' personal exposure to ambient air pollution, and there are no studies to date that explicitly attempt to compare and cross-validate personal exposure concentrations with pollutants modeled at the intra-urban level using methods such as interpolated surfaces and land-use regression (LUR) models. This study aimed to identify how well personal exposure to NO(2) (nitrogen dioxide) can be predicted from ambient exposure measurements and intra-urban exposure estimates using LUR and what other factors contribute to predicting variations in personal exposure beyond measured pollutant levels within home. Personal, indoor and outdoor NO(2) were measured in a population of older adults (>65 yr old) living in Hamilton, Canada. Our results show that personal NO(2) was most strongly associated with contemporaneously collected indoor and outdoor concentrations of NO(2). Predicted NO(2) exposures from intra-urban LUR models were not associated with personal NO(2), whereas interpolated surfaces of particulates and ozone were modestly associated. Combinations of variables that best predicted personal NO(2) variability were derived from time-activity diaries, interpolated surfaces of ambient particulate pollutants, and a city wide temporally matched average of NO(2). The nonsignificant associations between personal NO(2) and the modeled ambient NO(2) concentrations suggest that observed associations between NO(2) generated by LUR models and health effects are probably not produced by NO(2), but by other pollutants that follow a similar spatial pattern.},

Its population in 2004 was 340,000 inhabitants with 1587 annual deaths, of which 24% were due to cardiovascular and 11% to respiratory causes. For hospital admissions, cardiovascular diseases represented 6% and respiratory diseases 13%. Emergency room visits for acute respiratory infections represented 28%. The objective of the study presented here was to determine the relationship between air pollution from particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10; mostly PM2.5, or particulate matter <2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) and health effects measured as the daily number of deaths, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits for cardiovascular, respiratory, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) diseases. The Air Pollution Health Effects European Approach (APHEA2) protocol was followed, and a multivariate Poisson regression model was fitted, controlling for trend, seasonality, and confounders for Temuco during 1998-2006. The results show that PM10 had a significant association with daily mortality and morbidity, with the elderly (population >65 yr of age) being the group that presented the greatest risk. The relative risk for respiratory causes, with an increase of 100 microg/m3 of PM10, was 1.163 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.057-1.279 for mortality, 1.137 (CI 1.096-1.178) for hospital admissions, and 1.162 for ARI (CI 1.144-1.181). There is evidence in Temuco of positive relationships between ambient particulate levels and mortality, hospital admissions, and ARI for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These results are consistent with those of comparable studies in other similar cities where wood smoke is the most important air pollution problem.},

    abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a ubiquitous atmospheric pollutant due to the widespread prevalence of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and it can be a respiratory irritant when inhaled at elevated concentrations. Evidence for health effects of ambient NO2 derives from three types of studies: observational epidemiology, human clinical exposures, and animal toxicology. Our review focuses on the human clinical studies of adverse health effects of short-term NO2 exposures, given the substantial uncertainties and limitations in interpretation of the other lines of evidence. We examined more than 50 experimental studies of humans inhaling NO2, finding notably that the reporting of statistically significant changes in lung function and bronchial sensitivity did not show a consistent trend with increasing NO2 concentrations. Functional changes were generally mild and transient, the reported effects were not uniformly adverse, and they were not usually accompanied by NO2-dependent increases in symptoms. The available human clinical results do not establish a mechanistic pathway leading to adverse health impacts for short-term NO2 exposures at levels typical of maximum 1-h concentrations in the present-day ambient environment (i.e., below 0.2 ppm). Our review of these data indicates that a health-protective, short-term NO2 guideline level for susceptible (and healthy) populations would reflect a policy choice between 0.2 and 0.6 ppm. EXTENDED ABSTRACT: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a ubiquitous atmospheric pollutant due to the widespread prevalence of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and it can be a respiratory irritant when inhaled at elevated concentrations. Natural NO2 sources include volcanic action, forest fires, lightning, and the stratosphere; man-made NO2 emissions derive from fossil fuel combustion and incineration. The current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for NO2, initially established in 1971, is 0.053 ppm (annual average). Ambient concentrations monitored in urban areas in the United States are approximately 0.015 ppm, as an annual mean, i.e., below the current NAAQS. Short-term (1-h peak) NO2 concentrations outdoors are not likely to exceed 0.2 ppm, and even 1-h periods exceeding 0.1 ppm are infrequent. Inside homes, 1-h NO2 peaks, typically arising from gas cooking, can range between 0.4 and 1.5 ppm. The health effects evidence of relevance to ambient NO2 derives from three lines of investigation: epidemiology studies, human clinical studies, and animal toxicology studies. The NO2 epidemiology remains inconsistent and uncertain due to the potential for exposure misclassification, residual confounding, and co-pollutant effects, whereas animal toxicology findings using high levels of NO2 exposure require extrapolation to humans exposed at low ambient NO2 levels. Given the limitations and uncertainties in the other lines of health effects evidence, our review thus focused on clinical studies where human volunteers (including asthmatics, children, and elderly) inhaled NO2 at levels from 0.1 to 3.5 ppm during short-term ((1/2)-6-h) exposures, often combined with exercise, and occasionally combined with co-pollutants. We examined the reported biological effects and classified them into (a) lung immune responses and inflammation, (b) lung function changes and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and (c) health effects outside the lungs (extrapulmonary). We examined more than 50 experimental studies of humans inhaling NO2, finding that such clinical data on short-term exposure allowed discrimination of NO2 no-effect levels versus lowest-adverse-effects levels. Our conclusions are summarized by these six points: For lung immune responses and inflammation: (1) healthy subjects exposed to NO2 below 1 ppm do not show pulmonary inflammation; (2) at 2 ppm for 4 h, neutrophils and cytokines in lung-lavage fluid can increase, but these changes do not necessarily correlate with significant or sustained changes in lung function; (3) there is no consistent evidence that NO2 concentrations below 2 ppm increase susceptibility to viral infection; (4) for asthmatics and individuals having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), NO2-induced lung inflammation is not expected below 0.6 ppm, although one research group reported enhancement of proinflammatory processes at 0.26 ppm. With regard to NO2-induced AHR: (5) studies of responses to specific or nonspecific airway challenges (e.g., ragweed, methacholine) suggest that asthmatic individuals were not affected by NO2 up to about 0.6 ppm, although some sensitive subsets may respond to levels as low as 0.2 ppm. And finally, for extra-pulmonary effects: (6) such effects (e.g., changes in blood chemistry) generally required NO2 concentrations above 1-2 ppm. Overall, our review of data from experiments with humans indicates that a health-protective, short-term-average NO2 guideline level for susceptible populations (and healthy populations) would reflect a policy choice between 0.2 and 0.6 ppm. The available human clinical results do not establish a mechanistic pathway leading to adverse health impacts for short-term NO2 exposures at levels typical of maximum 1-h concentrations in the present-day ambient environment (i.e., below 0.2 ppm).},

    abstract = {Evaluating a company's performance often entails wading through a thicket of numbers produced by a few simple metrics, writes the author, and senior executives leave measurement to those whose specialty is spreadsheets. To take ownership of performance assessment, those executives should find qualitative, forward-looking measures that will help them avoid five common traps: Measuring against yourself. Find data from outside the company, and reward relative, rather than absolute, performance. Enterprise Rent-A-Car uses a service quality index to measure customers' repeat purchase intentions. Looking backward. Use measures that lead rather than lag the profits in your business. Humana, a health insurer, found that the sickest 10% of its patients account for 80% of its costs; now it offers customers incentives for early screening. Putting your faith in numbers. The soft drinks company Britvic evaluates its executive coaching program not by trying to assign it an ROI number but by tracking participants' careers for a year. Gaming your metrics. The law firm Clifford Chance replaced its single, easy-to-game metric of billable hours with seven criteria on which to base bonuses. Sticking to your numbers too long. Be precise about what you want to assess and explicit about what metrics are assessing it. Such clarity would have helped investors interpret the AAA ratings involved in the financial meltdown. Really good assessment will combine finance managers' relative independence with line managers' expertise.},

First, a discussion of the relationship between cognitive and physical health shows the increasing weight given to the role of declines in cognition in the development of dependency in older adult population studies. Second, evidence that cognitive training produces 'far transfer' in elders is presented. The key issue is that one approach, known as extended practice training, has been successful in producing far transfer to memory and other processes. Its principles, which are consistent with those associated with positive brain plasticity effects, are identified. Those principles are then related to the mechanics of digital action games, which also have the important added feature of producing the experiences of presence, engagement, and flow, the subjective elements of game play that are likely to sustain interest and emotional investment in the skills practiced so that the play produces cognitive benefits. The specific cognitive abilities proposed to be improved by different types of game genres are outlined, and recent developments in game and interface design that may affect the willingness of older adults to play are described.},

The following data, mostly from Norway, will be reviewed: Variation of ambient solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) and vitamin D status with season and latitude, variation of incidence rates and prognosis of skin cancer and variation of prognosis of internal cancer with latitude and season. In short, the following issues are discussed: 1) Vitamin D level varies with season, but probably not with latitude in Norway, because of an increased intake of vitamin D in the north; 2) Skin cancer incidence rates increase from north to south, as do annual fluence rates of UV radiation, while there seems to be a slight improvement in prognosis from north to south; 3) Prognosis of internal cancer is best for cases diagnosed in the seasons with the best vitamin D status, i.e. in summer and autumn; 4) Incidence rates of cutaneous melanomas have increased from 1960 to 1990, but have decreased slightly thereafter for young people; 5) Changes in sun exposure habits have taken place; 6) An increase in body mass index (BMI) of the population has occurred, which may have led to a worsening of the vitamin D status.},

The aim of this work is to highlight the interactions that may take place among siblings when deciding whether or not to become a caregiver. We look at families with two children using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe; our sample contains 314 dependent elderly and their 628 adult children. In order to identify the interactions between siblings, we have specified a two-person discrete game model. To estimate this model, without invoking the 'coherency' condition, we have added an endogenous selection rule to solve the incompleteness problem arising from multiplicity or absence of equilibrium. Our empirical results suggest that the three classical effects identified by Manski could potentially explain the observed correlation between the siblings' caregiving behaviour. Correlated effects alone appear to be weak. Contextual interactions and endogenous interactions reveal cross-effects. The asymmetric character of the endogenous interactions is our most striking result. The younger child's involvement appears to increase the net benefit of caregiving for the elder one, whereas the elder child's involvement decreases the net benefit of caregiving for the younger child.},

    abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have established an association between exposures to air pollution particles and human mortality and morbidity at concentrations of particles currently found in major metropolitan areas. The adverse effects of pollution particles are most prominent in susceptible subjects, including the elderly and patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. Controlled human exposure studies have been used to confirm the causal relationship between pollution particle exposure and adverse health effects. Earlier studies enrolled mostly young healthy subjects and have largely confirmed the capability of particles to cause adverse health effects shown in epidemiological studies. In the last few years, more studies involving susceptible populations have been published. These recent studies in susceptible populations, however, have shown that the adverse responses to particles appear diminished in these susceptible subjects compared to those in healthy subjects. The present paper reviewed and compared control human exposure studies to particles and sought to explain the "unexpected" response to particle exposure in these susceptible populations and make recommendations for future studies. We found that the causes for the discrepant results are likely multifactorial. Factors such as medications, the disease itself, genetic susceptibility, subject selection bias that is intrinsic to many controlled exposure studies and nonspecificity of study endpoints may explain part of the results. Future controlled exposure studies should select endpoints that are more closely related to the pathogenesis of the disease and reflect the severity of particle-induced health effects in the specific populations under investigation. Future studies should also attempt to control for medications and genetic susceptibility. Using a different study design, such as exposing subjects to filtered air and ambient levels of particles, and assessing the improvement in biological endpoints during filtered air exposure, may allow the inclusion of higher risk patients who are likely the main contributors to the increased particle-induced health effects in epidemiological studies.},

    abstract = {In older adults, as in younger individuals, habitual moderate-intensity physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of various chronic health conditions, including certain types of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease and certain forms of cancer. However, the pattern of physical activity associated with such benefits remains unclear. One problem is that most investigators have examined patterns of physical activity using either subjective questionnaires or accelerometer or pedometer measurements limited to a single week, despite clear evidence of both the unreliability/invalidity of questionnaires and seasonal changes in activity patterns. Since 2000, we have thus conducted an interdisciplinary study examining the habitual physical activity and health of elderly people living in a medium-sized Japanese town (the Nakanojo Study). In about one-tenth of some 5000 available subjects aged > or =65 years, physical activity has already been assessed continuously for 24 h/day for >8 years using a specially adapted pedometer/accelerometer. This device has a storage capacity of 36 days and can distinguish >10 intensities of physical activity (expressed in metabolic equivalents [METs]). Data have to date been summarized as daily step counts and daily durations of activity of <3 and >3 METs, averaged over a 1-year period. This article provides a detailed overview of both factors influencing habitual physical activity and relationships between such activity and health in an elderly population. To date, analyses have been cross-sectional in type. Substantial associations have been noted between the overall health of participants and both the daily duration of effort undertaken at an intensity of >3 METs and the daily step count. In men, the extent of health is associated more closely with the daily duration of activity of >3 METs than with the daily step count, whereas in women, the association is closer for the step count than for the duration of activity >3 METs. In both sexes, the threshold amount of physical activity associated with better health is greater for physical than for mental benefits: >8000 versus >4000 steps/day and/or >20 versus >5 min/day at an intensity >3 METs, respectively. In other words, better physical health is seen in those spending at least 20 min/day in moderate walking (at a pace of around 1.4 m/s [5 km/h]) and a further >60 min of light activity per day. In contrast, better mental health is associated with much smaller amounts of deliberate physical activity. The daily step count and the daily durations of activity of <3 and >3 METs are all influenced by meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature. Activity decreases exponentially to about 4000 steps/day as precipitation increases. Excluding the influence of rainfall, the daily step count peaks at a mean outdoor temperature of around 17 degrees C; above and especially below such readings, physical activity decreases as a quadratic function of temperature. Seasonal changes in microclimate should thus be considered when designing interventions intended to increase the habitual physical activity of elderly people. The observed associations between physical activity and health outcomes point to a need for longitudinal analyses; these should examine potential causal interpretations of the current findings and elucidate possible additional mediating variables.},

Pb is ubiquitous in the environment and is used in many building materials. Environmental Pb concentrations and body burdens of Pb have been shown to increase following disasters. Pb is a systemic toxicant with no known beneficial biological function and, for several endpoints, no identified threshold of toxicity. The fetus, children, pregnant and elderly are particularly susceptible to some of the toxic effects of Pb. Pb exposures in infancy have been shown in vivo to produce an equal degree of neurobehavioural impairment as exposures of much longer duration at equivalent doses during adolescence. Evidence from animal bioassays indicates that the carcinogenic potency of perinatal Pb exposure may be about 3-fold higher than adult lifetime exposure at an equivalent dose. Animal assays show up to a 12-fold difference between fetal, neonatal and adult life stages in sensitivity to the immunological effects of Pb. Pb exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality--health endpoints for which the elderly are at increased risk. Finally, endogenous and exogenous variables, such as psychological and physiological stress, dietary deficiencies and concomitant exposure to other chemical, biological and radiological hazards, can also potentially modify or potentiate the toxic effects of Pb. Because of the potential for concurrent influence of these modifying variables in a post-disaster environment, emergency response planners are encouraged to consider disaster victims and responders, as a whole, as a potentially vulnerable subpopulation.},

Sensor data are transmitted to a laptop and displayed on a Matlab graphic user interface (GUI). We have performed zero base and treadmill experiments to investigate sensor performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20m indoors and 50m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements were found to follow the Optotrak measurement trend but could be improved further by dealing with double integration errors and improving data transmission rates.},

That road is used to know the drawbacks of current devices and systems, besides to allow studying several important concepts underlying the principles of fall detection. A novel smart detection system based on that survey is finally briefly presented.

The fatty-acid and wax-rich impermeable cell wall of the mycobacteria allow for adherence to solid substrates such as pipes and leaves, allowing the organism to persist despite treatment with common disinfectants. Mycobacteria can cause infection in both humans and animals. It is difficult to assess the incidence or prevalence of NTM disease due to multiple factors. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection may be difficult to differentiate from colonization, and when NTM infection is diagnosed, it is not a reportable disease. Furthermore, some species such as Mycobacterium gordonae may be a contaminant. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infection is not a communicable disease, although health care-associated outbreaks have been reported, associated with a single facility or procedure. While the nontuberculous infection may affect other organs, the most common site is the lung, and the most common species is Mycobacterium avium complex, commonly referred to as MAC infection. An increasing occurrence of MAC has been reported, especially in certain populations such as middle-aged or elderly thin women, patients with chronic lung disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and cystic fibrosis. An association of NTM infection with gastroesophageal reflux disease has also been noted. The clinical presentation often includes chronic productive cough. Other less common symptoms include dyspnea and hemoptysis. With increased use of computed tomography and high-resolution computed tomography, patterns of MAC pulmonary infection have been described. Recently, the American Thoracic Society has outlined guidelines for the diagnosis and management of NTM infection. Treatment of NTM infection requires at least 3 effective drugs for a minimum of 12 months after sputum conversion to negative cultures. Surgical therapy may be considered for localized disease which has failed medical management. In this article, the clinical presentation, radiographic features, diagnostic evaluation, and management are discussed.},

Similar advances in wireless communication, sensor design and energy storage have meant that the concept of a truly pervasive 'wireless sensor network', used to monitor environments and objects within them, has become a reality. The need for a wireless sensor network designed specifically for human body monitoring has led to the development of wireless 'body sensor network' (BSN) platforms composed of tiny integrated microsensors with on-board processing and wireless data transfer capability. The ubiquitous computing abilities of BSNs offer the prospect of continuous monitoring of human health in any environment, be it home, hospital, outdoors or the workplace. This pervasive technology comes at a time when Western world health care costs have sharply risen, reflected by increasing expenditure on health care as a proportion of gross domestic product over the last 20 years. Drivers of this rise include an ageing post 'baby boom' population, higher incidence of chronic disease and the need for earlier diagnosis. This paper outlines the role of pervasive health care technologies in providing more efficient health care.},

Using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, they obtained county-specific estimates of mortality, which were combined in meta-analyses. A total of 231,676 nonaccidental deaths were included. Each 10 degrees F (approximately 4.7 degrees C) increase in mean daily apparent temperature corresponded to a 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.9) increase for cardiovascular mortality, with the most significant risk found for ischemic heart disease. Elevated risks were also found for persons at least 65 years of age (2.2%, 95% CI: 0.04, 4.0), infants 1 year of age or less (4.9%, 95% CI: -1.8, 11.6), and the Black racial/ethnic group (4.9%, 95% CI: 2.0, 7.9).

It was expected that students would learn the principles of a home visit using a video game while identifying the usefulness of video gaming (edutainment) in geriatrics education. A video game was created simulating a patient's house that the students were able to explore. Students played against time and distracters while being expected to click on those elements that they considered to be risk factors for falls or harmful for the patient. At the end of the game, the students received feedback on the chosen elements that were right or wrong. Finally, evaluation of the tool was obtained using pre- and posttests and pre- and postexposure feedback surveys. Fifty-six fourth-year medical students used the video game and completed the tests and the feedback surveys. This method showed a high level of engagement that is associated with improvement in knowledge. Additionally, users' feedback indicated that it was an innovative approach to the teaching of health sciences. In summary, this method provides medical students with a fun and structured experience that has an effect not only on their learning, but also on their understanding of the particular needs of the elderly population.},

Our analysis suggests that these factors are unlikely to cause bias in time-series studies, although it may be important in panel and other longitudinal studies. Specifically, we argue that: (1) persons most likely to be susceptible to the effects of air pollution, notably the very young and the elderly, and those suffering from certain chronic diseases (e.g., congestive heart failure), are unlikely to be highly exposed to traffic and therefore to traffic-related stress and (2) over lengthy periods of time and sub-populations, levels of individual stress are unlikely to act coherently to create an association with ambient air pollution.},

Research shows that humor stimulus results in mirth, which elicits a primarily emotional response with psychological efects, and laughter, which elicits a physical response with physiological effects. The many physiological benefits of laughter in older adults have been clearly demonstrated. Yet much of the medical research is based on experiments using funny videos and cartoons for humor sessions. I argue that "clowning around" with elderly people brings greater benefits than laughter alone. These benefits are clearly evident, though they may not be scientifically measurable: When the game is rooted in the patient's own imagination, thereby giving agency to a powerless individual it is many times more personal and transformative. In this article, I focus on my experiences with older adults while working with Clowns Without Borders and Risaterapia as well as on my own relationship with my grandfather.

It is discussed how emergency medical services (EMS) can contribute to the problems of an ageing society beyond the scope of a system which is dedicated only to the individual. One possibility is the epidemiological analysis of geriatric emergencies, the accompanying context factors and the development of an adequate infrastructure which is adapted to the needs of the elderly. The EU project EMERGE is an example of how emergency medical expertise is utilized in an interdisciplinary cooperation. An automatically working system based on ambient sensor technology is developed for early detection and prevention of emergency situations in the home environment. Supportive technology ("assisted living") should enable the elderly to live a safe and self-determined life as long as possible. Integration of this additional information into the processes of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is the logistic prerequisite to establish a social medical assistance tailored to the needs of an ageing society.},

To describe the incidence of falls/injuries in a walking team ball game (Lifeball) designed for seniors, a prospective cohort study was undertaken amongst community dwelling Lifeball participants in Australia. Players completed a telephone survey soon after commencing Lifeball (2004) and 12 months later (2005). Attendance and incident records were audited for the period. Subjects joined a Lifeball group with opportunity to play at least once per week. Baseline was completed by 284 players aged between 40 and 96 years (mean 67 years), with most (83.8%, 238/284) female. Of 263 followed up, the average attendances was 25, with 19.3% attending on fewer than 4 occasions and 14.3% attending 52 or more times. Most (93.9%) reported no injuries requiring medical attention. However, 16 (6.1%) had injuries requiring medical attention and their 27 injuries represent an injury rate of 3.3 per 1000hours of participation. Twenty participants (7.6%) had a Lifeball fall equating to a fall rate of 2.8 per 1000hours of participation. Falls in Lifeball were not associated with measured predictors (age, gender, falls history, perceived falls risk or hours played). Incident records showed a trip/stumble involving rushing, walking backwards, or overextending (all against rules) as common falling causes. Lifeball is not 'risk free' however due to a lack of comparative data it is difficult to compare injury rate to relevant activities. Prevention of injury should concentrate on enforcing safety rules.},

    abstract = {As life expectancy in the West increases and companies can no longer promise lifelong security, many businesspeople will need to make major changes during middle age, embarking on a second life and a second career. They must start by getting beyond two pervasive and opposing myths. The first is that midlife marks the onset of decline. Problems do arise during middle age--concerns about health and finances, for instance--but one's life force does not expire at 65, nor do possibilities vanish. In fact, by middle age, most executives have gained a freedom that only self-knowledge can impart, and they relish unprecedented opportunities for personal growth. Midlife transitions, however, must be rooted in realism, not driven by the second myth, which paints middle age as a time of magical transformation. Contrary to what self-help books and inspirational speakers proclaim, such transformations do not happen. A 50-year-old with little musical training, for instance, will not suddenly become a concert pianist. People who buy into this myth find that their inevitable disappointment can be debilitating. Paradoxically, the doctrine that aims to encourage change actually stifles it. To make successful transitions, executives must stay open to the possibilities their experience qualifies them for but remain realistic about what they can achieve. For companies, employees' midlife transitions represent both a challenge (senior managers seemingly on track to become CEO may instead leave) and an opportunity (other midlife executives, with different perspectives and experiences, may knock on the door). Organizations must help middle-aged executives through this difficult period, not just by offering a workshop or two but by providing ongoing coaching and opportunities for personal and professional development.},

Diesel exhaust contributes significantly to the ambient particle pollution burden. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if exposure to a common component of diesel exhaust, phenanthraquinone (PQ), impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery and to determine whether age, gender, and/or hormonal status alter the putative effects of PQ on vasodilation. Vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) was assessed in vitro in intact control (age 6, 14, and 24 mo) and ovariectomized (age 6, 14, and 24 mo) female rats and intact (age 6 and 24 mo) male rats. Gender did not influence vasodilator capacity of the femoral principal nutrient artery, and there was an age-related decline in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in both female and male 24-mo-old rats. Exposure to PQ elicited a gender-specific affect in 6-mo-old rats; i.e., vasodilation was impaired 63% in male rats but had no effect in female rats. Exposure to PQ abolished vasodilation in 14- and 24-mo-old rats of both genders, and ovariectomy compromised vasodilator responsiveness to ACh in all age groups. The data demonstrate a vasoprotective mechanism in young female rats that may be related to endogenous ovarian hormones and provides evidence that suggests certain subsets of the population (e.g., elderly, males, and postmenopausal women) may be more susceptible to the adverse consequences of airborne pollutants.},

Our studies in rats have shown that pharmacological doses of oestradiol administered during the critical window of prostate development result in marked prostate pathology in adulthood that progress to neoplastic lesions with ageing. Our recent studies have also demonstrated that transient developmental exposure of rats to low, environmentally relevant doses of bisphenol A or oestradiol increases prostate gland susceptibility to adult-onset precancerous lesions and hormonal carcinogenesis. These findings indicate that a wide range of oestrogenic exposures during development can predispose to prostatic neoplasia that suggests a potential developmental basis for this adult disease. To identify a molecular basis for oestrogen imprinting, we screened for DNA methylation changes over time in the exposed prostate glands. We found permanent alterations in DNA methylation patterns of multiple cell signalling genes suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of action. For phosphodiesterase type 4 variant 4 (PDE4D4), an enzyme responsible for intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate breakdown, a specific methylation cluster was identified in the 5'-flanking CpG island that was gradually hypermethylated with ageing in normal prostates resulting in loss of gene expression. However, in prostates exposed to neonatal oestradiol or bisphenol A, this region became hypomethylated with ageing resulting in persistent and elevated PDE4D4 expression. In total, these findings indicate that low-dose exposures to ubiquitous environmental oestrogens impact the prostate epigenome during development and in so doing, promote prostate disease with ageing.},

Numerous studies examining short-term effects of air pollution show significant associations between ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) and other air pollutants and increases in premature mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Several well-designed epidemiological studies confirmed the adverse long-term effects of PM on both mortality and morbidity. Epidemiological studies also document significant associations between ozone (O3), sulfur (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) and adverse health outcomes; however, the effects of gaseous pollutants are less well documented. Subpopulations that are more susceptible to air pollution include children, the elderly, those with cardiorespiratory disease, and socioeconomically deprived individuals. Canada-wide standards for ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were set in 2000, providing air quality targets to be achieved by 2010. In the United States, the Clean Air Act provides the framework for the establishment and review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for criteria air pollutants and the establishment of emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants. The 1996 European Union's enactment of the Framework Directive for Air Quality established the process for setting Europe-wide limit values for a series of pollutants. The Clean Air for Europe program was established by the European Union to review existing limit values, emission ceilings, and abatement protocols, as set out in the current legislation. These initiatives serve as the legislative framework for air quality management in North America and Europe.},

This study considers the differences in temperatures measured at the airport and in the city centre of three Italian cities (Milan, Rome and Turin) and investigates the impact of these measures on daily mortality. The case-crossover design was applied to evaluate the association between daily mean apparent temperature (MAT) and daily total mortality. The analysis was conducted for the entire population and for subgroups defined by demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status and chronic comorbidity (based on hospitalisation during the preceding 2 years). The percentage risk of dying, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), on a day with MAT at the 95th percentile with respect to the 25th percentile of the June-September daily distribution was estimated. Airport and city-centre temperature distributions, which vary among cities and between stations, have a heterogeneous impact on mortality. Milan was the city with the greatest differences in mean MAT between airport and city stations, and the overall risk of dying was greater when airport MAT (+47% increase, 95%CI 38-57) was considered in comparison to city MAT (+37% increase, 95%CI 30-45). In Rome and Turin, the results were very similar for both apparent temperature measures. In all cities, the elderly, women and subjects with previous psychiatric conditions, depression, heart and circulation disorders and cerebrovascular disease were at higher risk of dying during hot days, and the degree of effect modification was similar using airport or city-centre MAT. Studies on the impact of meteorological variables on mortality, or other health indicators, need to account for the possible differences between airport and city centre meteorological variables in order to give more accurate estimates of health effects.},

However, standard cognitive assessments are not diagnostically sensitive and are performed infrequently. To address these issues, we have developed a set of adaptive computer games to monitor cognitive performance in a home environment. Assessment algorithms for various aspects of cognition are embedded in the games. The monitoring of these metrics allows us to detect within subject trends over time, providing a method for the early detection of cognitive decline. In addition, the real-time information on cognitive state is used to adapt the user interface to the needs of the individual user.

We further studied associations between fractions of PM(10) assigned to six sources (biomass, secondary, oil, crustal, sea salt, and vehicle) and admissions during a 1(1/2) -year campaign. We used Poisson generalized additive time-series model adjusted for season, day of the week, public holidays, influenza epidemics, grass pollen, school holidays, and meteorology, with up to 5 days lagged air pollution exposure. We found positive associations between PM(10) and the three health outcomes, with strongest associations for asthma. The PM(10) effect remained robust in the presence of CO and NO(2). We found different PM(10) sources to be variably associated with different outcomes: crustal and secondary sources showed strongest associations with cardiovascular, biomass with respiratory, and vehicle with asthma admissions. These novel results may merit future research of potential mechanism, whereas at present, no single PM(10) source can be attributed to all morbidity.},

    abstract = {In light of future challenges, such as growing numbers of elderly, increase in chronic diseases, insufficient health care budgets and problems with staff recruitment for the health-care sector, information and communication technology (ICT) becomes a possible means to meet these challenges. Organizational changes such as the decentralization of the health-care system lead to a shift from in-hospital to both advanced and basic home health care. Advanced medical technologies provide solutions for distant home care in form of specialist consultations and home monitoring. Furthermore, the shift towards home health care will increase mobile work and the establishment of shared care teams which require ICT-based solutions that support ubiquitous information access and cooperative work. Clinical documentation and decision support systems are the main ICT-based solutions of interest in the context of ubiquitous computing for shared care environments. This paper therefore describes the prerequisites for clinical documentation and decision support at the point of care, the impact of mobility on the documentation process, and how the introduction of ICT-based solutions will influence organizations and people. Furthermore, the role of dentistry in shared-care environments is discussed and illustrated in the form of a future scenario.},

We hypothesized that freshly generated ultrafine particles (UFP) contribute to these effects, as they are present in high number concentrations on highways and vehicle passengers are exposed directly to them. Aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (9-12 mo) with implanted radiotelemetry devices were exposed to highway aerosol or filtered, gas-denuded (clean) air using an on-road exposure system to examine effects on heart rate (HR) and heart-rate variability (HRV). On the day of exposure, rats were pretreated with low-dose inhaled or injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate respiratory tract or systemic inflammation, respectively. Exposures (6 h) in compartmentalized whole-body chambers were performed in an air conditioned compartment of a mobile laboratory on I-90 between Rochester and Buffalo, NY. HRV parameters were calculated from telemetric blood pressure signals and analyzed for the baseline period and for the first 32 h postexposure. The aerosol size (count median diameter = 15-20 nm; geometric standard deviation = 1.4-4.3) and number concentration (1.95-5.62 x 105/cm3) indicated the predominance of UFP. Intraperitoneal LPS significantly affected all of the parameters in a time-dependent manner; response patterns after inhaled or injected LPS pretreatment were similar, but more prolonged and greater in LPS-injected rats. A significant effect of highway aerosol was found, irrespective of pretreatment, which resulted in decreased HR in comparison to clean air-exposed rats. This effect was more persistent ( approximately 14 h) in those rats that received ip LPS as compared to saline. The highway aerosol also significantly affected short-term alterations in autonomic control of HR, as evidenced by elevations in normalized high frequency power and decreased vagosympathetic balance. These findings show that environmental exposure concentrations of mixed traffic-related UFP/gas-phase emissions can affect the autonomic nervous system.},

This paper offers a basis for a radically revised model that combines end-to-end service processes optimization; the use of integrated assistive technology systems to help the elderly maintain an independent lifestyle; personal risk reduction through medical and status monitoring; extended care-watch and service co-ordination. It then develops an IPTV based approach to provide the necessary infrastructure to underpin provision of these facilities both at home and in the community. These substantial benefits are reviewed and weighed against the inherent loss of privacy that can result from the pervasive computing aspects of the care watch approach, together with the trust building and change management aspects that are inevitably involved in the rationalisation process.},

All these aspects are typically emphasized within the elderly population, with very frequent hospital admissions and a significant increase of medical costs. Recent studies and experiences have demonstrated that accurate heart failure management programs, based on a suitable integration of inpatient and outpatient clinical procedures, might prevent and reduce hospital admissions, improving clinical status and reducing costs. HEARTFAID aims at defining efficient and effective health care delivery organization and management models for the "optimal" management of the care in the field of cardiovascular diseases. The HEARTFAID innovative computerized system will improve the processes of diagnosis, prognosis and therapy provision, providing the following services: * electronic health record for easy and ubiquitous access to heterogeneous patients data;* integrated services for healthcare professionals, including patient telemonitoring, signal and image processing, alert and alarm system;* clinical decision support in the heart failure domain, based on pattern recognition in historical data, knowledge discovery analysis and inferences on patients' clinical data.The formalization of the pre-existing clinical knowledge and the discovery of new elicited knowledge represent the core of the HEARTFAID platform.},

He is perhaps best known for his pioneering contributions to organization and management theory. March's accomplishments in that field, and in many others, have conferred on him an almost unprecedented reputation as a rigorous scholar and a deep source of wisdom. As University of Chicago professor John Padgett wrote in the journal Contemporary Sociology, "March's influence, unlike that of any of his peers, is not limited to any possible subset of the social science disciplines; it is pervasive." March approaches thought aesthetically; he cares that ideas have "some form of elegance or grace or surprise." His poetic sensibility can be felt in the metaphors he has created over the years--the "garbage can theory" of organizational choice, for instance, and the "hot-stove effect" in learning. In this edited interview with HBR senior editor Diane Coutu, March shares his thinking on aesthetics, leadership, the role of folly, and the irrelevance of relevance when it comes to the pursuit of ideas.

Washington, DC has long been considered a non-healthy place to live according to the American Lung Association due to its poor air quality. This recognition clearly includes the negative PM-related human health effects within the region. Specifically, DC fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microm] poses notable health risks to subpopulations having an annual mean value of 16.70 microg/m(3) during the years 1999-2004, exceeding the EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 15 microg/m(3). Incessant exposure to significant levels of PM has previously been linked to deleterious health effects, such as heart and lung diseases. The environmental quality and public health statistics of Washington, DC indicate the need for higher-resolution measurements of emissions, both spatially and temporally, and increased analysis of PM-related health effects. Our findings show that there are significant risks of ward-specific pediatric asthma emergency room visits (ERV). Results also illustrate lifetime excess lung cancer risks, exceeding the 1 x 10(-6) threshold for the measured levels of particulate matter and heavy metals (chromium and arsenic) on behalf of numerous subpopulations in the DC selected wards.},

We collected daily outdoor PM2.5 samples between autumn 1998 and spring 1999 in Helsinki, Finland. The mass of PM2.5 was apportioned between five sources. Forty-five elderly nonsmoking persons with stable coronary heart disease visited a clinic biweekly for submaximal exercise testing, during which the occurrence of ST segment depressions was recorded. Levels of PM2.5 originating from local traffic and long-range transport were associated with ST segment depressions>0.1 mV, with odds ratios at 2-day lag of 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.97] and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.20) per 1 microg/m3, respectively. In multipollutant models, where we used indicator elements for sources instead of source-specific PM2.5, only absorbance (elemental carbon), an indicator of local traffic and other combustion, was associated with ST segment depressions.

    abstract = {Inhaled aerosol drugs commonly used by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators, as well as corticosteroids. These agents are available in a variety of inhaler devices, which include metered-dose inhalers (MDI), breath-actuated MDIs, nebulizers, and, currently, 5 different models of dry powder inhaler (DPI). There is evidence to suggest that multiple inhaler types cause confusion among patients and increase errors in patient use. Problems with MDIs include failure to coordinate inhalation with actuation of the MDI, inadequate breath-hold, and inappropriately fast inspiratory flow. Lack of a dose counter makes determining the number of remaining doses in an MDI problematic. Patient misuse of MDIs is compounded by lack of knowledge of correct use among health-care professionals. Several factors often seen with elderly patients have been identified as predictive of incorrect use of MDIs. These include mental-state scores, hand strength, and ideomotor dyspraxia. Holding chambers and spacers are partially intended to reduce the need for inhalation-actuation coordination with MDI use. However, such add-on devices can be subject to incorrect assembly. Possible delays between MDI actuation and inhalation, rapid inspiration, chamber electrostatic charge, and firing multiple puffs into the chamber can all reduce the availability of inhaled drug. Because they are breath-actuated, DPIs remove the need for inhalation-actuation synchrony, but there is evidence that patient errors in use of DPIs may be similar to those with MDIs. One of the biggest problems is loading and priming the DPI for use, and this may be due to the fact that every DPI model in current use is different. Medical personnel's knowledge of correct DPI use has also been shown to be lacking. The optimum inhalation profiles are different for the various DPIs, but, generally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients have been shown to achieve a minimum therapeutic dose, although the inhaled amount may be suboptimal. A limitation of DPIs that have multidose powder reservoirs (eg, the Turbuhaler) is ambient humidity, which can reduce the released dose. Small-volume nebulizers are limited by bulk, treatment time, and variable performance, but are easy for patients to use. Important features identified by patients for an ideal inhaler are ease of use during an attack, dose counter, and general ease of use and learning. A breath-actuated-pMDI, such as the Autohaler, ranked at the top of inhaler preference in a study of 100 patients with airflow obstruction, compared to DPIs and MDIs. Short of a universal simple inhaler, patient and caregiver education remains the best solution to correct patient errors in use.},

Some epidemiologic studies have shown the association to be stronger with PM less than 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) than with PM less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10). Some scientists and regulators suggest that 2.5 microm might be an arbitrary cutoff and that the effects might be more pronounced for PM less than 0.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter (ultrafine PM). Our first aim was to determine the relation between size of respirable particles and particle toxicity, as well as the health effects of short-term increases (spikes) in particle concentration against backgrounds of relatively low or high baseline exposures. Our second aim was to determine the effect of spikes in concentration of fine particles (0.7 microm in mass median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD]) and ultrafine particles (35 nm in count median diameter [CMD]) of disparate composition: vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and carbon black. The relative toxicity of these particles was determined in aged rats with mild pulmonary inflammation induced by instilled endotoxin. Our third aim was to determine the influence of age (aged vs young adult) on particle-induced toxicity in these rats.},

    abstract = {Fine particulate air pollution has been associated with increases in long-term mortality in selected cohort studies, and this association has been influential in the establishment of air quality regulations for fine particles (PM(2.5)). However, this epidemiologic evidence has been questioned because of methodological issues, conflicting findings, and lack of an accepted causal mechanism. To further evaluate this association, the long-term relation between fine particulate air pollution and total mortality was examined in a cohort of 49, 975 elderly Californians, with a mean age of 65 yr as of 1973. These subjects, who resided in 25 California counties, were enrolled in 1959, recontacted in 1972, and followed from 1973 through 2002; 39, 846 deaths were identified. Proportional hazards regression models were used to determine their relative risk of death (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) during 1973-2002 by county of residence. The models adjusted for age, sex, cigarette smoking, race, education, marital status, body mass index, occupational exposure, exercise, and a dietary factor. For the 35, 789 subjects residing in 11 of these counties, county-wide exposure to fine particles was estimated from outdoor ambient concentrations measured during 1979-1983 and RRs were calculated as a function of these PM(2.5) levels (mean of 23.4 microg/m(3)). For the initial period, 1973-1982, a small positive risk was found: RR was 1.04 (1.01-1.07) for a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM(2.5). For the subsequent period, 1983-2002, this risk was no longer present: RR was 1.00 (0.98-1.02). For the entire follow-up period, RR was 1.01 (0.99-1.03). The RRs varied somewhat among major subgroups defined by sex, age, education level, smoking status, and health status. None of the subgroups that had significantly elevated RRs during 1973-1982 had significantly elevated RRs during 1983-2002. The RRs showed no substantial variation by county of residence during any of the three follow-up periods. Subjects in the two counties with the highest PM(2.5) levels (mean of 36.1 microg/m(3)) had no greater risk of death than those in the two counties with the lowest PM(2.5) levels (mean of 13.1 microg/m(3)). These epidemiologic results do not support a current relationship between fine particulate pollution and total mortality in elderly Californians, but they do not rule out a small effect, particularly before 1983.},

    abstract = {There has been increasing awareness in recent years of the adverse cardiovascular effects of ambient air pollution. The recent publication of a statement from the Expert Panel on Population and Prevention Science of the American Heart Association has highlighted this issue. It has been appreciated for several decades that major pollution episodes, such as that associated with the London Fog of 1952, are responsible for increased numbers of deaths and most of these are due to cardiorespiratory causes. Realisation of this prompted government and environmental health initiatives to reduce emissions through establishing air quality standards. Previously, the major sources of air pollution were related to domestic coal burning and industry. However, the pattern of emissions in modern developed countries has changed, resulting in a pollution mixture of different composition to that on which early air quality standards were based. Even current 'lower' levels of air pollution have been shown consistently to be associated with adverse health effects. Over the past two decades, a wealth of epidemiological studies have considered both long- and short-term health effects of air pollution. Although the relative risk of respiratory disease in relation to air pollution exposure seems to be higher than that of cardiovascular disease, the latter are of greater absolute significance in population terms. A number of hypotheses have been proposed in order to explain the observed associations, and recent research efforts have focused on examining the mechanisms underlying the effects. It is suggested that certain subgroups of the population such as the elderly or those with pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease may be more susceptible to the effects of air pollution, and analysis of survival data from cohort studies supports this observation.},

Under the European Union 5th Framework Programme (FP5), the HEPMEAP, RAIAP and PAMCHAR projects have utilised high-volume samplers to collect PM in European locations with contrasting PM sources and performed a range of different laboratory investigations. The PM investigated generally induced significant biological responses, with both coarse (2.5-10 microm) and fine (0.1-2.5 microm) PM being able to induce toxic effects. The chemical composition of the PM (also reflecting the differences in the emission-source contribution) has been suggested to play an important role in these responses. Oxidative and immune effects have been demonstrated in several in vitro and animal models. Investigations have also given support for the assumption that asthmatic and elderly subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be more susceptible to PM exposure.},

Recent studies have shown that an increase in particulate matter (PM)(2.5) ambient concentrations was associated with a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) in the elderly with cardiovascular conditions, which could increase the risk of death. In order to assess if this association could also be observed in young adults, we studied 40 young healthy residents of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) who underwent 13 h Holter electrocardiographic and PM(2.5) personal monitoring. HRV was evaluated in time domain: the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals larger than 50 ms (pNN50). In multivariate analysis with mixed effects models, a significant negative association of pNN50 with PM(2.5) accumulative exposure was found. An increase in 30 microg/m(3) of the average PM(2.5) personal exposure in the previous 2 h decreased the pNN50 in 0.08% (P=0.01). This observation revealed an acute effect related to environmental exposure to PM(2.5) with regard to HRV in normal youngsters. The long-term health consequences of this association in young healthy adults remain to be clarified.},

Understanding the scale of susceptibility in relation to the stringency or protectiveness of PM standards is important to achieving the public health protection required by the Clean Air Act of 1970. Evaluative tools are therefore necessary to place into regulatory context available health and monitoring data appropriate to the current review of the PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Within the New England, New Jersey, and New York study area, 38% of the total population are < 18 or > or =65 years of age, 4-18% of adults have cardiopulmonary or diabetes health conditions, 12-15% of children have respiratory allergies or lifetime asthma, and 72% of all persons (across child, adult, and elderly age groups) live in densely populated urban areas with elevated PM2.5 concentrations likely creating heightened exposure scenarios. The analysis combined a number of data sets to show that compliance with a range of alternative annual and 24-hr PM2.5 standard groupings would affect a large fraction of the total population in the Northeast. This work finds that current PM2.5 standards in the eight-state study area affect only 16% of the general population, who live in counties that do not meet the existing annual/24-hr standard of 15/65 microg/m3. More protective PM2.5 standards recommended or enacted by California and Canada would protect 84-100% of the Northeast population. Standards falling within current ranges recommended by the U.S. EPA would protect 29-100% of the Northeast population. These considerations suggest that the size of general and susceptible populations affected by the stringency of alternative PM standards has broad implications for risk management and direct bearing on the U.S. EPA's current NAAQS review and implementation.},

However, relationships between such environmental factors and the daily physical activity of older populations remain unclear. The present study thus examined associations between meteorological variables and the number of steps taken per day by elderly Japanese. Continuous pedometer counts over a 450-day period were collected from 41 healthy subjects (age 71+/-4 years), none of whom engaged in any specific occupational activity or exercise programs. An electronic physical activity monitor was attached to a belt worn on the left side of the body throughout the day. Daily values for mean ambient temperature, duration of bright sunshine, mean wind speed, mean relative humidity, and precipitation were obtained from local meteorological stations. The day length was calculated from times of sunrise and sunset. Based on the entire group of 41 subjects (ensemble average), a subject's step count per day decreased exponentially with increasing precipitation (r2=0.19, P<0.05). On days when precipitation was <1 mm, the step count increased with the mean ambient temperature over the range of -2 to 17 degrees C, but decreased over the range 17-29 degrees C. The daily step count also tended to increase with day length, but the regression coefficient of determination attributable to step count and mean ambient temperature (r2=0.32, P<0.05) exceeded that linking the step count and day length (r2=0.13, P<0.05). The influence of other meteorological factors was small (r2<or=0.03) and of little practical significance. On days when precipitation is <1 mm, physical activity is associated more strongly with ambient temperature than with day length, duration of bright sunshine, wind speed, or relative humidity. Our findings have practical implications for health promotion efforts designed to increase the physical activity of elderly people consistently in the face of seasonal variations in environmental conditions.},

We evaluated short-term health responses of 13 elderly volunteers with COPD and 6 age-matched healthy adults to controlled exposures of ambient PM pollution in suburban Los Angeles. Using a Harvard particle concentrator and a whole-body chamber, we exposed each person on separate occasions to approximately 200 microg/m(3) concentrated ambient particles (CAP) less than 2.5 mum in diameter and to filtered air (FA). Each exposure lasted 2 h with intermittent mild exercise. We found no significant effects of CAP on symptoms, spirometry, or induced sputum. A significant negative effect of CAP on arterial oxygenation (measured by pulse oximetry) immediately postexposure was more pronounced in healthy subjects. Peripheral blood basophils increased after CAP in healthy but not in COPD subjects. In both groups, red cell counts increased slightly 1 day after exposure to FA but not to CAP. Preexposure ectopic heartbeats were infrequent in healthy subjects, but increased modestly during/after CAP exposure relative to FA. Ectopic beats were more frequent in COPD subjects, but decreased modestly during/after CAP relative to FA. Heart-rate variability over multi-hour intervals was lower after CAP than after FA in healthy elderly subjects but not in COPD subjects. Thus, in this initial small-scale study of older volunteers experimentally exposed to ambient PM, some acute cardiopulmonary responses were consistent with effects reported from epidemiologic studies. Unexpectedly, individuals with COPD appeared less susceptible than healthy elderly individuals. Further investigation of older adults is warranted to understand the pathophysiology and public health significance of these findings.},

Ageing male golfers (N = 34; Age: M = 68.7, SD = 5.4 years) completed a mood measure immediately before and after an 18-hole round of golf. Distance walked per game was measured using a pedometer. Results indicate reported scores on Anger, Depression, and Fatigue increased and Vigor reduced following the game. However, it should be noted that although there was an increase in unpleasant mood states, this should be seen in the context of the overall mood profile, which was positive. Pedometer results indicated golfers walked a mean distance of 10.21 km (± 1.11). Results show participants of this age-group engaged in a meaningful exercise session and that mood scores deteriorated following play. Findings from the present study show that elderly golfers experienced mood profiles following golf similar to younger athletes following competition. For golf to be recommended as an activity for promoting physical activity among an aging population, the player's ability to regulate unpleasant mood states should be considered.

The ongoing Swedish research project "Technical support for Mobile CloseCare" focuses on the development and evaluation of work-scenario oriented ICT support for enhanced home care of elderly citizens. The aim of the project is to provide a seamless and consistent information flow between different health care providers and to give intuitive access to information services for the elderly and their relatives. For that purpose, different independent software components are connected through a mobile communication platform. Flexible access to prioritized information for different users in different work situations will be given through a virtual health record. In order to obtain both usable and clinically relevant results, a user centered system development approach is followed. Evaluation of the project results will be based on usability tests and quasi-experimental studies on how system implementation influences quality of care and job- and life satisfaction for care providers, patients and relatives.},

However, the pervasive societal impression of immediate gratification has led to a widespread recognition of "life saving" only in circumstances of immediate danger. The lengthening national life expectancy is not accorded respect as an accomplishment in and of itself. Families of dying, elderly persons still mistake the "loss" by failing to appreciate the many times this life has been saved and esteeming the accomplishment that death at a later age poses. Public health and preventive medicine both suffer general disregard for this shortsighted perspective, from the public and those who determine federal funding priorities. This narrative expounds on this frustration and describes its implication for the future of public health as it is currently practiced in this nation.},

    abstract = {Ambient particulate pollution is associated with adverse health effects in epidemiological studies of the elderly with cardiopulmonary diseases. We hypothesize that ultrafine particles (UFP) contribute to these effects, especially when they are freshly generated and occur at high number concentrations. Studies to determine adverse effects have been performed using laboratory-generated surrogates, diluted exhaust from stationary engines, or concentrated ambient UFPs. Methodological difficulties exist with such experiments, and questions remain about how well these particles model those found in ambient air. Freshly generated UFPs are present at high concentrations on highways and vehicle passengers are directly exposed to them. We wished to expose rats to these UFPs to test their potential to cause effects. Since such exposures have not been done before, one objective of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of an on-road exposure study. Secondly, we wished to determine if there are significant exposure-related effects in aged, compromised rats. Old rats (21-mo F-344) were exposed directly on highways to either the aerosol (<1 microm)/gas phase, gas phase only, or filtered air using an on-road exposure system. Some rats were pretreated with a low dose of inhaled endotoxin or with instilled influenza virus to induce lung inflammation. The exposures in compartmentalized whole-body chambers consisted of 6-h driving periods on I-90 between Rochester and Buffalo once or 3 days in a row. Endpoints related to lung inflammation, inflammatory cell activation, and acute-phase responses were measured after exposure. The on-road exposure system did not affect measured endpoints in filtered air-exposed rats, indicating that it was well tolerated by them. We observed the expected increases in response (inflammation, inflammatory cell activation) to the priming agents. We also found a significant particle-associated increase in plasma endothelin-2, suggesting alterations in vascular endothelial cell activation. In addition, we observed main effects of particles related to the acute-phase response and inflammatory-cell activation. Interactions between on-road particles and the priming agents were also found. These results suggest that exposures to on-road particle mixtures have effects on the pulmonary and cardiovascular system in compromised, old rats. Furthermore, they demonstrate that on-road exposures are feasible and could be performed in future studies with more continuous particle exposures.},

The Schwartz Center is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting and advancing compassionate health care delivery, which provides hope to the patient and support to caregivers, and encourages the healing process. The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Ageism is a pervasive problem throughout society. It is rooted in language, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and policies. Aging profoundly influences physiology, challenging the medical community to accommodate but not discriminate. The elderly are at an increased risk of disease and disability. Sixty percent of cancer occurs in people aged 65 and older, and the population is aging. The treatment of cancer in the elderly is complicated by comorbidities and other physiological factors, particularly renal, bone marrow, and metabolic reserve. Caregivers have to treat patients in a manner that optimizes treatment and avoids anticipated harm. However, the caregiver is often faced with situations where they must balance their personal beliefs, professional values, and knowledge of medicine with their patients' preferences and needs. Discussion in the Rounds focused on age bias, drug toxicity, life prolongation, and symptom relief, with the role of the caregiver, and the relationship to the patient, being pivotal.},

The study setting was metropolitan Mexico City, a high altitude city situated in a valley, with an estimated 20 million inhabitants, large socioeconomic gradients, and ozone levels frequently exceeding international standards. We stratified daily deaths by six census-derived socioeconomic indicators, based on characteristics of the county where decedents lived. We used Poisson regression to model the association between daily mortality and ozone levels (on the day of death and the previous day) in separate models, stratified by area socioeconomic level and age, and controlling for time trends and temperature. Ozone was positively associated with total mortality [0.65% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02%, 1.28%] and for mortality among those over age 65 [1.39% increase per 10 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.51%, 2.28%]. Associations between ozone and all-age mortality did not show any consistent patterns according to socioeconomic gradients. We conclude that elderly people are at higher risk for ozone-associated mortality. Though county-level social indicators in Mexico City were not strong markers of vulnerability to ozone-associated acute mortality in this analysis, complex associations between individual and area-level factors may exist that would require additional data and further analyses to elucidate.},

The present study was conducted to determine whether frail elderly persons with fear of falling have lower physical function. A total of 47 subjects (aged 73 to 95) were recruited from a geriatric health services facility in Osaka. Physical function including balance, mobility, and muscular strength were measured using the following tests: Timed up & go test (TUG), functional reach test, single limb stance with eyes open, ten-meter walk, and knee extensor strength. Twenty-nine subjects (62%) had fear of falling and 18 (38%) had no fear of falling. There was no significant difference in age, sex, or the proportion using assistive devices. Results from the statistical tests showed that there were no differences in physical function, except in the functional reach test. The ratio of TUG to 10 m walk was used to determine the association between balance and mobility. In frail elderly persons with fear of falling and in those without fear of falling, the means of the ratios were 1.20 (SD=0.27) and 1.03 (SD=0.16), respectively. The ratios for frail elderly persons with fear of falling were higher (p=0.024) than the frail elderly without fear of falling. Our study suggests that even if frail elderly individuals walk slowly, they are not afraid of falling if there is a feasible balance function. We conclude that, in low-functioning frail elderly, fear of falling is associated with a combination of balance function and gait speed.},

We then compared these exposures with concurrent data on the number of daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases in men and women > 65 years of age. Generalized linear models, assuming a Poisson error structure for the selected cardiovascular disease hospital admissions, were constructed to evaluate the associations with air pollution and temperature. After adjusting the admission data for yearly trends, day-of-week effects, ambient maximum temperature, and dew point temperature, we studied the associations of the pollutants in single-pollutant models with lag times of 0-4 days. The results suggest that O3 is associated with an increase in the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, and pulmonary heart disease. SO2 appears to be related to increased hospital stays for cardiac dysrhythmias, and CO is significantly associated with congestive heart failure. No association was found between particulate matter or NO2 and any of the health outcomes. Males tend to have higher numbers of hospital admissions than do females for all of the selected cardiovascular diseases, except for congestive heart failure. Higher temperatures appear to be an important factor in increasing the frequency of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, and are associated with a decrease in the frequency of visits for coronary atherosclerosis and pulmonary heart disease.},

    abstract = {Several recent epidemiologic studies investigating the short-term effects of particulate matter (PM) concentrations have shown carbon monoxide (CO) to have the strongest and most consistent statistical relationship with hospital admissions for cardiac diseases. This article suggests a potential hypothesis for these epidemiologic observations. Oxygen (O2) is transported, in reversible combination with hemoglobin, from the lungs to the tissues, where it diffuses into cardiac myocytes. Within the myocyte a portion of the O2 diffuses directly to the mitochondria, while the remaining O2 is transported by facilitated diffusion bound to myoglobin, a heme protein found in muscle. Within the mitochondria, O2 reacts to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high-energy phosphate compound that provides energy for all cell functions. Accordingly, the sustained production of ATP depends on the continuous delivery of O2 to the mitochondria, and failure at any point in the O2 transport system will compromise ATP production and myocardial function. Myoglobin, a fundamental constituent of cardiac muscle is essential for delivering O2 to the mitochondria. Myoglobin concentrations in cardiac tissue were 50% lower in patients with heart failure than in patients dying from noncardiac causes. Myoglobin concentrations are also severely depressed in animal models of congestive heart failure. Consequently, the role of myoglobin as a cellular transporter of O2 is seriously impaired by heart disease. Carbon monoxide reduces O2 transport to the tissues and, within the tissues, binds with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin (COMb). Thus, in cardiac patients CO further exacerbates the disease-related loss of myoglobin function. This further disrupts O2 transport and promotes adverse consequences for the compromised heart. Moreover, during hypoxia CO has the propensity of leaving the blood and binding with myoglobin in the intracellular compartment. Elderly persons with preexisting cardiopulmonary disorders appear to be at maximum risk of harmful health effects due to ambient air pollution exposure. Many of these disorders result in generalized or regional hypoxia. It is reasonable to hypothesize that CO also moves out of the blood of these patients and into the heart tissue whenever they are under hypoxic stress, such as exercise. Accordingly, CO binds with the marginal myoglobin concentrations present in the hearts of cardiac patients and further compromises cardiac function, resulting in poor tolerance of activity. Therefore, reduced cardiac myoglobin in people with heart disease, further exacerbated by CO moving into the cardiac tissue during episodes of hypoxia, may account for the positive association between ambient CO concentrations and hospitalization for heart disease.},

Elderly people appear to be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects involving the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, resulting in symptoms, exacerbations of disease and even mortality. From an epidemiological point of view it is essential to obtain a more detailed description and identification of factors associated with these health effects. Novel study designs are needed with complementary exposure and biomedical characterisation. Long-term prospective studies are required. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms is considered important and requires an interaction between epidemiological and mechanistic studies in elderly individuals with or without complementary diseases that put in them especially at risk. Generally a synergy between complementary disciplines is warranted to move this important research area forward, also including in vitro models of cell responses in the elderly, animal models of diseases of the elderly, together with controlled air pollution exposure studies identifying health-related events and mechanisms. The generation of an understanding of air pollution effects in the elderly, at an elevated level, is a prerequisite to substantially reducing the adverse health effects of this population group. At local, national and European Union levels, some steps have been taken to support the research in this area. A major focus on the adverse air pollution effects in the elderly requires a long-term commitment that still remains to be established.},

Daily measurements for particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM10) and black smoke (BS), as well as the daily number of deaths among persons > or = 65 yrs of age, from 29 European cities, have been collected. Data on other pollutants and meteorological variables, to adjust for confounding effects and data on city characteristics, to investigate potential effect modification, were also recorded. For individual city analysis, generalised additive models extending Poisson regression, using a locally weighted regression (LOESS) smoother to control for seasonal effects, were applied. To combine individual city results and explore effect modification, second stage regression models were applied. The per cent increase (95% confidence intervals), associated with a 10 microg x m(-3) increase in PM10, in the elderly daily number of deaths was 0.8%, (0.7-0.9%) and the corresponding number for BS was 0.6%, (0.5-0.8%). The effect size was modified by the long-term average levels of nitrogen dioxide (higher levels were associated with larger effects), temperature (larger effects were observed in warmer countries), and by the proportion of the elderly in each city (a larger proportion was associated with higher effects). These results indicate that ambient particles have effects on mortality among the elderly, with relative risks comparable or slightly higher than those observed for total mortality and similar effect modification patterns. The effects among the older persons are of particular importance, since the attributable number of events will be much larger, compared to the number of deaths among the younger population.},

    abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are responsible for around 20% of all deaths worldwide (approximately 14 million) and are the principal cause of death in all developed countries, accounting for 50% of all deaths. Variations in the annual per capita death rates in different countries are well documented. Less well known are seasonal variations in death rates, with the highest levels occurring during the colder winter months, which have been described in many countries. This phenomenon is referred to as excess winter mortality. CVD-related deaths account for the majority of excess winter deaths (up to 70% in some countries), while about half of the remaining are due to increases in respiratory diseases. Paradoxically, CVD mortality increases to a greater extent with a given fall in temperature in regions with warm winters. While much of the indirect evidence points to the notion that cold is somehow involved in explaining excess winter deaths, the mechanism by which seemingly mild exposure to cold ambient conditions can increase the risk of death remains unclear. The strong indirect epidemiological evidence coupling cold climate to mortality may be related to indoor rather than outdoor climatic conditions (e.g., cold/damp houses versus warm/dry houses) coupled with a plethora of factors including health status, ageing-related deterioration in physiological and behavioral thermoregulation, toxicology, and socioeconomic factors.},

At each study center, a panel of elderly subjects with coronary heart disease recorded cardiac and respiratory symptoms in a diary. Exposure to ambient air pollution was characterized by measuring daily mass concentrations of particles smaller than 10 micro m (PM(10)) and 2.5 micro m (PM(2.5)), number concentrations of ultrafine particles (NC(0.01-0.1)), and gases. Odds ratios for the relation of symptoms to air pollution, adjusted for time trend, respiratory infections, and meteorologic variables, were mostly homogeneous across the centers. No association was found between air pollution and chest pain. A 10- micro g/m(3) increase in PM(2.5) was positively associated with the incidence of shortness of breath (odds ratio (OR) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.24) and with avoidance of activities (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.22).

    abstract = {Stereotypes of an asexual old age remain pervasive, shaping not only popular images of older people, but also research and policy agendas. However, older people's own attitudes towards the role and value of sex in later life remain relatively unexplored. This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative data to examine how sex is prioritised in middle age and later life. Data collection methods involved completion of two quality of life measures (WHOQOL-100 and WHOQOL Importance Scale), followed by semi-structured interviews. In total the sample comprised 69 individuals recruited from the age/sex register of a general practice in Sheffield in the UK. This paper will focus upon the accounts of 21 men and 23 women aged 50-92 years. Ratings of the importance of sex to participants were gathered from the WHOQOL Importance Scale; the in-depth interviews enabled the basis for this prioritisation to be explored. Analysis identified the following key themes. Participants who did not consider sex to be of any importance to them neither had a current sexual partner, nor felt that they would have another sexual partner in their lifetime. Indeed, all participants who had a current sexual partner attributed at least some importance to sex, with many rating sex as 'very' or 'extremely' important. However, experiencing barriers to being sexually active led them to place less importance on sex; this was particularly apparent when health problems and widowhood were experienced. Age was seen as facilitating coping when sex became less frequent, or stopped altogether. This was explained in terms of sexual desire decreasing with age (for some male participants), the cessation of sex being easier to cope with in a relationship of long duration and the expectation that sex will become less possible with 'normal ageing'. The discussion considers the implications of these findings for this developing field.},

The average age of the (mostly female) respondents was 45.9 years; 23.8% were elderly. Among the 7324 individuals who completed the survey, 77.6% selected an oral product; 22.4% preferred rectal administration.

Only 59.8% of respondents used these drugs correctly, and 58.2% consulted a physician or pharmacist because of constipation. Adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, occurred in 6.1% of those surveyed. The long-term use or abuse of laxatives can cause serious medical consequences, as well as mask diseases, delaying diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Physicians, pharmacists, and other health-care personnel should counsel patients on the proper use of these easily available, ubiquitous drugs.},

Nevertheless, few studies document the efficacy of primary prevention efforts in preventing depressive disorders in the elderly. The author argues that the attainment of positive mental health depends in considerable part upon an individual's self-efficacy--the belief that one can organize and execute the courses of action required to develop and enhance a person's belief that he or she can act in ways that lead to a desired goal. Self-efficacy is strengthened, not by some general or abstract instruction, but rather by the experience of successfully dealing with and thus overcoming specific problems. The extant literature suggests that many potential approaches may be available to develop and enhance self-efficacy in the elderly--approaches that potentially could be broadly applicable in community settings.},

Part IV of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995), as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (2001), identifies such statutory duties and rights for nursing programs. For the purpose of this article, access to nursing education by disabled students and the subsequent service provision for these students in nursing programs is described as a game, using a conceptual framework by North. Different roles identified within the formal and informal legal rules, such as attitudes toward disabled students in nursing programs throughout the UK, are discussed briefly using this framework. It is noted that the rules of the game very much mirror the rules under Part II and Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) relating to disabled employees and disabled service users of public services, in force since December 1996. It is argued that lecturers and senior management teams in both nursing education and the health services occupy historical roles in the efficient design and playing of this game. The next step is to gradually align informal rules with formal rules, which can only be done through proper and correct education of key players.},

The presence of waterborne enteric pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) in domestic water supplies represents a potentially significant human health risk. Even though major outbreaks of waterborne disease are comparatively rare, there is substantial evidence that human enteric pathogens that are frequently present in domestic water supplies are responsible for low-level incidence of waterborne microbial disease. Although these diseases are rarely debilitating to healthy adults for more than a few hours to a few days, enteric pathogens can cause severe illness, even death, for young children, the elderly, or those with compromised immune systems. As the epidemiology of waterborne diseases is changing, there is a growing global public health concern about new and reemerging infectious diseases that are occurring through a complex interaction of social, economic, evolutionary, and ecological factors. New microbial pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. Alternative testing strategies for waterborne diseases should significantly improve the ability to detect and control the causative pathogenic agents. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of waterborne microbial pathogens, their detection, and the future of new methods in controlling these infectious agents.},

Data collected at outdoor sites at the homes of participants of a large exposure assessment study were used in this study. Harvard impactors (HIs) were used at 40 outdoor sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area. Up to six sites at a time were monitored for 10 consecutive 24-hr average periods. A fixed-effect analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included date and location effects was used to analyze the spatial variability of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Both date and location effects were shown to be highly significant, explaining 92% of the variability in outdoor PM2.5 measurements. The day-to-day variability was 10 times higher than the spatial variability between sites. The site mean square was more than twice the error mean square, showing that differences between sites, while modest, are potentially an important contribution to measurement error. Variances of the model residuals and site effects were examined against spatial characteristics of the monitoring sites. The spatial characteristics included elevation, distance from arterials, and distance from major PM2.5 point sources. Results showed that the most representative PM2.5 sites were located at elevations of 80-120 m above sea level, and at distances of 100-300 m from the nearest arterial road. Location relative to industrial PM2.5 sources is not a significant predictor of residential outdoor PM2.5 measurements. Additionally, for sites to be representative of the average population exposures to PM2.5 among those highly susceptible to the health effects of PM2.5, areas of high elderly population density were considered. These representative spatial characteristics were used as multiple, overlapping criteria in a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to determine where the most representative sites are located.},

In conclusion, excessive drinking is common in the elderly. Screening tests based on behavioral and biological markers identify two different sets of subjects with possible alcohol problems.

Although the components of air pollution that cause the adverse health effects in these individuals are unknown, a small proportion by mass but a large proportion by number of the ambient air particles are ultrafine, i.e., less than 100 nm in diameter. This ultrafine component of particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microm (PM(10) may mediate some of the adverse health effects reported in epidemiologic studies and for which there is toxicologic evidence to support this contention. The exact mechanism by which ultrafine particles have adverse effects is unknown, but these particles have recently been shown to enhance calcium influx on contact with macrophages. Oxidative stress is also to be anticipated at the huge particle surface; this can be augmented by oxidants generated by recruited inflammatory leukocytes. Atheromatous plaques form in the coronary arteries and are major causes of morbidity and death associated epidemiologically with particulate air pollution. In populations exposed to air pollution episodes, blood viscosity, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were higher. More recently, increases in heart rate in response to rising air pollution have been described and are most marked in individuals who have high blood viscosity. In our study of elderly individuals, there were significant rises in CRP, an index of inflammation.

This goal has not yet been achieved worldwide; however in England and Wales tetanus in neonates and young women has been extremely rare for the last 50 years. We can attribute the success in eliminating tetanus in the UK to the adoption of highly effective preventative measures as we know that the causative organism is still ubiquitous in the environment. This article outlines how we have achieved the elimination of tetanus in the UK through the development and introduction of appropriately targeted immunisation, combined with an appreciation of the importance of adequate wound toilet measures. The discovery of tetanus toxoid and its applicability for vaccination has been of great benefit and the new challenges which we face relate to the introduction of new multi-component vaccines and how we might better protect the elderly. In other parts of the world, for the cost of a few pence, one dose of tetanus toxoid can still mean the difference between life and death.},

We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 microg/m3 increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 microg/m3 in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics.},

In life and in death, health care costs are expensive, and while society often views older people as too expensive to take care of alive, their death can be even more costly. For patients of all ages, death under the influence of technology is more expensive than life, yet it is geriatric intensive care medicine that grabs society's economic attention.

As a part of those evaluations the experts also have to discuss the necessity of any kind of rehabilitation procedures. In 1999 according to the experts' opinion only about 12% of the patients need such special support. At first this number seems much too low. We discuss the problems in that social field: Does the demand of the social welfare legislation "prevention and rehabilitation instead of nursing care" not correspond to the real needs or are the circumstances of social policy and medical supply responsible for that low recommendation of rehabilitation programs. This discussion leads to the following consequences: The patients, the members of their family but also the treating physicians must be informed much better than today about diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for the special diseases of elderly people. All in the game have to prepare concepts, pilot projects and then common solutions for geriatric rehabilitation programs as soon as possible. Politicians, physicians, nursing staff, rehabilitation staff, patients, family members and any other caregivers all have to take responsibility, maybe the liability.

    abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine whether variations in concentrations of particulates in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, during the period 1984 to 1993, were associated with daily variations in cause-specific daily mortality. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfate was also measured daily (1986-1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec). We used coefficient of haze (COH), extinction coefficient, and sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine particles for days that were missing. We estimated associations between cause-specific mortality and PM(2.5), PM(10), predicted fine particles and fine sulfate particles, total suspended particles, coefficient of haze, extinction coefficient, and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station. We selected a set of underlying causes of death, as recorded on the death certificates, as the endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and gaseous pollutants. We found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from respiratory diseases and diabetes. The mean percentage change in daily mortality (MPC), evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day of death and the preceding 2 days, for deaths from respiratory diseases was MPC(COH)=6.90% (95% CI: 3.69-10.21%), MPC(Predicted PM2.5)= 9.03% (95% CI: 5.83- 12.33%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.64% (95% CI: 2.46-6.86%). For diabetes, the corresponding estimates were MPC(COH)=7.50% (95% CI: 1.96-13.34%), MPC(Predicted PM2.5)=7.59% (95% CI: 2.36-13.09%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.48% (95% CI: 1.08-7.99%). Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death, we found consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and coronary artery diseases. Associations with sulfate mass were also found among elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer. These associations were consistent with linear relationships. The associations found for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases, especially in the elderly, are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by which ambient particles may increase daily mortality. The positive associations found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis proposed by Frank and Tankersley, who suggested that persons in failing health may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating physiological set points. The association with diabetes may be interpreted in light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology. Further research to confirm these findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted.},

These studies have raised concerns about public health effects of particulate air pollution and have contributed to regulatory decisions in the United States. However, scientists have pointed out uncertainties that raise questions about the interpretation of these studies. One limitation to previous time-series studies of PM and adverse health effects is that the evidence for an association is derived from studies conducted in single locations using diverse analytic methods. Statistical procedures have been used to combine the results of these single location studies in order to produce a summary estimate of the health effects of PM. Difficulties with this approach include the process by which cities were selected to be studied, the different analytic methods applied to each single study, and the variety of methods used to measure or account for variables included in the analysis. These individual studies were also not able to account for the effects of gaseous air pollutants in a systematic manner.},

Despite the fact that epidemics could be predicted with regularity, the lack of available prevention or treatment measures left humankind vulnerable to the harmful effects of this ubiquitous virus. While the pandemics of 1918 and 1957 are recent examples of the devastation that influenza may inflict, even in a typical year influenza infection and related complications cause significant morbidity and mortality. The development of an influenza vaccine during the 1940s marked a major turning point in the management of this disease. Vaccination of the elderly and other high risk patients has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to be a worthwhile investment from an economic perspective. Despite these benefits, vaccine use in this group remains suboptimal. The role of annual vaccination for individuals at lower risk for influenza-related complications remains controversial. While prevention by vaccination is relatively straightforward, the treatment of symptomatic influenza-like illness with medication is more complicated. Differentiating symptoms caused by the influenza viruses from those caused by other common viruses is difficult. Currently available tests to document influenza as the cause of illness are either too expensive, too inaccurate or too time consuming to impact treatment. Symptom-based diagnosis remains the most commonly used strategy in clinical practice. The approval of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs)--zanamivir and oseltamivir--remind healthcare providers of the difficulties in diagnosing and treating influenza. NIs have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of individuals infected with influenza when prescribed within the first 2 days of symptoms. Whether these innovative agents are cost effective, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the benefits that these agents may offer above and beyond existing therapies. In this review, we examine the burden of influenza infection, diagnostic challenges and the clinical and economic impact of available interventions. Clinical controversies and potential areas for further investigation are also explored.},

The strongest associations are seen for respiratory and cardiac deaths, particularly among the elderly. Particulate air pollution is also associated with asthma exacerbations, increased respiratory symptoms, decreased lung function, increased medication use, and increased hospital admissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently promulgated a new national ambient air quality standard for fine particles, and yet the mechanisms for health effects at such low particle mass concentrations remain unclear. Hypotheses to identify the responsible particles have focused on particle acidity, particle content of transition metals, bioaerosols, and ultrafine particles. Because ultrafine particles are efficiently deposited in the respiratory tract and may be important in initiating airway inflammation, we have initiated clinical studies with ultrafine carbon particles in healthy subjects. These studies examine the role of ultrafines in: (1) the induction of airway inflammation; (2) expression of leukocyte and endothelial adhesion molecules in blood; (3) the alteration of blood coagulability; and (4) alteration in cardiac electrical activity. These events could lead to exacerbation of underlying cardiorespiratory disease. For example, airway inflammation may activate endothelium and circulating leukocytes, and induce a systemic acute phase response with transient hypercoagulability; this could explain the epidemiologic linkages between pollutant exposures and cardiovascular events. These approaches should be useful in identifying mechanisms for pollutant-induced respiratory and systemic effects, and in providing data for determining appropriate air quality standards.},

Contrary to earlier assumptions that ageing is a deficiency process, it has now been shown that despite evident losses in various life areas in aging, some resources can be defined which can be decisive for a sense of well-being among the elderly and for prophylaxis or therapy of old-age depression. Procedures and resource activation with content must be activated in parallel with problem actualization so that feelings of self-esteem and well-being increase, problems are solved and experiences of loss due to ageing are compensated. One of the most important resources among the elderly has proved to be the ability to accommodate and the social network.

A total of 325 PM2.5 personal exposure samples were obtained during a 28-day study period using a subject pool of 21 elderly (65+ years of age) residents of an 18-story retirement facility near Baltimore, Maryland. Each sample represented a unique 24-h breathing zone measurement of PM2.5 mass concentration. PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations collected from the apartments of the subjects as well as residential and ambient sites were compared to individual and mean PM2.5 personal exposures. Daily PM2.5 personal exposure concentrations ranged from 2.4 to 47.8 microg/m3 with an overall individual study mean of 12.9 microg/m3. Mean PM2.5 personal exposures were determined to be highly correlated to those representing the central indoor (r=0.90) and ambient sites (r=0.89). Subjects reported spending an average of 92% of each day within the confines of the retirement center. Based upon measured and modeled exposures, a mean PM2.5 personal cloud of 3.1 microg/m3 was estimated. Data collected from these participants may be unique with respect to the general elderly population due to the communal lifestyle within the facility and reported low frequency of exposure to sources of PM.},

However, this goal can only be achieved through a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms by which neurons die in these degenerative disorders. We review here the question of nitric oxide (NO), a small and ubiquitous molecule believed to be a pivotal element in the cascade of deleterious events underlying neurodegeneration in PD. Since NO synthases (NOS) are the only known enzymes that produce NO, in this chapter particular attention is paid to the anatomic distribution and catalytic activity of these enzymes in the brain. We also provide several experimental protocols commonly used for quantitative and qualitative studies of NOS.},

Measurements of PM and other criteria air pollutants were made inside selected individual residences within the retirement facility and at a central outdoor site on the premises. In addition, personal PM exposure monitoring was conducted for a subset of the participants, and ambient PM monitoring data were available for comparison from the NERL PM research monitoring platform in central Fresno. Both a winter (February 1-28, 1999) and a spring (April 19-May 16, 1999) study were completed so that seasonal effects could be evaluated. During the spring study, a more robust personal exposure component was added, as well as a more detailed evaluation of physical factors, such as air-exchange rate, that are known to influence the penetration of particles into the indoor environment. In this paper, comparisons are made among measured personal PM exposures and PM mass concentrations measured at the NERL Fresno Platform site, outside on the premises of the retirement facility, and inside selected residential apartments at the facility during the two 28-day study periods. The arithmetic daily mean personal PM2.5 exposure during the winter study period was 13.3 micrograms/m3, compared with 9.7, 20.5, and 21.7 micrograms/m3 for daily mean overall apartment, outdoor, and ambient (i.e., platform) concentrations, respectively.

In that review, based on videotapes or audiotapes of medical visits, consistent relationships between patient age and physicians' interviewing skills were found. Older patients received more information, more total communication and questions concerning drugs, more courtesy, and perhaps more formality reflected in less laughter and joking than younger patients. Ultimately, the subtle ageism that may be present in medical visits with older patients is probably balanced somewhat by communication advantages afforded them challenging the negative views of older patients' care prevalent in the literature. This balance may help explain the ubiquitous finding that older patients are more satisfied with their health care, despite poorer health status, than younger patients. Nevertheless, other patients, especially those in the oldest cohorts, are at high risk for passive relationships and communication complications related to low literacy and poor health status and deserve the attention and special consideration of providers and health service researchers.},

Much of this debate revolves around claims that particulate matter (usually represented by PM10) in the atmosphere directly influences mortality, hospital admissions with respiratory diseases, and so on. In this paper, we take a critical look at one of these issues, the influence of PM10 on deaths in the elderly population. Two data sets are considered, one from Birmingham (Alabama) and the other from Chicago. In both cases we find a significant PM10-mortality relationship in some of the models fitted, but not in others. Other issues considered include the existence of a threshold below which PM10 has no discernible influence, the interaction with other pollutants and the mortality displacement or harvesting effect (the theory that the direct effect of PM10 is limited to a very small subset of the population who are already critically ill and whose death is only advanced by a few hours or days as a result of air pollution). Overall, our conclusion is that there are too many uncertain issues to allow us to make definitive statements about a causal relationship between PM10 and mortality.},

The method was qualitative, specifically grounded theory. The earlier study took place when informants were senior nursing students. The follow-up study began after the informants had been practising for 1 year. Research questions guiding the study were: How do new graduate nurses describe their adaptation to the 'real world' of hospital nursing? What do they describe as factors influencing their moral values and ethical roles in hospital nursing? Preserving moral integrity was the basic psycho-social process that explained how these new graduate nurses adapted to the real world of hospital nursing. Six stages of this process were identified: vulnerability; getting through the day; coping with moral distress; alienation from self; coping with lost ideals; and integration of new professional self-concept. Moral distress was a consequence of the effort to preserve moral integrity. It is the result of believing that one is not living up to one's moral convictions. Data supported that the most pervasive attributes of moral distress were self-criticism and self-blame, as informants judged their actions against their moral convictions and their standards of what a good nurse would do. Moral distress was an acute form of psychological disorientation in which informants questioned their professional knowledge, what kind of nurses they were and what kind of nurses they were becoming. Theoretical explanations of these findings are grounded in social interaction and moral psychology theories.},

    abstract = {Previous studies of preferences for health insurance benefits have required individuals to make a series of complex and repetitive decisions, and have assumed that all insured benefits are desirable. This study reports the development and testing of a simple, innovative instrument to measure preferences for health insurance benefits. The newly developed instrument (Puzzle) is designed to allow subjects to select health benefits in a way that underscores the trade-offs dictated by budgets and costs. A "puzzle-like" frame representing budget constraints and "puzzle piece" benefit cards proportionately sized to represent the premium price of a single year's coverage comprise the instrument. In a comparison procedure (Money Game), participants "purchase" individual benefits by exchanging "play" money for benefit tokens. The Puzzle's utility was assessed by examining the convergence of results from both instruments and the subject's ratings of and preference for the instruments. One hundred five elderly Medicare enrollees seen in the general Internal Medicine outpatient clinic of a major southeastern teaching hospital were interviewed. Subjects answered interviewer-administered questionnaires and completed both the Puzzle and the Money Game. Both McNemar's test and Kendall's tau-b indicated a high degree of concordance between benefit choices made using the two instruments. Descriptive statistics demonstrated that the Puzzle was clear, easy to use, understandable, and preferred to the Money Game. The results suggest that the Puzzle is a promising tool for assessing health insurance coverage preferences under circumstances of limited expenditures, which can be modified for use with various populations who face limited insurance benefits.},

In this study we examined the relationship between the number of daily emergency room (ER) visits for respiratory illnesses (25 hospitals) and outdoor air pollution in Montreal, Quebec (June-August, 1989-1990). Air pollutants measured included 1- and 8-h maximum ozone (O3) and estimated particulate matter < 2.5 microns in aerometric diameter (PM2.5). Seasonal and day-of-week trends, autocorrelation, temperature, and relative humidity were controlled for in-time series regressions. Although O3 levels never exceeded the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 120 ppb (maximum day, 106 ppb), statistically significant (P < 0.01) relationships were found between respiratory ER visits for patients over the age of 64 and both 1- and 8-h maximum O3 measured 1 day prior to the ER visit day during the 1989 summer: ER visits were 18.7% higher than average (95% Cl, 6.5-30.9%) for a mean increase of 44 ppb O3 (1-h maximum), and 21.8% higher than average (95% Cl, 9.7-33.8%) for a mean increase of 38 ppb O3 (8-h maximum). There was an association between respiratory ER visits for the elderly and estimated PM2.5 lagged 1 day (0.1 visit/microgram/m3 PM2.5, P < 0.07), but this was confounded by both temperature and O3. The only finding for a reference group of nonrespiratory conditions was an inverse association between ER visits for infants and O3, but this was confounded by weather. These findings confirm the impression that while air quality standards may protect the respiratory health of the general population, this is not the case for susceptible subgroups such as the elderly.},

From the standpoints of both relative risk and attributable risk, the public health burden of ambient PM exposure is potentially greatest in elderly adults with underlying cardiopulmonary illness. Recent experimental data suggest that PM-borne transition metals have toxicity that could be mechanistically relevant to PM-related epidemiological findings. These data may prove to be especially relevant in elderly adults with cardiopulmonary illness. At the same time, important uncertainties remain in the epidemiological and experimental databases, such that the true degree of correspondence between the two is not yet known. In our opinion, this combination of emerging experimental-epidemiological coherence and remaining uncertainty imparts high priority to further research into the health effects of PM-borne transition metals. This research should not be confined to the respiratory system. Rather, it should examine the entire heart-lung axis and should probably consider other body systems (e.g. the vascular system) as well. In this research, close interdisciplinary communication should be sustained and experimental and epidemiological approaches should be coordinated to the maximum feasible extent.},

    abstract = {Although elderly inmates form a small minority in the U.S. prison population (6.6%), this number is expected to increase by 2005. Elderly prisoners consist of first-time offenders, habitual offenders, and those who have "aged in place" (received very long sentences at a young age). Violence is an identified stressor affecting the elderly prisoner. This enduring stressor can add to physical deterioration, particularly in the inmate with chronic illness. Violence in prison falls into three categories: prisoner-prisoner, staff-prisoner, or prisoner-staff (Clear & Cole, 1994). Prisoner-prisoner incidents account for the majority of violence within prison systems. The convict in today's prison will use extremes of violence to combat threats to his or her reputation or self-concept of "machismo," or if the inmate feels "disrespected." The aging prisoner may have chronic, pervasive stress levels disguised under a tough veneer, although he or she may no longer be strong enough physically or emotionally to fend off potential attackers. Interventions with elderly prisoners include thorough physical and cognitive assessment, including signs and symptoms of depression or stress related to environmental disturbances. Educational training for correctional staff about age-specific developmental changes is necessary. Building partnerships with community, state, and national organizations can assist elderly inmates in their adjustment to prison and foster successful community release programs. Special care units may be considered for frail elderly inmates or those with chronic health problems.},

The results reveal that practices of egg-restriction are pervasive throughout the four homes. Cholesterol has become a commonly-discussed issue in the daily lives of the 203 residents interviewed, and many of them were found to be preoccupied with the risk involved in excess consumption (especially of egg yolks) and increased serum cholesterol levels. Four forces: health professionals, family members, peer groups and mass media play important roles in constructing egg-consumption behaviors among the elderly subjects. The cognitive, psychological and behavioral impact of health information on elderly subjects has been discussed herein. It may be argued that the 'egg issue' reflects a shift in previous health paradigm thinking due to the biomedicalization of health promotion among Chinese elderly.},

    abstract = {Daily death counts in Mexico City were examined in relation to ambient ozone levels during 1990-1992 for the purpose of investigating the acute, irreversible effects of air pollution, with emphasis on ozone exposure. Air pollution data were obtained from nine monitoring stations operated by the Departamento del Distrito Federal. Mortality data were provided by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía, e Informática. Increases in numbers of deaths were positively associated with elevated air pollution levels on the same day and on the previous day. The magnitude of the increases was small but statistically significant, after Poisson regression models were used to adjust for temperature and long-term trends. In models using data for a single pollutant, the "crude" ratio for total mortality associated with an increase of 100 parts per billion (ppb)* in one-hour maximum ozone concentration was 1.029 (95% CI 1.015, 1.044). A moving average of ozone showed a stronger association (rate ratio [RR] = 1.048, 95% CI 1.025, 1.070), and excess mortality (an increase in the number of deaths, relative to the average on days with low pollution levels) was more evident for persons over 65 years of age. Separate analyses of the effect of elevated ozone for different areas of the city showed similar results, but they were not statistically significant. Other pollutants also were related to mortality. The RR was 1.075 (95% CI 0.984, 1.062) per 100-ppb increase for sulfur dioxide and 1.049 (95% CI 1.030, 1.067) per 100 micrograms/m3 increase in total suspended particulates (TSP) when these pollutants were considered in separate models. However, when all three pollutants were considered simultaneously, only TSP remained associated with mortality, indicating excess mortality of 5% per 100 micrograms/m3 increase [RR = 1.052, 95% CI 1.034, 1.072]. The excess mortality associated with TSP is consistent with that observed in other cities in America and Europe. This study provides some evidence that ozone is associated with all-cause mortality and with mortality among the elderly after controlling for long-term cycles. However, ozone levels exhibited little or no effect on mortality rates when other air pollutants were considered simultaneously. Particulate matter appeared to be an important pollutant; it independently predicted changes in mortality. Nevertheless, because of the complexity and variability of the mixtures to which people are exposed, it is difficult to attribute the observed effects to a single pollutant. The technical feasibility and scientific validity of isolating the effect of single pollutants in such complex mixtures requires further research and careful consideration. Given the large population living in and exposed to ambient air pollution in Mexico City and other metropolises throughout the world, these small but significant associations of mortality with air pollution indices are of public health concern.},

It is essential that nurses use experiential and scientific knowledge to promote a better understanding of the aging process as part of normal development. These two types of knowledge will enable them to understand the process in its entirety and to grasp the true meaning of being old. Chronological age is not the only clue to biological aging. There is no unique model. Aging is a combination of various profiles of complex relationships between biological, psychological and social variables. A better knowledge of the normal aging process will encourage nurses to have a realistic and positive view, to facilitate elders' adjustment, and help them to maintain a better quality of life.},

    abstract = {Dementia, delirium and depression are the 3 most prevalent mental disorders in the elderly. While dementia and depression are prevalent in the community, hospitals and nursing homes, delirium is seen most often in acute care hospitals. Much of the management of these syndromes is undertaken by primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists. Therefore, it is imperative that generalist physicians be adept at recognising, evaluating and managing patients with these syndromes. Because no diagnostic tests are pathognomonic of these syndromes, the differential diagnosis hinges on a careful clinical evaluation. The first step is to recognise which of the syndromes is present. Dementia is defined by a chronic loss of intellectual or cognitive function of sufficient severity to interfere with social or occupational function. Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness marked by an attention deficit and a change in cognitive function. Depression is an affective disorder evidenced by a dysphoric mood, but the most pervasive symptom is a loss of ability to enjoy usual activities. It is important to recognise that these syndromes are not mutually exclusive, as dementia frequently coexists with delirium and depression. Furthermore, physical diagnoses, such as chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and endocrine disorders, are frequently associated with depressive symptoms. Given this, a comprehensive evaluation is mandatory. Laboratory tests are necessary to exclude concurrent metabolic, endocrine and infectious disorders, and drug effects. Imaging studies should be obtained selectively in patients with signs and symptoms, such as focal neurological findings and gait disturbances, which are suggestive of structural lesions: stroke, subdural haematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus and brain tumours. Appropriate management involving pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures will result in significant improvement in most patients with these syndromes. Potentially offending drugs should be discontinued. In delirious patients the underlying illness must be treated concomitantly with the use of psychotropics, if necessary. Although no current medications have been shown to have a significant effect on the functional status of patients with the 2 most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, the management of concomitant illness in these patients may result in improved function for as long as a year. Tacrine, an anticholinesterase inhibitor, improves cognitive function slightly in selected patients with Alzheimer's disease over short periods. Finally, the treatment of depression with medications or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in significant reductions in mortality and morbidity.},

The various hazards were applied to the same time and space frame, that of a 24-hour period and in the urban space used by elderly homeless people. Incorporated into the approach are the concepts of high-risk areas and space-time geography, and the theory of disease ecology. The spatial-temporal distribution of resources, factors in the natural environment (patterns of daylight and dark and ambient temperature) and factors in the human-created environment (traffic and crime patterns) were identified as important hazards within the urban environment. Homelessness itself, the effects of aging, the social milieu, and behavior patterns commonly seen in homeless people--particularly, alcohol abuse--were identified as important hazards for elderly homeless people. Each hazard's spatial-temporal pattern within the 24-hour period is discussed. Then the convergence of hazards forming an interactive effect is discussed.

Daily levels of sulfates were recorded at nine monitoring stations representing three different networks operated by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Environment Canada. Positive and statistically significant associations were found between hospital admissions and both ozone and sulfates recorded on the day of admission and up to 3 days prior to the date of admission. Five percent of daily respiratory admissions in the months of May to August were associated with ozone, with sulfates accounting for an additional 1% of these admissions. Ozone was a stronger predictor of admissions than sulfates. Positive and statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations were observed between the ozone-sulfate pollution mix and admissions for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and infections. Positive associations were also found in all age groups, with the largest impact on infants (15% of admissions associated with the ozone-sulfate pollution mix) and the least effects on the elderly (4%). Temperature had no effect on the air pollution-admission relationship. Ozone (lagged 1 day) and sulfates (lagged 1 day) displayed a positive association with respiratory admissions for 91 and 100% of the 168 acute care hospitals, respectively. Air pollution was not related to a class of nonrespiratory admissions, which served as a negative control, nor was it related to admissions in the winter months of December to March, when ozone and sulfate levels are low and when people spend a considerable amount of time indoors.},

Estimated incidence rates of 30.8 per 1000 per year for 'probable pervasive depression' and 15.4 per 1000 per year for GMS diagnostic depression were calculated using results from a short-CARE screen in 1988. Among GMS diagnostic depression cases, anxiety was the major psychiatric comorbid feature (95%) and organic features were uncommon (8.4%). Of 66 self-CARE cases, 48 (73%) were also GMS-AGECAT cases; of 24 self-CARE non-cases, 15 (62.5%) were not GMS-AGECAT cases. Among subjects who had 'probable pervasive depression', 38% said that they had declared their symptoms to their general practitioner. Only 14% of subjects were prescribed antidepressants; 24% were prescribed hypnotics. Half the GMS-AGECAT-case subjects who stated that they had declared to their general practitioner were on specific therapy. Screening for depression and health education aimed at increasing psychological declaration are seen as ways forward in the management of this depression.},

Other work has suggested that a number of significant age-related changes, across a variety of cognitive abilities, are based on social experiences, such as occupational or recreational activities. The current study is based on earlier research by Perlmutter and her colleagues (1990) and examines age and skill-related differences among adults engaged in a social-recreational activity. BINGO players, ranging in age from nineteen to seventy-four, and having from less than two months to over twenty years of playing experience, were given a variety of psychometric, cognitive, and experimental measures. The participants were also observed as they played real BINGO games. No age-related differences were found on the psychometric or memory measures, suggesting that BINGO playing experience may have positive benefits for many older adults. Skilled players at all age levels were found to be more efficient in their game-playing actions. The oldest and most experienced players did not differ from the younger, equally experienced, players on the cognitive and skill-based tasks. These findings demonstrate the need to investigate adaptive competence in those situations in which social-environmental factors play a role in enhancing older adults' cognitive skills.},

These findings provided the basis for an invitational workshop, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to formulate a research agenda for geriatric care in HMOs. The case study method involved site visits to seven HMOs by a physician with expertise in geriatrics, a managed care specialist, and a program development specialist. Representatives from the HMOs included senior executive officials, physicians recognized for providing and promoting geriatric care, research and program development staff, and various clinical staff including pharmacists, geriatric nurse practitioners, nurses, and social workers. The most frequently encountered geriatric care programs were categorized by the following six objectives: (1) identifying high risk patients, (2) assessing multi-problem patients, (3) treating multi-problem patients, (4) rehabilitating patients following acute events, (5) reducing medication problems, and (6) providing long-term care and home health care. Unique programs identified from these site visits included screening methods for new enrollees, approaches to comprehensive geriatric assessment, use of skilled nursing facilities for intensive rehabilitation and postacute care, and drug profiling and review. Utilization of geriatric nurse specialists and programs aimed at coordination with social services were pervasive in many of these HMOs. Workshop participants proposed several research and demonstration projects in all six areas. Overall consensus emerged that HMOs with Medicare-risk contracts provide a valuable setting for experimentation in geriatric care. Given the current health policy emphasis on managed care and capitated payment methodologies, geriatric care research in HMOs should be a high priority.},

I then determined whether physicians who are more prone to admit patients use hospitals for more discretionary purposes and admit patients who are less ill. Although the differences between physicians with different practice styles were in the expected direction, the most compelling finding was the similarity in characteristics of patients admitted by physicians with markedly different practice styles. Such findings suggest a very wide latitude in physicians' decisions to admit patients; this latitude is not well captured by a model that posits a logical relationship between physician treatment patterns and patient need.},

These attitudes are later reflected in the views of health professionals. An essential component of effective care for the elderly is the attitude of the caregivers. Staff attitudes are considered important because of their presumed influence on staff behavior and the quality of care delivered. Attitude change is very difficult to achieve unless the individual is exposed to an experience that places the learning situation on a very personal level. Experiential learning activities can be tailored to provide that personal experience. If attitudes can be changed at the same time that factual information is being presented, experiential activities offer the educator a potent tool for learning. This paper suggests several such activities aimed at enhancing positive attitudes toward the elderly.},

While the overall U.S. population has tripled since 1900, the segment over 65 has increased eightfold. Because of the high incidence of chronic illness in persons over 65, they consume a disproportionate amount of health care. Contributing to the problem are pervasive attitudes of ageism in the U.S. culture (including those of physicians), with the result that old people in the U.S. receive fragmented and often substandard medical care, particularly in nursing homes. Although some stirrings of activity in geriatric medicine are apparent in medical schools, not nearly enough faculty are available to teach courses and the interest of medical students is low. Several trends indicate that physician assistants are prepared to help fill the gaps in health care of the elderly. First, as physician extenders, these allied health professionals have demonstrated that they can perform approximately 80% of primary care tasks carried out by physicians at no sacrifice of quality. Second, a large proportion of the current caseload of physician assistants is patients over the age of 65. Third, physician assistant training programs have incorporated a fivefold increase in geriatric courses into their curricula since 1980, and both students and graduates show a high interest in this field. Finally, reimbursement policies of third party payers indicate a trend toward underwriting more physician assistant services. For example, Medicare Part B recently included payment of physician assistants in nursing homes and hospitals.},

It is the author's contention that the elderly person, upon retirement, presents an adaptive energy reserve highly personalized in its ability to accommodate to change, and especially dependent upon the nature, number and intensity of environmental stressors to adapt, successfully or unsuccessfully, to senescence. Various environmental stressors are identified (e.g., changes in social opportunities and expectations which create new needs and constrict the realm of emotional and vocational influence, thus reducing opportunities and diminishing self-esteem). Heavy emphasis is placed upon role theory, interaction ritual, and transactional analysis. These concepts are extended to the institutional setting - an environment which serves only to magnify mechanisms occurring throghout the social system while adding its own unique dimension to the stressors confronting the elderly.},

    abstract = {A study was made of the significance of cold nosetips as a simple prognostic sign in the elderly sick. This sign was thought to be due to the presence of chronic brain damage. Nosetip temperatures were compared with forehead and ambient temperatures in 400 patients until recovery, death or transfer. Weekly readings were taken, and may have failed to give an accurate record in those observed for 4 weeks or less, though here 56% of the 154 fatalities had low nosetip temperatures. A longer-stay group consisted of 177 cases, of whom 155 had low nosetip temperatures at some time. 87 patients in this group died, 43 remained disabled and only 25 regained their previous state of health. It is concluded that low nosetip temperatures provide a useful indicator that adequate recovery is unlikely to occur.},
