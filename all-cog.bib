 abstract = {Technology advances and the continuing convergence of computing and telecommunications have made an unprecedented amount of information available to the public. For many people with disabilities, however, accessibility issues limit the impact of such widespread availability. Of the many types of disabilities-mobility, hearing, and learning impairments, for example-vision impairments are most pervasive in the general population, especially among seniors. The world's rapidly aging population is redefining visually impaired, which refers to individuals with low vision (that is, people for whom ordinary eyeglasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lens implants don't provide clear vision), color blindness, and blindness. In 1998, the US Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act, strengthening provisions covering access to government-posted information for people with disabilities. As amended, Section 508 requires federal agencies to ensure that all assets and technologies are accessible and usable by employees and the public, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. Most current assistive technologies for visually impaired users are expensive, difficult to use, and platform dependent. A new approach by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), addresses these weaknesses by locating the assistive capability at the server, thus freeing visually impaired individuals from the software expense, technical complexity, and substantial learning curve of other assistive technologies. NLM's Senior Health Web site (http://nihseniorhealth.gov), a talking Web (a Web application that presents Web content as speech to users), demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.},

 abstract = {The U.S. has experienced a rapid growth in the use of computers by elders. E-mail, Web browsing, and computer games are among the most common routine activities for this group of users. In this paper, we describe techniques for unobtrusively monitoring naturally occurring computer interactions to detect sustained changes in cognitive performance. Researchers have demonstrated the importance of the early detection of cognitive decline. Users over the age of 75 are at risk for medically related cognitive problems and confusion, and early detection allows for more effective clinical intervention. In this paper, we present algorithms for inferring a user's cognitive performance using monitoring data from computer games and psychomotor measurements associated with keyboard entry and mouse movement. The inferences are then used to classify significant performance changes, and additionally, to adapt computer interfaces with tailored hints and assistance when needed. These methods were tested in a group of elders in a residential facility.},

Relying on self-report by the patient or their family is equally unreliable. We propose an alternative paradigm in which continuous, unobtrusive monitoring is used to observe changes in physical behavior over time. We highlight the use of this technique for monitoring motor activity that may be predictive of early cognitive changes in the elderly. Initial results using a system of low-cost wireless sensors are presented, together with a discussion of appropriate analyses and interpretation of such data. Using low-cost wireless sensor network coupled with algorithms to detect changes in relevant patterns of behavior, we are able to detect both acute and gradual changes that may indicate a need for medical intervention.},

With the advent of new drugs and therapies to delay the onset of dementia, it is important to both detect signs as early as possible and to provide monitoring of cognitive changes. This paper describes unobtrusive methods for monitoring user interactions with a computer that serve as a basis for algorithms to measure cognitive performance. We adapted a standard computer game currently enjoyed by elders at risk for dementia in order to monitor natural performance on a task that involved significant strategic planning throughout the game. This enabled us to collect cognitive performance data on individuals at frequent intervals. We monitored move-by-move appropriateness as distance to solution, and additionally modeled user thought processes using between-move data from the mouse device. We then used our resulting dynamic user model both to adapt the game difficulty and to detect meaningful individual cognitive trends.},

These methods do not lend themselves to frequent monitoring and trend detection. In this paper, we describe a method for using enjoyable computer games with embedded cognitive metrics to monitor within-subject trends in performance. We have created a set of 9 computer games to specifically measure various cognitive domains that are normally administered in routine neuropsychological assessments, such as verbal fluency, working memory, attention, and planning. Although the measurements are not taken in a controlled setting, there are distinct advantages to being able to collect data frequently in a naturalistic setting. Routine measurements over time allow us to detect trends in various aspects of cognitive performance and avoid biases due to education, culture, and experience.},

The user interface is a key issue when working with the elderly and those with disabilities. To ensure proper usability and avoid abandoning of the device, an alarm-detection procedure has been developed and contrasted with end-users. The application scenario is the isolated village of Fortanete, Spain, where the self- sustainability of the system is essential. In this environment, management of the alarm relies upon the user's relatives and neighbours to solve any problems that arise. Privacy and ethical considerations have also been addressed, as this kind of system can potentially invade the users' privacy; cognitive disabilities of the users also make it mandatory.},

 abstract = {The ever growing percentage of elderly people within modern societies poses welfare systems under relevant stress. In fact, partial and progressive loss of motor, sensorial, and/or cognitive skills renders elders unable to live autonomously, eventually leading to their hospitalization. This results in both relevant emotional and economic costs. Ubiquitous computing technologies can offer interesting opportunities for in-house safety and autonomy. However, existing systems partially address in-house safety requirements and typically focus on only elder monitoring and emergency detection. The paper presents ANGELAH, a middleware-level solution integrating both "elder monitoring and emergency detection" solutions and networking solutions. ANGELAH has two main features: i) it enables efficient integration between a variety of sensors and actuators deployed at home for emergency detection and ii) provides a solid framework for creating and managing rescue teams composed of individuals willing to promptly assist elders in case of emergency situations. A prototype of ANGELAH, designed for a case study for helping elders with vision impairments, is developed and interesting results are obtained from both computer simulations and a real-network testbed.},

 abstract = {Dementia is a progressive and often gradual decline in mental ability that affects thinking, remembering and reasoning. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, there are many other causes of cognitive decline, such as age related memory loss. Technological and medical advancements have pushed life expectancy higher, thus increasing the number of elderly people and consequently the number of patients that need to be hospitalized. This puts financial pressure on medical institutions which, in conjunction with the shortage of geriatric care professionals, has prompted these institutions to seek various cost-cutting strategies. In particular, technological solutions can address these problems through monitoring and assisting patients with cognitive decline and providing support to their caregivers. The aim is to provide a smart environment that lessens the demand for caregivers to manually assess patients' behavior in specific tasks and hence evaluate cognitive decline. Additionally, within these environments it becomes feasible to implement assistive applications that can support dementia patients while performing everyday tasks. In this respect, this paper proposes the fusion of machine vision and an RFID system that can effectively address the above issues. We will also describe two scenarios that correspond to two different activities the patient can perform and provide an insight into the solutions that are used to support patients and their caregivers in these scenarios.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design of an intelligent walking aid for the frail and elderly as well as for patients who are recovering from surgical procedures, in order to enhance safer mobility for these study populations. The device augments a conventional rolling walker aid with sensing and navigational abilities to safely travel through an environment following user's perceived intentions, unless collisions or instability is imminent. The agent, embodied as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), critically relies on minimal user input to seamlessly recognise user's short-term intended behaviour, constantly updating this projection to allow for inconspicuous user-robot integration. This, in turn, shifts user's focus from fine motor-skilled control to coarse indications broadly intended to convey intention. Overall, the system can afford an increase in safety for the cognitive user through preventative care - reduced number of falls or collision with surrounding objects, minimising health-care expenses as well as increasing independent living for people with gait disorders. Successful simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed architecture for a practical robotic rollator design.},

 abstract = {In less than 25 years, 37 million people are expected to have dementia and/or Alzheimerpsilas disease. This significant figure is a result of several factors, including increasing life expectancy and an ageing population in developing countries. Alzheimerpsilas disease, a form of dementia, is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory loss, and behavior and personality changes. People suffering from this disease become increasingly physically and cognitively impaired; they usually need help with all aspects of daily living. While there is currently no cure for dementia, special therapies (e.g., arts and crafts, music therapy) can help people with dementia to live as good a life as possible. We propose to use socially assistive robots as customized/individualized helpers as a complement to humans. This work proposes a new adaptive socially assistive robotic (SAR) system that aims to provide a customized protocol through motivation, encouragement, and companionship for users suffering from cognitive changes related to aging and/or Alzheimerpsilas disease. The robot aims to maintain/improve the userpsilas cognitive attention in a cognitive music game setup.},

In this paper, we describe a system for continuous and unobtrusive in-home assessment of gait velocity, a critical metric of function. This system is based on estimating walking speed from noisy time and location data collected by a ??sensor line?? of restricted view passive infrared motion detectors. We demonstrate the validity of our system by comparing with measurements from the commercially available GAITRite walkway system gait mat. We present the data from 882 walks from 27 subjects walking at three different subject-paced speeds (encouraged to walk slowly, normal speed, or fast) in two directions through a sensor line. The experimental results show that the uncalibrated system accuracy (average error) of estimated velocity was 7.1 cm/s (SD = 11.3 cm/s), which improved to 1.1 cm/s (SD = 9.1 cm/s) after a simple calibration procedure. Based on the average measured walking speed of 102 cm/s, our system had an average error of less than 7% without calibration and 1.1% with calibration.},

 abstract = {While pervasive healthcare systems bear the potential to provide patients with a new quality of medical homecare, the complexity of such systems raises fundamental questions of behavior, communication and technology acceptance. This is especially important, as users of future healthcare systems will be increasingly characterized by diversity. Relying only on highly experienced and technology-prone user groups, which might have been typical users in the last decades, is not sufficient anymore. Rather, elderly users, users with a completely different upbringing and domain knowledge, and ill or handicapped people will have to use the systems. Today, the understanding, in which way physical, emotional and cognitive abilities, caused by individual learning histories and health states, may impact the usage and acceptance of pervasive healthcare technologies, is restricted. This research contributes to this topic by investigating the acceptance motives of aged users with different health states regarding three different implementation concepts for medical technologies: medical technology implemented in mobile devices, smart environments and smart clothing. Using the questionnaire method, a total of 82 users between 40 and 92 years of age were examined regarding their usage motives and barriers with respect to the different technology concepts. Overall, it was revealed that acceptance issues and users' needs and wants should be considered in order to successfully design new medical technologies.},

The aim is to increase the caregiver's awareness about the situations of care of older people in a nursing home, so that caregivers could act appropriately and timely to attend those situations. Firstly, we present the results of a study to understand the situations of care that occur at a nursing home. Later, we propose the design of a context-aware notification environment whose design was informed by this understanding. One of the main features of this environment is that it takes into consideration the contextual information both from the caregiver and from the elder in order to adapt the notification. Preliminary results of the evaluation of an implementation with an audio notification mechanism are promising. During the evaluation period caregivers perceived an increase in their awareness of the situations of care and a safer working environment regarding the provided quality of care.},

Currently, a growing body of research supports the effectiveness of using non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the decline of or improve brain functioning in people suffering from dementia. However, implementing and sustaining such interventions on a long-term basis is difficult as they require considerable resources and people, and can be very time-consuming for healthcare staff. Our research focuses on making these interventions more accessible to healthcare professionals through the aid of robotic assistants while validating their effectiveness. The objective of our work is to develop intelligent socially assistive robots as therapeutic aids designed to maintain, and even improve, the residual social and cognitive functioning in persons with dementia. In this paper, we study the social interaction attributes of our human-like socially assistive robot, Brian 2.0, during a person-centered cognitively stimulating activity to determine if the robot is able to engage a person in the activity by providing task assistance, encouragement, reinforcement, and celebration. Our preliminary proof-of-concept results show that the social interaction capabilities of Brian 2.0 are effective in engaging individuals in a cognitively stimulating game.},

Spatial orientation decline constitutes however an high limitation for elderly population and it has a great impact on subject the day-life autonomy and on her/his relatives and caregivers. Despite this, the neuropsychological approach on spatial cognition does not allow researchers and clinicians to have an accurate assessment of patient's everyday wayfinding ability. This could be critical in a borderline situation, such as in an age-related cognitive decline, in which spatial stimuli can be correctly individuated even if wayfinding is compromised. The main aim of this contribution is to introduce preliminary data about a spatial evaluation procedure - the VR Maze test - on healthy elderly and Alzheimer's population.

Based on this information, adequate help can be provided. We developed an approach to processing information regarding the modeling of daily routines and a comparison to previous days. Our solution can be seen as a combination of three approaches: a cosinor analysis based on the theory of circadian rhythms as a special representative of regression analysis, a histogram-based approach based on movement data, and a probabilistic model of behavior (PMB) based on the person's activities of daily living (ADL).},

The work described here, highlights the significance of developing human-computer interaction systems focusing on the needs of end-users. Specific design techniques are adopted in order to provide seniors with content that is easily accessible and comprehensible. Some early results of a first prototype are presented. 14 seniors in total, either healthy or with cognitive decline (either mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) have provided feedback on several aspects of platform usability. An additional evaluation component of the platform that is thoroughly investigated is the affective evaluation of the FFA platform. An important conclusion that stems from the present research is the highly significant predictive value of affective states on usability evaluation, highlighting the important role of the entertaining exergaming environment regarding its usability. Further investigation on the enhancement of seniors' affective experience during game play is of utmost importance to us, as there is strong evidence that dynamic game content adaptation according to one's affective state would result into better training adherence and seniors' reinforcement of motivation.},

Methods: The impact in balance was measured using Berg scale, the activities of daily living using Barthel, cognitive status using MMSe and perceived health status using SF-36. A sample of 65 seniors from a nursing home was randomly allocated to 3 groups: Wii with the supervision of a Physiotherapist (Group A; n=23), Wii without supervision (Group B; n=20), and just Geriatric Gymnastics (Group C; n=22) during 20 sessions. Results: Better attendance and satisfaction were obtained in Group A. In physical terms significant better results were found in SF 36 on Group A and in Berg score of Group C. In mental assessment, a significant worse result was obtained in SF36 of Group A. Also significantly better results in Vitality and Mental Health of Group B were obtained. In therapy exposure, there were significantly better results in group A of the SF36 in individuals with more than 750 minutes (15 sessions). There were no accidents and/or injury registered during the sessions. Conclusion: The supervised use of the Wii, improves the physical component of the elderly and it also can be a motivating factor for exercise practice. This activity can bring better perception of the vitality of the elderly and physical functioning. In other aspects it may also have a depressive effect on some participants. This study highlights the importance of expert supervision when using a Wii as a therapeutic instrument in a senior population.},

 abstract = {The growing number of elderly population at home and abroad necessitates improved approaches to elderly care provision. Elders, often with cognitive and physical impairment, need assistance in their activities of daily living (ADLs), which is usually provided by human caregivers (HCGs). As the demand for caregiver's assistance increases, the shortage of traditional care resources becomes obvious. In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a HCG to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons' activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt HCG depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the HCG but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregiver's acceptance, and their engagement.},

Prior research has shown an accelerated need for the expansion in the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) domain and to that end we present a novel learning technique for intelligent agents that are embedded in Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs). A novel agent that combines an emotion recognition system with a fuzzy logic based learning and adaptation technique provides for an automated self-learning system that constantly adapts to individual requirements. This agent, entitled Health Adaptive Emotion Fuzzy Agent (HAOEFA), has the ability to model and learn the user behaviour in order to control the environment on their behalf with respect to his/her emotional preferences. In addition, the agent incorporates temporal adaption in order to facilitate changing behaviour and preferences within the environment. The results show that such architecture can both provide monitoring and ambient environmental control features such that users with limited physical or cognitive functions can have their well-being advanced with limited external resources.},

KiMentia uses skeletal tracking to capture the body movements, enabling users to control and interact with the computer without any intermediary controller. Furthermore, all the data generated during the session is stored in order to log every rehabilitation activity. Preliminary tests have shown an increase in the users' motivation while using the tool forgetting that it focuses on the cognitive stimulation.

 abstract = {Walking is a popular recreation activity. In addition, it is a mild and healthy exercise for the elderly. However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. The development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a main topic of this paper. We discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. In the previous report, we developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. In this paper, we propose a new structure to control a frictional resistance force that is generated on the surface of the MSE and a metal pin. In addition, we propose to use this device as a single unit for the haptic device on feet. According to the compressive test of the unit, the maximum force that can be controlled with the unit is insufficient yet. However, it appears that we can control frictional force with the proposed structure. We also conducted a simulation to estimate required values of the performance for the unit. It is much higher than the current state of the unit. We have to improve the performance of the unit in the future.},

 abstract = {With more and more elders in most countries, the health and safety issues become the primary concern for elderly people because ageing is often associated with physical and cognitive impairments. In order to provide intelligent assistive services for elders, in this paper, we propose an integrated service platform that can accommodate safety assurance, daily activity assistance, and health support services. Specifically, the platform takes care of anomalous events detection, daily activities tracking, and health status monitoring leveraging stationary sensors deployed in living environments and mobile sensing artifacts carried by elders. The services in this integrated platform can ensure safety and independency of elders, they can also help them sustain and/or improve health condition with personalized health support. Based on the proposed platform, we present a case study of assistive safety assurance service wandering detection, which monitors an elder's outdoor movements by using GPS sensor embedded in smart phone and recognizes the lapping or pacing movement pattern to find potential wandering behavior. The experimental results show that our method works well in detecting wandering behavior in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate.},

 abstract = {Walking and traveling are popular recreation activities for the elderly in Japan. These activities are also mild exercises and have good effects for their health. However, people suffering from physical and / or cognitive disorders have a difficulty in going out and walking in real environments. Therefore we have proposed a virtual walking system with a haptic device on feet. This system consists of visual, sound, and haptic devices to present various kinds of ambient information for users. Especially, development of the haptic interface for feet soles is a new challenge. In this paper, we discuss a use of magnetic field sensitive elastomers (MSEs) as working materials for the device. We developed an electromagnet as a testbed of MSE and evaluated it performance. According to the measurement of planter pressures, this device can perform different pressures on soles by applying magnetic field. The result also implied necessities of the improvement of the magnetic circuit and basic structure for more feasible device. According to the experimental results on a dot-type braille block, a target level of the maximum plantar pressure was clarified. On the basis of these results, we designed a unit for the haptic device on feet.},

 abstract = {In advanced countries throughout the world, the population of Alzheimer's Disease(AD) patients has been gradually increasing with the aging of the society. As a result, it has become an important research topic how to diagnose AD early and give necessary treatment and training to AD patients, especially those with mild cognitive impairment(MCI), whose executive functions such as response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, attention switching and planning may display evident disorder and impairment. Unlike traditional paper tests and subjective assessments by the patient's relatives, this study adopts virtual reality(VR) technology to develop a novel diagnosis & assessment system, which uses head mounted display(HMD), game technology and sensors to generate an interactive and panoramic scenario-a virtual convenience store-for assessment of executive functions and memory. A variety of tasks of multi-layered difficulty-level hierarchy, such as memorizing a shopping list, looking for certain goods, and checking out, has been designed for customized and adaptive assessment, training, and treatment of MD. In the meantime, the study also records test-takers' performance data (including path and central-vision movement) in the process of all tasks for the development of a novel diagnosis & assessment method. Moreover, test-takers' technology acceptance is measured for assessing the elderly's subjective perception of new technology and discussing the topic of human-machine interaction. In the study, tests on 2 healthy adults have been completed, the system's functionality has been preliminarily verified, and test-takers' subjective perception of the system has been investigated.},

The system is a technological solution based on external aid at a practical level (substitution-based rehabilitation). In particular, we propose a model focused on points of interest or well-known places, in which user-friendly routes to a destination are generated based on the user context rather than the conventional street names and quantitative distances. Moreover, the system offers augmented reality views that include contextual information. This philosophy of navigation more closely matches the needs of the user than do conventional navigation systems; the proposal is especially useful for users who are not accustomed to using new technologies (e.g., elderly people), people experiencing disorientation and, more generally, individuals with a slight cognitive deficit. The system also includes an application that allows the relatives of the user to establish tasks that must be performed at a specific location and to monitor the activities of the user to detect potentially risky situations.},

On the other hand, the advance in health care prolongs the elderly life that in turn causes side effect of increasing healthcare cost to government and elderly family. Unfortunately, most seniors are prone to deteriorating health, which may result in mental or physical impairment. Therefore, research in senile diseases will definitely become active. This study puts emphasis on the prophylaxis of elderly health care, especially the cognition related issues. Several systems, including visual, audio, and memory tests, are designed on Tablet PC for elderly to self evaluate their health status. The advantages of the proposed systems lie in providing the elderly handy tools to perform the evaluation without going back and forth to the hospital, receive the test results immediately, and retrieve the records anytime at home. The results from the proposed systems are compared with other methods to verify their effectiveness and practicality in early evaluation of senile dementia.},

We developed a new game concept, Dual-Task Tai Chi (DTTC), using Kinect (Microsoft Co.), a motion-capture device, and demonstrated that the DTTC test can quantitatively evaluate various functions that are known risk factors for falling in elderly adults. Moreover, DT training has been attracting attention as a way to improve balance and DT ability. However, only a few studies have reported that it improves cognitive performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether or not a 12-week program of DTTC training would effectively improve cognitive functions. A total of 41 elderly individuals (training group: n = 26, control group: n = 15) participated in this study and their cognitive functions were assessed before and after DTTC training. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with significant group x time interactions for the executive cognitive function measure: t:. trail-making test (part Bpart A) (p <; 0.05). The results suggest that DTTC training is effective for improving executive cognitive functions.},

However, very less focus has been directed to address the entertainment needs of the elderly, which is an important aspect for an enjoyable living. This paper proposes the design of a context-aware elderly entertainment support system (CAEESS) by investigating the entertainment requirements based on the perspectives of elderly and caregiver. Our focus is on the technical platform to fulfill the identified requirements. The proposed system facilitates the elderly to access various entertainment services through different modes of interaction and also empowers the caregiver to select entertainment media or resources for the elderly when needed. We believe that the proposed approach will provide a clear understanding of the requirements of CAEESS and enable us to effectively address the problems related to the independent and happy living of the elderly.},

Within the European FP7 project “CompanionAble” (2008-2012) [1], we developed assistive technologies combining a mobile robot and smart environment with the aim to support these people and assist them living in their familiar home environment. For a final evaluation, user experience studies were conducted with volunteer users who were invited to a test home where they lived and freely used the robot and integrated system over a period of two days. Services provided by the companion robot include reminders of appointments (pre-defined or added by the users themselves or their informal carer) as well as frequent recommendations to specific activities, which were listed e.g. by their family carers. Furthermore, video contact with relatives and friends, a cognitive stimulation game designed especially to counter the progress of cognitive impairments, and the possibility to store personal items with the robot are offered. Recognition of the user entering or leaving the home is triggering situation specific reminders like agenda items due during the (expected) absence, missed calls or items not to be forgotten. Continuing our previous work published in [2], this paper presents detailed description of the implemented assistive functions and results of user studies conducted during April and May 2012 in the smart house of the Dutch project partner Smart Homes in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.},

In particular, the Multiple Errands Test is an assessment of executive functions in daily life which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where there are items to be bought and information to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 10), and healthy older participants (n = 10). The general purpose of the study was investigated through the following specific objectives: (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions; and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test and in the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions. Correlations between Virtual Multiple Errands Test variables and some traditional executive functions measures provide preliminary support for the ecological and construct validity of the VMET; further performance obtained at the Virtual Multiple Errands Test provided a distinction between the clinical and healthy population, and between the two age control groups. These results suggest a possible future application of such an ecological approach for cognitive assessment and rehabilitation of stroke patients and elderly population with age-related cognitive decline.},

Consequently, the spatial disorientation has become a significant problem for older people and their caregivers. The ambient-assisted living applications are offering location-based services for empowering elderly to go outside and encouraging a greater independence. Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness service enabler aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the service enabler introduced contribute to “context-awareness” paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences.},

Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

 abstract = {As older adults age, they are more likely to reside in long-term care facilities due to the decline in cognitive and/or physical abilities that prevent them from living independently. With a rapidly aging population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services, assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan, schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate the specific design considerations and the impressions of long-term care residents, healthcare professionals, and family members on a socially assistive robot designed to autonomously facilitate cognitively and socially stimulating leisure activities. Thematic analysis of focus group sessions conducted at a long-term care facility with the aforementioned individuals revealed important design considerations for the development and integration of a socially assistive robot in long-term care facilities.},

 abstract = {Many platforms have emerged as response to the call for technology supporting active and healthy aging. Key requirements for any such e-health systems and any subsequent business exploitation are tailor-made design and proper evaluation. This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability, user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than 100 participants. The use of formal tools makes the findings comparable to other studies and forms an elderly exergaming corpus.},

To meet needs of seniors and meet economic and sociological challenges such as the pressure on health support services for semi-autonomous persons, smart home technology is considered by many researchers as a promising potential solution. This approach proposes to use ubiquitous sensors hidden in the environment for monitoring and detecting behavioral abnormalities associated with cognitive deficits and then do a proper guidance by giving hints using many kinds of effectors (light, sound, screen, etc.). In a smart environment, assistive system is an important technology in order to fulfill the need to provide support in living environment for people with cognitive deficit.

 abstract = {Robot social support systems such as robot partner's game interactions with elderly people are very important in ageing societies. Human-robot interaction can decrease the risk of ageing disease such as dementia and thus improve the overall quality of life for the elderly people. However, in order for the robot partner to have successful game interactions with the elderly people, the robot partners need to be equipped with a certain degree of cognitive intelligence to guess the meaning and context of game interactions. In this paper, we discuss a biological stress-inspired model for the robot's cognitive intelligence with dynamic optimisation on its working memory. We name this novel robot's cognitive framework as Advanced Intelligence Cognitive Optimisation (AICO). AICO is a server framework for computational intensive cognitive processing for the smart phone robot known as iPhonoid. We have conducted physical robot experiments with our proposed iPhonoid AICO framework on Rényi-Ulam guessing game with real human subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed AICO framework successfully increased the robot's guessing performance in the game interactions. At the same time, the robot behaves according to its emotional conditions to make the game play interesting for the elderly people.},

Dementia is one of the common cognitive problems among the elderly population where a basic daily dining activity could be difficult for them to perform. Drinking activities is one of the most important daily needs to keep a person away from dehydrating. Most of the existing works on dining activities recognitions are mainly based on wearable sensors and sensor rich eating utensil. Although the accuracy for sensor based techniques is high, some of the elderly might be reluctant to wear, and some might even forgot to wear altogether. In this paper, we propose a novel system that is purely based on depth data from an RGB-D camera for drinking activities recognition.

 abstract = {To promote independent living for elderly population activity recognition based approaches have been investigated deeply to infer the activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADLs). Deriving and integrating the gestural activities (such as talking, coughing, and deglutition etc.) along with activity recognition approaches can not only help identify the daily activities or social interaction of the older adults but also provide unique insights into their long-term health care, wellness management and ambulatory conditions. Gestural activities (GAs), in general, help identify fine-grained physiological symptoms and chronic psychological conditions which are not directly observable from traditional activities of daily living. In this paper, we propose GeSmart, an energy efficient wearable smart earring based GA recognition model for detecting a combination of speech and non-speech events. To capture the GAs we propose to use only the accelerometer sensor inside our smart earring due to its energy efficient operations and ubiquitous presence in everyday wearable devices. We present initial results and insights based on a C4.5 classification algorithm to infer the infrequent GAs. Subsequently, we propose a novel change-point detection based hybrid classification method exploiting the emerging patterns in a variety of GAs to detect and infer infrequent GAs. Experimental results based on real data traces collected from 10 users demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of GAs classification by over 23%, compared to previously proposed pure classification-based solutions. We also note that the accelerometer sensor based earrings are surprisingly informative and energy efficient (by 2.3 times) for identifying different types of GAs.},

 abstract = {In the Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan (UM), we have spent the past five years building social context into several courses in the traditional computer science (CS) curriculum. Specifically, freshman- and senior-level, project-based classes have been designed to both teach significant and appropriate academic content, while also building software games and apps for children with cognitive and/or physical disabilities within the university's associated hospital. Children with disabilities provide the context for these courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional curriculum. The cadence of the course(s) is typically: propose, pitch, form groups, design, build, test, and improve. Each student submits a written proposal for the project. A group of experts read all of the proposals, and choose the `best' for pitching to the other students in the course. Groups are formed, using student preferences, based upon the pitches. The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final) of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through subsequent independent studies or internships. If the software project is `minimally viable', the groups are encouraged to continue development and work with the university's Center for Entrepreneurship or Office of Technology Transfer toward eventual commercialization. During the past academic year (2013-2014), one of the senior-level courses had the singular focus of developing software apps and games for a 13 year old girl with athetoid cerebral palsy. Her family was actively involved in the course, filt- ring project ideas and offering suggestions for improvement. Some of the most promising apps are currently installed in the family's house for methodical review and eventual improvement. This paper will discuss the general process that is used in this style of course, the specific approach that was used during the 2013-2014 academic year, and offer general suggestions for implementation in disciplines other than computer science.},

 abstract = {The number of seniors and other people needing daily assistance continues to increase, but the current human resources available to achieve this in the coming years will certainly be insufficient. To remedy this situation, smart habitats have emerged as an innovative avenue for supporting needs of daily assistance. Smart homes aim to provide cognitive assistance in decision making by giving hints, suggestions, and reminders, with different kinds of effectors, to residents. To implement such technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of ongoing activity. Some researchers have proposed solutions based on binary sensors or cameras, but these types of approaches infringed on residents' privacy. A new affordable activity-recognition system based on passive RFID technology can detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The entire system relies on an innovative model of elliptical trilateration with several filters, as well as on an ingenious representation of activities with spatial zones. The authors have deployed the system in a real smart-home prototype; this article renders the results of a complete set of experiments conducted on this new activity-recognition system with real scenarios.},

 abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, the rate of people aged 60 or more is growing faster than any other age group in almost every country, and this trend is not going to change in a near future. Since senior citizens are at high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend will challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive computing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the onset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method relying on medical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and furniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a novel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect first the activities being performed and then the abnormal aspects in carrying out those activities, which are communicated to the medical center. Differently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the system and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an instrumented smart home. Experimental results show that our technique has a high precision while generating a small number of false positives.},

In this context, the proposed localization algorithm is able to provide the position information in terms of last room visited by the user improving considerably the reaction of a user's caregiver in emergency situations. This paper also aims at providing a performance characterization of the commercially available devices used in the GiraffPlus AAL environments. We prove that, in order to guarantee an high level of reliability, this kind of device show a considerable transmission delay that makes the localization process non-trivial.},

In this paper we present the design and evaluation of an ambient game, GuessMyCaption, aimed at enhancing the social networks of older adults, known to have an impact in their wellbeing. GuessMyCaption was deployed during a 5-weeks study in the home of one older adult and twelve relatives. The results demonstrate that GuessMyCaption is easy to use and maintains an older adult engaged with exercises while offering new opportunities for online and offline socialization. GuessMyCaption had a positive impact in the perceived wellbeing of the older adult improving her perception on her cognitive skills and physical health, and catalyzing socialization. This research shows that the use of natural interfaces and family memorabilia facilitate the adoption of serious games, improves older adults' perceived wellbeing, and encourage socialization.},

To successfully help the senior citizens, usually a monitoring system is needed that can gather and process data from various sensors about the healthcare condition of the user and environment parameters (noise level, light, humidity and temperature). In this paper we describe a cloud-based approach for monitoring the healthcare condition of senior citizens and the fusion of big data from heterogeneous information flows coming from the sensors. Furthermore, because context understanding is not easily done with a single source of metadata, we analyze metadata available from various online sources, aiming to understand the context of its users, in order to offer them personalized eHealth services.},

 abstract = {According to the WHO report in 2013, the world population aging over 60 years is predicted to increase to 20 million in 2050. Aging comes about many challenges to elders due to their cognitive decline, chronic age-related diseases, as well as limitations in physical activity, vision, and hearing. Recent advances in wearable computing and mobile health technology create new opportunity for ambient assisted living system to help the person perform the activities safely and independently. The activity monitoring of daily living is the core technique of the ambient assisted living system. Several well-known approaches have utilized various sensors for activity recognition such as camera, RFID, infrared detector and inertial sensor. Since the activities are well characterized by the objects, location or hand gesture that are manipulated during their performance on activities of daily living. However, some applications included, e.g. the monitoring of specific tasks and/or movements in a rehabilitation scenario or the classification of dietary intake gestures for an automated nutrition monitoring system, where reliable activity recognition on a more fine-grained level is needed. To fulfill the requirement, we design a hierarchical window approach based on the dynamic time warping algorithm to achieve fine-grained activity recognition, where the template selection and threshold configuration is developed to cope with the ambiguity with similar features. Furthermore, a confidence estimation for the pattern matching is also proposed. The recognition procedure was successfully adapted to the investigated cleaning tasks. The overall performance in precision, recall, and F1-socre is 89.0%, 88.6%, and 88.1% respectively. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is reliable and fulfills the requirements of the ambient assisted living.},

 abstract = {The growing of ageing population worldwide and the need to concentrate research efforts on a specific target group motivate our research and focus on frail ageing people with chronic disease and physical/cognitive deficiencies. The primary goal is to maintain frail and dependant people in their own home and delay as much as possible their placement in a nursing home, through reliable assistive technologies, to maximize their physical and mental function, and to continue to engage in social networks with the community, so that they can continue to lead an independent and purposeful life. Today, providing assistive services for frail and dependant people could be done following two ways: the first axis consists on seeking assistive technologies dedicated not only to end-users, but also, and even mainly, to helper around the user (relatives, neighbours, caregivers,..) to supervise Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The second axis could be to concentrate on rehabilitation and coaching solutions targeting people with chronic disease (ex. diabetes type 2) helping them modify their lifestyle to manage their health conditions. Such systems focus mainly on developing serious games deployable at home and connected to regional or national health information systems (e.g. the shared medical file database in France). Consequently, in both options, the development cost is high, and this is also the reason that most smart home projects are still at the research lab level worldwide. There are efforts trying to transfer the research lab demonstration prototypes into homes or nursing homes, but migrating systems from a well controlled research lab environment into a much more complex real-world environment introduces tremendous challenges in terms of correctness, reliability and fault-tolerant requirements. Our objective is to promote demonstration guidelines and lessons learned in order to reach this goal. The presented work focuses on the quality of life of ageing people having co- nitive and functional limitations, combined with diabetes type 2, and on recent achievements realised in France and Singapore.},

The GUI integrates an expressive mask allowing perspective taking with the aim to stimulate empathic exchanges. The second part focuses on the user evaluation, and reports the outcomes from three different tests. The results of the first two tests show a positive acceptance of the GUI by the older people. The final test reports qualitative comments by senior participants on the occurrence of empathic exchanges with the robot.},

 abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a research field whose main objective is to develop health monitoring systems for elderly patients at home, increasing the degree of patient independence during chronic diseases treatment. AAL systems are composed by several technologies: medical sensors and actuators, computer and mobile devices, Wireress Sensors Networks (WSN), computer networks, software infrastructure and applications. A comprehensive software infrastructure for AAL systems should use these technologies in an integrated manner and be able to cover scenarios involving several patient mobility level, patient locations, and levels of physical and cognitive abilities. The integration of AAL with the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies expands the scope of these systems with the ability to connect various sensors and actuators, integrating them into a single network that serves the purpose of patient health monitoring. In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive Cloud based IoT softwre infrastructure for Ambient Assisted Living. The main components of this software infrastructure are the M-Hub and the SDDL middleware. Preliminary results show that the proposed infrastructure has the potential to be applied in a wide range of health monitoring scenarios.},

This paper proposes the introduction of novel enriched linguistic tests and examines the hypothesis that language can be a sensitive cognitive measure for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A group of MCI and healthy elderly were administered a set of proposed linguistic tests. Performance measures were made on both groups to indicate that concrete verbal production deficits such as impaired verb fluency can distinguish the MCI from normal aging. In addition, it was found that even in cases where the MCI subjects preserved scores, language tests took significantly more time compared to healthy controls. These findings indicate that language could be a sensitive cognitive marker in preclinical stages of MCI.},

 abstract = {At DOMUS for the past 14 years, several cognitive orthotics were designed and implemented and evaluated, most of the time using participatory design. The resulting set of orthotics can support a wide variety of activities of daily living (ADL) to foster autonomy at home for people with cognitive impairments, e.g. medication, meal preparation, or budget. DOMUS benefits from a rich and versatile research infrastructure to design, implement, and evaluate such orthotics, namely a smart apartment on the campus, a living lab in an alternative housing unit for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), seniors' residences, personal residences (apartments and houses). To different extents, all these places can be considered as living labs. In this paper, building on our extensive experience, we first show that participative design is the best-suited methodology for developing cognitive orthotics in living labs. Clinical researchers, caregivers, and end users are involved from the start. This ensures that design is user driven and that assistive technologies will satisfy users needs. Then we propose a classification of living labs according to the levels of control one can have on which and how much technology is deployed, on how space is organized and how it may vary from experiment to experiment, and on how the progression and execution of a scenario can be constrained or not. For each category of living labs, we discuss their different yet complementary characteristics, highlighting their pros and cons. For instance, our smart apartment provides tight control over technology, space, and execution of predefined scenarios. Accordingly evaluations then provide a lot of useful and reliable information about technology and the ability for people to use it, but less on acceptance of the technology and its integration at one's real home in her daily life habits.},

 abstract = {The world senior population is projected to douDle as a percentage over the whole population in the next decades. In order to preserve or improve the quality of life of this population, as well as to keep healthcare costs sustainable, it is important to better support their ability of independent living. Cognitive decline is a major threat to independent living; it may be experienced in normal aging but it may also lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and more serious neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. Early detection of cognitive decline, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of its evolution for early intervention are a priority. Researchers have found that subtle differences in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) as well as the recognition of subtle errors while performing IADLs may be useful for MCI diagnosis as well as to differentiate different forms of cognitive disorders. However, occasionally performing ability tests in equipped rooms on medical premises has several shortcomings including cost and reliability of results. Pervasive computing coupled with intelligent data analysis can have a major role in this application domain by continuous monitoring of activities at home during daily life. This idea has been at the core of several recent research projects. The main challenges that we are facing are: a) reliability, unobtrusiveness and affordability of the sensor infrastructure, b) precision and robustness of techniques for IADL recognition, c) effectiveness of algorithms for recognizing fine-grained abnormal behaviors identified by clinicians as relevant indicators, d) identification of relevant patterns through long-term data analysis, e) privacy-awareness of data acquisition and management, f) effectiveness of visualization and interaction tools for clinicians. This talk will discuss the above challenges, report the experience on using hybrid statistical and knowledge-based techniques for addressing the recognition tasks, and - dentify critical aspects still to be investigated.},

Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

The core objectives are to provide emergency detection, improve quality of life, extend independence for the elderly, and detect patterns of behavior that could suggest early signs of a physical or cognitive issue, all in an unobtrusiveness manner. This paper specifically focuses on the development of the infrastructure integration component: PESTO and two of its sub components: a 3D visualization of the resident's smart apartment (VISMA) and a system to provide everyday task assistance through the Z-Wave home automation technology (ZAPS).},

 abstract = {Several researchers have proposed methods and designed systems for the automatic recognition of activities and abnormal behaviors with the goal of early detecting cognitive impairment. In this paper, we propose LOTAR, a hybrid behavioral analysis system coupling state of the art machine learning techniques with knowledge-based and data mining methods. Medical models designed in collaboration with cognitive neuroscience researchers guide the recognition of short- and long-term abnormal behaviors. In particular, we focus on historical behavior analysis for long-term anomaly detection, which is the principal novelty with respect to our previous works. We present preliminary results obtained by evaluating the method on a dataset acquired during three months of experimentation in a real patient's home. Results indicate the potential utility of the system for long-term monitoring of cognitive health.},

 abstract = {The rapidly growing elderly population in many parts of the world has started to impact private and public interests - emotionally, socially and economically. Specifically, current demographics, medical and social trends in the U.S. indicate a large population of older adults being at risk of early cognitive impairment and dementia. This motivates us to design innovative technology solutions for cognitive health assessment, care and well-being in elderly people in their own environments of daily life. Among many significant challenges involved in such technology assisted solutions, an important one is multi-modal sensing and complex sensor data analytics on resource constrained wearable and regularly used daily objects, particularly in the presence of uncertainty and noisy environments. An additional critical challenge is how to transfer the extracted knowledge into actionable information to be effectively used by family members, doctors and caregivers. This keynote talk will present our ongoing research on elderly cognitive care with the help of complex at-home activities recognition with smart wearable, and user emotional behavior signatures detection with smart chair. For activity recognition, our innovative methodology is the first of its kind that detects 21 fine-grained and complex at-home activities by wearable devices, as compared to typical 6-12 at-home activities recognized by relevant works in the existing literature. The smart chair based novel framework can accurately detect user functional and emotional activities, in addition to static and movement based sedentary postures that are more common in current works. In collaboration with Phelps County Regional Medical Center, the proposed solutions are being validated with clinical data and patient studies.},

 abstract = {Population pyramids have rapidly changed their shape worldwide. Specially in industrialised countries, where a steady ageing process is taking place. Due to the ageing of the population, age-related illnesses such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are becoming commonplace and healthcare systems struggle to improve the quality of life of patients and carers. Wandering and disorientation are common symptoms amongst patients with MCI, and they could lead to fatal outcomes. In this article we propose a wandering detection technique based on the analysis of randomness in patients' trajectories, which are gathered by means of standard low-cost mobile phones with GPS.},

 abstract = {Dementia is a clinical syndrome of cognitive deficits that involves both memory and functional impairments. While disruptions in cognition is a striking feature of dementia, it is also closely coupled with changes in functional and behavioral health of older adults. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of improving the automatic assessment of dementia, by better exploiting the emerging physiological sensors in conjunction with ambient sensors in a real field environment with IRB approval. We hypothesize that the cognitive health of older individuals can be estimated by tracking their daily activities and mental arousal states. We employ signal processing on wearable sensor data streams (e.g., Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), accelerometer (ACC)) and machine learning algorithms to assess cognitive impairments and its correlation with functional health decline. To validate our approach, we quantify the score of machine learning, survey and observation based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and signal processing based mental arousal state, respectively for functional and behavioral health measures among 17 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community in Baltimore. We compare clinically observed scores with technology guided automated scores using both machine learning and statistical techniques.},

 abstract = {Many countries are faced with a rapidly increasing economic and social challenge of caring for their elderly population. Cognitive issues are at the forefront of the list of concerns. People over the age of 75 are at risk for medically related cognitive decline and confusion, and the early detection of cognitive problems would allow for more effective clinical intervention. However, standard cognitive assessments are not diagnostically sensitive and are performed infrequently. To address these issues, we have developed a set of adaptive computer games to monitor cognitive performance in a home environment. Assessment algorithms for various aspects of cognition are embedded in the games. The monitoring of these metrics allows us to detect within subject trends over time, providing a method for the early detection of cognitive decline. In addition, the real-time information on cognitive state is used to adapt the user interface to the needs of the individual user. In this paper we describe the software architecture and methodology for monitoring cognitive performance using data from natural computer interactions in a home setting.},

 abstract = {The elderly are especially prone to the adverse health effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a common disorder in that population. While the prevalence and morbidity of COPD in the elderly are high, it is often undiagnosed and thus undertreated. The diagnosis of COPD is primarily based on the physiological documentation of airflow limitation using spirometry. However, several controversies exist as to the range of predicted normal values for these measurements in the elderly population, and the clinical presentation of COPD in the elderly may be complicated by the presence of several comorbidities. Many non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions are available for managing COPD. However, management of COPD in the elderly population may be challenged by the "polypharmacy" of medications that these patients often take, which can interfere with compliance with therapy. Additionally, the elderly often suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities that can prevent compliance with prescribed medications. Lastly, adverse effects from medications prescribed for treatment of COPD may be more pervasive in elderly patients.},

 abstract = {The vitamin folate functions within the cell as a carrier of one-carbon units. The requirement for one-carbon transfers is ubiquitous and all mammalian cells carry out folate dependent reactions. In recent years, low folate status has been linked to risk of numerous adverse health conditions throughout life from birth defects and complications of pregnancy to cardiovascular disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly. In many instances inadequate intake of folate seems to be the primary contributor but there is also evidence that an underlying genetic susceptibility can play a modest role by causing subtle alterations in the availability, metabolism or distribution of intermediates in folate related pathways. Folate linked one-carbon units are essential for DNA synthesis and repair and as a source of methyl groups for biological methylation reactions. The notion of common genetic variants being linked to risk of disease was relatively novel in 1995 when the first functional folate-related polymorphism was discovered. Numerous polymorphisms have now been identified in folate related genes and have been tested for functionality either as a modifier of folate status or as being associated with risk of disease. Moreover, there is increasing research into the importance of folate-derived one-carbon units for DNA and histone methylation reactions, which exert crucial epigenetic control over cellular protein synthesis. It is thus becoming clear that genetic aspects of folate metabolism are wide-ranging and may touch on events as disparate as prenatal imprinting to cancer susceptibility. This chapter will review the current knowledge in this area.},

 abstract = {The growing number of elderly population at home and abroad necessitates improved approaches to elderly care provision. Elders, often with cognitive and physical impairment, need assistance in their activities of daily living (ADLs), which is usually provided by human caregivers. As the demand for caregivers assistance increases, the shortage of traditional care resources becomes obvious. In this paper, we present the Virtual Caregiver (ViCare) framework that supports a human caregiver to monitor continuously the elderly by being aware of their surroundings. The ViCare system attempts to understand the elderly persons activities and contexts based on the data captured by the sensors placed in their environment and dynamically decides what services to provide them or whether there is a need to interrupt human caregiver depending on the type of activities. It not only minimizes the cognitive load of the human caregiver but also provides a seamless assistance to the elderly toward their improved health and well-being in their living environment. We conducted the experiments in an instrumented home environment and obtained positive results in terms of the satisfaction of the elderly, interaction event handling, caregivers acceptance and their engagement.},

 abstract = {Social and decision-making deficits are often the first symptoms of a striking number of neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging. These includes not only disorders that directly impact dopamine and basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disorder, but also degeneration in which multiple neural pathways are affected over the course of normal aging. The impact of such deficits can be dramatic, as in cases of financial fraud, which disproportionately affect the elderly. Unlike memory and motor impairments, however, which are readily recognized as symptoms of more serious underlying neurological conditions, social and decision-making deficits often do not elicit comparable concern in the elderly. Furthermore, few behavioral measures exist to quantify these deficits, due in part to our limited knowledge of the core cognitive components or their neurobiological substrates. Here we probe age-related differences in decision-making using a game theory paradigm previously shown to dissociate contributions of basal ganglia and prefrontal regions to behavior. Combined with computational modeling, we provide evidence that age-related changes in elderly participants are driven primarily by an over-reliance in trial-and-error reinforcement learning that does not take into account the strategic context, which may underlie cognitive deficits that contribute to social vulnerability in elderly individuals.},

Furthermore we investigated why the tablet proves to be an advantageous device to our target audience. Based on the results of our research, we developed a solution that incorporates cognitive and social mechanisms into its games, while performing iterative evaluations together with the final user by adopting a user-centered design methodology. In each design phase, a pre-selected group of senior participants experimented with the game platform and provided feedback to improve its features and usability. Through a series of short-term and a long-term evaluation, the game platform proved to be appealing to its intended users, providing an enjoyable gaming experience.},

 abstract = {Adolescence is a sensitive period of time for developing social abilities such as cognitive empathy. Thus, social experiences in this time period are more influential in forming the social abilities than during other periods in life. Video games are agent-based media in which game players carry out their own action in a mediated world whose rules are predefined by algorithms. This means that game players do not have to engage their cognitive empathy when playing games. Thus, prolonged use of video games during adolescence can result in the underdevelopment of cognitive empathy. This survey from three age groups (adolescents aged 16-19, adults aged 37-41, elders aged 58-62) demonstrated that only among adolescents was the amount of time spent in game play negatively associated with cognitive empathy. The findings of this study can contribute to understanding the nature of video game play and its negative effects by focusing on the manner of media use rather than the messages in media, and focusing on cognitive empathy, which has rarely been examined.},

 abstract = {The growing number of elderly individuals presents new challenges for society. Many elderly individuals have physical or cognitive impairments and require support from caregivers. An attempt to overcome the limitations caused by the lack of human caregivers is the inclusion of assistive technology such as socially active robots. The Domeo-project of the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme of the European Union aims to develop a new companion robotic system that would allow assistance to the elderly. The requirements and attitude of the potential users and caregivers have been assessed in Austria, France and Hungary. The robot functions were demonstrated to the participants. Three focus groups were formed: potential end users, older caregivers and younger caregivers. The discussions were recorded and processed according to six aspects: (i) acceptability and privacy, (ii) pertinence of services, (iii) possible obstacles, (iv) motivation level to use the proposed services, (v) organizational issues and (vi) recommendations. Minor differences were observed between the countries, but there were considerable differences regarding the age of the participants. The younger caregivers want to be assured of the safety of their client and to receive immediate notification in case of an emergency. As for the elderly, the most important aspect is to gain a companion and a physical helper. Many of the recommendations can be taken into consideration during robot development, but some of them are not realistic at present.},

 abstract = {Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue associated with significant healthcare costs and deterioration in quality of life. Previously, we reported the successful use of a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) training system in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we examine the feasibility of the BCI system with a new game that incorporates memory training in improving memory and attention in a pilot sample of healthy elderly. This study investigates the safety, usability and acceptability of our BCI system to elderly, and obtains an efficacy estimate to warrant a phase III trial. Thirty-one healthy elderly were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and waitlist control arms (n = 16). Intervention consisted of an 8-week training comprising 24 half-hour sessions. A usability and acceptability questionnaire was administered at the end of training. Safety was investigated by querying users about adverse events after every session. Efficacy of the system was measured by the change of total score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) before and after training. Feedback on the usability and acceptability questionnaire was positive. No adverse events were reported for all participants across all sessions. Though the median difference in the RBANS change scores between arms was not statistically significant, an effect size of 0.6SD was obtained, which reflects potential clinical utility according to Simon's randomized phase II trial design. Pooled data from both arms also showed that the median change in total scores pre and post-training was statistically significant (Mdn = 4.0; p<0.001). Specifically, there were significant improvements in immediate memory (p = 0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory (p<0.001) scores. Our BCI-based system shows promise in improving memory and attention in healthy elderly, and appears to be safe, user-friendly and acceptable to senior users. Given the efficacy signal, a phase III trial is warranted.},

Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes.},

First, a discussion of the relationship between cognitive and physical health shows the increasing weight given to the role of declines in cognition in the development of dependency in older adult population studies. Second, evidence that cognitive training produces 'far transfer' in elders is presented. The key issue is that one approach, known as extended practice training, has been successful in producing far transfer to memory and other processes. Its principles, which are consistent with those associated with positive brain plasticity effects, are identified. Those principles are then related to the mechanics of digital action games, which also have the important added feature of producing the experiences of presence, engagement, and flow, the subjective elements of game play that are likely to sustain interest and emotional investment in the skills practiced so that the play produces cognitive benefits. The specific cognitive abilities proposed to be improved by different types of game genres are outlined, and recent developments in game and interface design that may affect the willingness of older adults to play are described.},

 abstract = {With advanced technologies in hand, there exist potential applications and services built around monitoring activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly people at nursing homes. Most of the elderly people in these facilities are suffering from different chronic diseases such as dementia. Existing technologies are mainly focusing on non-medication interventions and monitoring of ADL for addressing loss of autonomy or well-being. Monitoring and managing ADL related to cognitive behaviors for non-medication intervention are very effective in improving dementia patients' conditions. However, cognitive functions of patients can be improved if appropriate recommendations of medications are delivered at a particular time. Previously we developed the Secured Wireless Sensor Network Integrated Cloud Computing for Ubiquitous-Life Care (SC(3)). SC(3) services were limited to monitoring ADL of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease and providing non-medication recommendations to the patient. In this article, we propose a system called the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an integral part of the SC(3) platform. Using the Smart CDSS, patients are provided with access to medication recommendations of expert physicians. Physicians are provided with an interface to create clinical knowledge for medication recommendations and to observe the patient's condition. The clinical knowledge created by physicians as the knowledge base of the Smart CDSS produces recommendations to the caregiver for medications based on each patient's symptoms.},

The type of the game, the number of launches for each game, the time spent on each game, the difficulty level, the success rate and perceived well-being of users have been studied and compared at the end of the first and the sixth months. The participants have played half an hour per day on average. The average time of playing per day in the sixth month was significantly higher than the average time of playing during the first month (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). The same result was found for the average number of game launches per day (p value < 7 * 10(-4)). However, older people seem not to launch more difficult levels in the last month. The success rate at sixth months was significantly higher than the success rate at the end of the first month (p value < 6.4 * 1010(-4)). Generally, seniors have had an improvement in their wellbeing score judged by themselves. Our study showed that the mobile application receives a good admission from users. The results are promising and can pave the way for improving cognitive function in the elderly patients. The use of tablets and the constitution of serious games in close cooperation with health professionals and elderly patients (the end user), are likely to provide satisfactory results to improve healthcare provided for elderly patients suffering from cognitive disorders.},

We propose methods to detect changes in behavioral routines by comparing activity curves and use these changes to analyze the possibility of changes in cognitive or physical health. We demonstrate our model and evaluate our change detection approach using a longitudinal smart home sensor dataset collected from 18 smart homes with older adult residents. Finally, we demonstrate how big data-based pervasive analytics such as activity curve-based change detection can be used to perform functional health assessment.

However, evaluating the UX of AAL technologies is a difficult task, due to the inherent limitations of their subjects and of the evaluation methods. In this study, we validated the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults while they use a cognitive stimulation application using a neural network trained to recognize pleasant and unpleasant emotions from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by contrasting our results with those of additional self-report and qualitative analysis UX evaluations. Our study results provide evidence about the feasibility of assessing the UX of older adults using a neural network that take as input the EEG signals; the classification accuracy of our neural network ranges from 60.87% to 82.61%. As future work we will conduct additional UX evaluation studies using the three different methods, in order to appropriately validate these results.},

 abstract = {The world's population is steadily ageing and as a result, health conditions related to ageing, such as dementia, have become a major public health concern. In 2001, it was estimated that there were almost 5 million Europeans suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this figure has been projected to almost double by 2040. About 40% of people over 85 suffer from AD, and another 10% from Parkinson's disease (PD). The majority of AD and PD cases are of sporadic origin and environmental factors play an important role in the aetiology. Epidemiological research identified airborne particulate matter (PM) as one of the environmental factors potentially involved in AD and PD pathogenesis. Also, cumulating evidence demonstrates that the smallest sizes of the inhalable fraction of ambient particulate matter, also referred to as ultrafine particulate matter or nano-sized particles, are capable of inducing effects beyond the respiratory system. Translocation of very small particles via the olfactory epithelium in the nose or via uptake into the circulation has been demonstrated through experimental rodent studies with engineered nanoparticles. Outdoor air pollution has been linked to several health effects including oxidative stress and neuroinflammation that may ultimately result in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. This review aims to evaluate the relationship between exposure to inhaled ambient particles and neurodegeneration.},

Reliable age-related interactions were found on health measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate. Heightened sensory conditions reduced the physiological measures of arousal in the younger group, whereas significant cardiovascular reactivity was found among the older group. The results are suggestive of the potential for increased cardiovascular risk as a function of sensory stimulation in the elderly despite improvements on cognitive tasks. Additional research is needed to evaluate the multidimensional effects of extended sensory stimulation on the elderly.},

 abstract = {Dementia, delirium and depression are the 3 most prevalent mental disorders in the elderly. While dementia and depression are prevalent in the community, hospitals and nursing homes, delirium is seen most often in acute care hospitals. Much of the management of these syndromes is undertaken by primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists. Therefore, it is imperative that generalist physicians be adept at recognising, evaluating and managing patients with these syndromes. Because no diagnostic tests are pathognomonic of these syndromes, the differential diagnosis hinges on a careful clinical evaluation. The first step is to recognise which of the syndromes is present. Dementia is defined by a chronic loss of intellectual or cognitive function of sufficient severity to interfere with social or occupational function. Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness marked by an attention deficit and a change in cognitive function. Depression is an affective disorder evidenced by a dysphoric mood, but the most pervasive symptom is a loss of ability to enjoy usual activities. It is important to recognise that these syndromes are not mutually exclusive, as dementia frequently coexists with delirium and depression. Furthermore, physical diagnoses, such as chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and endocrine disorders, are frequently associated with depressive symptoms. Given this, a comprehensive evaluation is mandatory. Laboratory tests are necessary to exclude concurrent metabolic, endocrine and infectious disorders, and drug effects. Imaging studies should be obtained selectively in patients with signs and symptoms, such as focal neurological findings and gait disturbances, which are suggestive of structural lesions: stroke, subdural haematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus and brain tumours. Appropriate management involving pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures will result in significant improvement in most patients with these syndromes. Potentially offending drugs should be discontinued. In delirious patients the underlying illness must be treated concomitantly with the use of psychotropics, if necessary. Although no current medications have been shown to have a significant effect on the functional status of patients with the 2 most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia, the management of concomitant illness in these patients may result in improved function for as long as a year. Tacrine, an anticholinesterase inhibitor, improves cognitive function slightly in selected patients with Alzheimer's disease over short periods. Finally, the treatment of depression with medications or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in significant reductions in mortality and morbidity.},

 abstract = {Previous research has documented qualitative changes in certain cognitive abilities during the older adult years, such as in short-term memory, perceptual and motor skills, and attentional capacities. Other work has suggested that a number of significant age-related changes, across a variety of cognitive abilities, are based on social experiences, such as occupational or recreational activities. The current study is based on earlier research by Perlmutter and her colleagues (1990) and examines age and skill-related differences among adults engaged in a social-recreational activity. BINGO players, ranging in age from nineteen to seventy-four, and having from less than two months to over twenty years of playing experience, were given a variety of psychometric, cognitive, and experimental measures. The participants were also observed as they played real BINGO games. No age-related differences were found on the psychometric or memory measures, suggesting that BINGO playing experience may have positive benefits for many older adults. Skilled players at all age levels were found to be more efficient in their game-playing actions. The oldest and most experienced players did not differ from the younger, equally experienced, players on the cognitive and skill-based tasks. These findings demonstrate the need to investigate adaptive competence in those situations in which social-environmental factors play a role in enhancing older adults' cognitive skills.},

 abstract = {Studies pertaining to health promoting behavior in daily life have received scant attention among medical anthropologists. The present study addresses this issue by means of an empirical analysis of perceptions and behaviors concerning a daily food item -eggs. Data were collected via in-depth interviews as well as participant observation in four retirement homes-two in Los Angeles and two in Taipei, Taiwan. The results reveal that practices of egg-restriction are pervasive throughout the four homes. Cholesterol has become a commonly-discussed issue in the daily lives of the 203 residents interviewed, and many of them were found to be preoccupied with the risk involved in excess consumption (especially of egg yolks) and increased serum cholesterol levels. Four forces: health professionals, family members, peer groups and mass media play important roles in constructing egg-consumption behaviors among the elderly subjects. The cognitive, psychological and behavioral impact of health information on elderly subjects has been discussed herein. It may be argued that the 'egg issue' reflects a shift in previous health paradigm thinking due to the biomedicalization of health promotion among Chinese elderly.},

 abstract = {Although elderly inmates form a small minority in the U.S. prison population (6.6%), this number is expected to increase by 2005. Elderly prisoners consist of first-time offenders, habitual offenders, and those who have "aged in place" (received very long sentences at a young age). Violence is an identified stressor affecting the elderly prisoner. This enduring stressor can add to physical deterioration, particularly in the inmate with chronic illness. Violence in prison falls into three categories: prisoner-prisoner, staff-prisoner, or prisoner-staff (Clear & Cole, 1994). Prisoner-prisoner incidents account for the majority of violence within prison systems. The convict in today's prison will use extremes of violence to combat threats to his or her reputation or self-concept of "machismo," or if the inmate feels "disrespected." The aging prisoner may have chronic, pervasive stress levels disguised under a tough veneer, although he or she may no longer be strong enough physically or emotionally to fend off potential attackers. Interventions with elderly prisoners include thorough physical and cognitive assessment, including signs and symptoms of depression or stress related to environmental disturbances. Educational training for correctional staff about age-specific developmental changes is necessary. Building partnerships with community, state, and national organizations can assist elderly inmates in their adjustment to prison and foster successful community release programs. Special care units may be considered for frail elderly inmates or those with chronic health problems.},
